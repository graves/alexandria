## BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
Joseph Fourier, 1768-1830

Fourier was born at Auxerre March 21, 1768, the son of a poor tailor. An orphan at eight, he was recommended by a friend to the Bishop of Auxerre, who obtained admission for him in the local military school conducted by the Benedictines of Saint-Maur. He quickly distinguished himself as a student and showed distinct literary ability; at twelve he was writing sermons which were often used with great effect in Paris. At the age of thirteen mathematics began to attract him strongly. The prescribed hours of study did not suffice; he arose at night, concealed himself behind a screen, and by the light of candle-ends carefully collected during the day, pursued his mathematical studies. When he was twenty-one he delivered his first memoir before the Academy of Sciences on the resolution of numerical equations of all degrees.

Educated by monks in a military school, Fourier seems to have considered that only the army or the church could provide a career. With a strong recommendation from Legendre he applied for admission to the artillery. He was refused with the statement, “Fourier, not being of noble birth, cannot enter the artillery, not even if he is a second Newton.” He then entered the Benedictine Order, where he remained as a novice from 1787 to 1789. Upon the outbreak of the Revolution he left the convent, although this did not result in any break with the Benedictines, since they immediately appointed him to the principal chair of mathematics at their school in Auxerre. When his colleagues became ill, he took their place, and besides teaching mathematics he also lectured on rhetoric, history, and philosophy.

At Auxerre, Fourier embraced the cause of the Revolution, joined the people's party, and served as publicist, recruiting agent, and member of the Citizens’ Committee of Surveillance; in this last function he exercised such moderation that he was himself in danger from the Terror. When, in 1794, the Normal School was instituted at Paris to train a specially selected group of new teachers, Fourier was among the fifteen hundred that were chosen, and, although he began as a student, he was soon made a “master of conference.” The school failed after a short time, but Fourier had so impressed the authorities that when the Polytechnic School was founded, he was appointed to its faculty, first as “superintendent of lectures on fortification” and then as “lecturer on analysis.”

Napoleon sometimes attended the sessions at the Polytechnic School, and when he organized the expedition to Egypt in 1798, Fourier was asked to be a part of it, although he was not informed of the role he was expected to play. Fourier was in Egypt for three years, engaged in the most varied activities: organizing factories for the army, constructing machines, leading scientific expeditions, and executing numerous administrative tasks. He acted as the representative of the general-in-chief, receiving complaints from the Egyptian populace, and for one period was virtually governor of half of Egypt. On the death of General Kléber he was called upon to present a eulogy before the French Army. As secretary of the Institute of Cairo he instigated the collection of materials for the famous *Description of Egypt*. In collaboration with Napoleon he wrote the historical introduction to this work, which established his literary reputation and eventually won him membership in the French Academy.

On his return to France in 1802 Fourier was appointed prefect of the Département of Isère and for the next thirteen years lived at Grenoble. He composed the disputes between the different parties and brought order out of the confusion left by the Revolution in his province. As part of a general policy of public improvements, he initiated an extensive road-building project and undertook the reclamation of marsh-lands which had been the source of infection for thirty-seven communes. In recognition of his services he was created Baron of the Empire in 1808.

His many administrative duties as prefect of Isère did not interrupt his work as a mathematician and man of letters. He conducted investigations into the motions of heat in solid bodies with the aim of reducing them to mathematical formulation, and in 1807 submitted his first paper on the subject to the Academy of Sciences. To induce the author to extend and improve his researches the Academy assigned as the problem for its prize competition of 1812, “The mathematical theory of the laws of the propagation of heat and the comparison of the results of this theory with exact experiment.” The judges were Laplace, Lagrange, and Legendre, and they awarded the prize to Fourier for his memoir in two parts, *Théorie des mouvements de la chaleur dans les corps solides*. The first part was republished in 1822 as the *Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur*.

Fourier continued to hold his position as prefect through the Revolution of 1814, but Napoleon’s return from Elba proved to be his political downfall. As Napoleon was approaching Grenoble, Fourier went to Lyons to notify the Bourbons that the city would undoubtedly capitulate. They refused to believe him and made him responsible for the safety of the city. Upon his return to Grenoble, which had surrendered, he was taken prisoner and brought before the Emperor. Napoleon confronted him: “You also have declared war against me? ... It only grieves me to see among my enemies an *Egyptian*, a man who has eaten along with me the bread of the bivouac, an old friend. How, moreover, could you have forgotten, Monsieur Fourier, that I have made you what you are?” Fourier’s loyalty was re-established, although he did not share Napoleon’s confidence of victory. The end of the Hundred Days and the Restoration found him deprived of political office, in disgrace, and almost penniless.

A friend and former pupil who was prefect of Paris made it possible for him to become Director of the Bureau of Statistics, which he remained until his death. His political past, however, did not prevent renewed recognition of his scientific abilities. In 1816 he was proposed for membership in the Academy of Sciences, and although Louis XVIII refused his consent at that time, he became a member the following year. He was made permanent secretary of the Division of Mathematical Sciences in 1822, member of the French Academy in 1826, and a year later succeeded Laplace as President of the Council for Improving the Polytechnic School. In 1828 he became a member of the government commission established for the encouragement of literature.

He died May 16, 1830, of aneurism of the heart, which had been aggravated by his habit of wrapping himself in all seasons like “an Egyptian mummy” and living in airless rooms at an excessively high temperature.

## PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE

Primary causes are unknown to us; but are subject to simple and constant laws, which may be discovered by observation, the study of them being the object of natural philosophy.

Heat, like gravity, penetrates every substance of the universe, its rays occupy all parts of space. The object of our work is to set forth the mathematical laws which this element obeys. The theory of heat will hereafter form one of the most important branches of general physics.

The knowledge of rational mechanics, which the most ancient nations had been able to acquire, has not come down to us, and the history of this science, if we except the first theorems in harmony, is not traced up beyond the discoveries of Archimedes. This great geometer explained the mathematical principles of the equilibrium of solids and fluids. About eighteen centuries elapsed before Galileo, the originator of dynamical theories, discovered the laws of motion of heavy bodies. Within this new science Newton comprised the whole system of the universe. The successors of these philosophers have extended these theories, and given them an admirable perfection: they have taught us that the most diverse phenomena are subject to a small number of fundamental laws which are reproduced in all the acts of nature. It is recognised that the same principles regulate all the movements of the stars, their form, the inequalities of their courses, the equilibrium and the oscillations of the seas, the harmonic vibrations of air and sonorous bodies, the transmission of light, capillary actions, the undulations of fluids, in fine the most complex effects of all the natural forces, and thus has the thought of Newton been confirmed: *quod tam paucis tam multa praestet geometria gloriatur*.

But whatever may be the range of mechanical theories, they do not apply to the effects of heat. These make up a special order of phenomena, which cannot be explained by the principles of motion and equilibrium. We have for a long time been in possession of ingenious instruments adapted to measure many of these effects; valuable observations have been collected; but in this manner partial results only have become known, and not the mathematical demonstration of the laws which include them all.

I have deduced these laws from prolonged study and attentive comparison of the facts known up to this time: all these facts I have observed afresh in the course of several years with the most exact instruments that have hitherto been used.

To found the theory, it was in the first place necessary to distinguish and define with precision the elementary properties which determine the action of heat. I then perceived that all the phenomena which depend on this action resolve themselves into a very small number of general and simple facts; whereby every physical problem of this kind is brought back to an investigation of mathematical analysis. From these general facts I have concluded that to determine numerically the most varied movements of heat, it is sufficient to submit each substance to three fundamental observations. Different bodies in fact do not possess in the same degree the power to contain heat, to receive or transmit it across their surfaces, nor to conduct it through the interior of their masses. These are the three specific qualities which our theory clearly distinguishes and shows how to measure.

It is easy to judge how much these researches concern the physical sciences and civil economy, and what may be their influence on the progress of the arts which require the employment and distribution of heat. They have also a necessary connection with the system of the world, and their relations become known when we consider the grand phenomena which take place near the surface of the terrestrial globe.

In fact, the radiation of the sun in which this planet is incessantly plunged, penetrates the air, the earth, and the waters; its elements are divided, change in direction every way, and, penetrating the mass of the globe, would raise its mean temperature more and more, if the heat acquired were not exactly balanced by that which escapes in rays from all points of the surface and expands through the sky.

Different climates, unequally exposed to the action of solar heat, have, after an immense time, acquired the temperatures proper to their situation. This effect is modified by several accessory causes, such as elevation, the form of the ground, the neighbourhood and extent of continents and seas, the state of the surface, the direction of the winds.

The succession of day and night, the alternations of the seasons occasion in the solid earth periodic variations, which are repeated every day or every year: but these changes become less and less sensible as the point at which they are measured recedes from the surface. No diurnal variation can be detected at the depth of about three metres [ten feet]; and the annual variations cease to be appreciable at a depth much less than sixty metres. The temperature at great depths is then sensibly fixed at a given place: but it is not the same at all points of the same meridian; in general it rises as the equator is approached.

The heat which the sun has communicated to the terrestrial globe, and which has produced the diversity of climates, is now subject to a movement which has become uniform. It advances within the interior of the mass which it penetrates throughout, and at the same time recedes from the plane of the equator, and proceeds to lose itself across the polar regions.

In the higher regions of the atmosphere the air is very rare and transparent, and retains but a minute part of the heat of the solar rays: this is the cause of the excessive cold of elevated places. The lower layers, denser and more heated by the land and water, expand and rise up: they are cooled by the very fact of expansion. The great movements of the air, such as the trade winds which blow between the tropics, are not determined by the attractive forces of the moon and sun. The action of these celestial bodies produces scarcely perceptible oscillations in a fluid so rare and at so great a distance. It is the changes of temperature which periodically displace every part of the atmosphere.

The waters of the ocean are differently exposed at their surface to the rays of the sun, and the bottom of the basin which contains them is heated very unequally from the poles to the equator. These two causes, ever present, and combined with gravity and the centrifugal force, keep up vast movements in the interior of the seas. They displace and mingle all the parts, and produce those general and regular currents which navigators have noticed.

Radiant heat which escapes from the surface of all bodies, and traverses elastic media, or spaces void of air, has special laws, and occurs with widely varied phenomena. The physical explanation of many of these facts is already known; the mathematical theory which I have formed gives an exact measure of them. It consists, in a manner, in a new catoptrics which has its own theorems, and serves to determine by analysis all the effects of heat direct or reflected.

The enumeration of the chief objects of the theory sufficiently shows the nature of the questions which I have proposed to myself. What are the elementary properties which it is requisite to observe in each substance, and what are the experiments most suitable to determine them exactly? If the distribution of heat in solid matter is regulated by constant laws, what is the mathematical expression of those laws, and by what analysis may we derive from this expression the complete solution of the principal problems? Why do terrestrial temperatures...

peratures cease to be variable at a depth so small with respect to the radius of the earth? Every inequality in the movement of this planet necessarily occasioning an oscillation of the solar heat beneath the surface, what relation is there between the duration of its period and the depth at which the temperatures become constant?

What time must have elapsed before the climates could acquire the different temperatures which they now maintain, and what are the different causes which can now vary their mean heat? Why do not the annual changes alone in the distance of the sun from the earth produce at the surface of the earth very considerable changes in the temperatures?

From what characteristic can we ascertain that the earth has not entirely lost its original heat, and what are the exact laws of the loss?

If, as several observations indicate, this fundamental heat is not wholly dissipated, it must be immense at great depths, and nevertheless it has no sensible influence at the present time on the mean temperature of the climates. The effects which are observed in them are due to the action of the solar rays. But independently of these two sources of heat, the one fundamental and primitive proper to the terrestrial globe, the other due to the presence of the sun, is there not a more universal cause which determines the temperature of the heavens in that part of space which the solar system now occupies? Since the observed facts necessitate this cause, what are the consequences of an exact theory in this entirely new question; how shall we be able to determine that constant value of the temperature of space, and deduce from it the temperature which belongs to each planet?

To these questions must be added others which depend on the properties of radiant heat. The physical cause of the reflection of cold, that is to say, the reflection of a lesser degree of heat, is very distinctly known; but what is the mathematical expression of this effect?

On what general principles do the atmospheric temperatures depend, whether the thermometer which measures them receives the solar rays directly, on a surface metallic or unpolished, or whether this instrument remains exposed, during the night, under a sky free from clouds, to contact with the air?

to radiation from terrestrial bodies, and to that from the most distant and coldest parts of the atmosphere?

The intensity of the rays which escape from a point on the surface of any heated body varying with their inclination according to a law which experiments have indicated, is there not a necessary mathematical relation between this law and the general fact of the equilibrium of heat; and what is the physical cause of this inequality in intensity?

Lastly, when heat penetrates fluid masses, and determines in them internal movements by continual changes of the temperature and density of each molecule, can we still express, by differential equations, the laws of such a compound effect; and what is the resulting change in the general equations of hydrodynamics?

Such are the chief problems which I have solved, and which have never yet been submitted to calculation. If we consider further the manifold relations of this mathematical theory to civil uses and the technical arts, we shall recognize completely the extent of its applications. It is evident that it includes an entire series of distinct phenomena, and that the study of it cannot be omitted without losing a notable part of the science of nature.

The principles of the theory are derived, as are those of rational mechanics, from a very small number of primary facts, the causes of which are not considered by geometers, but which they admit as the results of common observations confirmed by all experiment.

The differential equations of the propagation of heat express the most general conditions, and reduce the physical questions to problems of pure analysis, and this is the proper object of theory. They are not less rigorously established than the general equations of equilibrium and motion. In order to make this comparison more perceptible, we have always preferred demonstrations analogous to those of the theorems which serve as the foundation of statics and dynamics. These equations still exist, but receive a different form, when they express the distribution of luminous heat in transparent bodies, or the movements which the changes of temperature and density occasion in the interior of fluids. The coefficients which they contain are subject to variations whose exact measure is not yet known, but in all the natural problems which it most concerns us to consider, the limits of temperature differ so little that we may omit the variations of these coefficients.

The equations of the movement of heat, like those which express the vibrations of sonorous bodies, or the ultimate oscillations of liquids, belong to one of the most recently discovered branches of analysis, which it is very important to perfect. After having established these differential equations, their integrals must be obtained; this process consists in passing from a common expression to a particular solution subject to all the given conditions. This difficult investigation requires a special analysis founded on new theorems, whose object we could not in this place make known. The method which is derived from them leaves nothing vague and indeterminate in the solutions; it leads them up to the final numerical applications, a necessary condition of every investigation, without which we should only arrive at useless transformations.

The same theorems which have made known to us the equations of the movement of heat apply directly to certain problems of general analysis and dynamics whose solution has for a long time been desired.

Profound study of nature is the most fertile source of mathematical discoveries. Not only has this study, in offering a determinate object to investigation, the advantage of excluding vague questions and calculations without issue; it is besides a sure method of forming analysis itself, and of discovering the elements which it concerns us to know, and which natural science ought always to preserve: these are the fundamental elements which are reproduced in all natural effects.

We see, for example, that the same expression whose abstract properties geometers had considered, and which in this respect belongs to general analysis, represents as well the motion of light in the atmosphere, as it determines the laws of diffusion of heat in solid matter, and enters into all the chief problems of the theory of probability.

The analytical equations, unknown to the ancient geometers, which Descartes was the first to introduce into the study of curves and surfaces, are not restricted to the properties of figures, and to those properties which are the object of rational mechanics; they extend to all general phenomena. There cannot be a language more universal and more simple, more free from errors and from obscurities, that is to say, more worthy to express the invariable relations of natural things.

Considered from this point of view, mathematical analysis is as extensive as nature itself; it defines all perceptible relations, measures times, spaces, forces, temperatures. This difficult science is formed slowly, but it preserves every principle which it has once acquired; it grows and strengthens itself incessantly in the midst of the many variations and errors of the human mind.

Its chief attribute is clearness; it has no marks to express confused notions. It brings together phenomena the most diverse, and discovers the hidden analogies which unite them. If matter escapes us, as that of air and light, by its extreme tenuity, if bodies are placed far from us in the immensity of space, if man wishes to know the aspect of the heavens at successive epochs separated by a great number of centuries, if the actions of gravity and of heat are exerted in the interior of the earth at depths which will be always inaccessible, mathematical analysis can yet lay hold of the laws of these phenomena. It makes them present and measurable, and seems to be a faculty of the human mind destined to supplement the shortness of life and the imperfection of the senses; and what is still more remarkable, it follows the same course in the study of all phenomena; it interprets them by the same language, as if to attest the unity and simplicity of the plan of the universe, and to make still more evident that unchangeable order which presides over all natural causes.

The problems of the theory of heat present so many examples of the simple and constant dispositions which spring from the general laws of nature; and if the order which is established in these phenomena could be grasped by our senses, it would produce in us an impression comparable to the sensation of musical sound.

The forms of bodies are infinitely varied; the distribution of the heat which penetrates them seems to be arbitrary and confused; but all the inequalities are rapidly cancelled and disappear as time passes on. The progress of the phenomenon becomes more regular and simpler, remains finally subject to a definite law which is the same in all cases, and which bears no sensible impress of the initial arrangement.

All observation confirms these consequences. The analysis from which they are derived separates and expresses clearly: first, the general conditions, that is to say, those which spring from the natural properties of heat; second, the effect, accidental but continued, of the form or state of the surfaces; third, the effect, not permanent, of the primitive distribution.

In this work we have demonstrated all the principles of the theory of heat, and solved all the fundamental problems. They could have been explained more concisely by omitting the simpler problems, and presenting in the first instance the most general results; but we wished to show the actual origin of the theory and its gradual progress. When this knowledge has been acquired and the principles thoroughly fixed, it is preferable to employ at once the most extended analytical methods, as we have done in the later investigations. This is also the course which we shall hereafter follow in the memoirs which will be added to this work, and which will form in some manner its complement; and by this means we shall have reconciled, so far as it can depend on ourselves, the necessary development of principles with the precision which becomes the applications of analysis.

The subjects of these memoirs will be: the theory of radiant heat, the problem of the terrestrial temperatures, that of the temperature of dwellings, the comparison of theoretic results with those which we have observed in different experiments, lastly, the demonstrations of the differential equations of the movement of heat in fluids.

The work which we now publish has been written a long time since; different circumstances have delayed and often interrupted the printing of it. In this interval, science has been enriched by important observations; the principles of our analysis, which had not at first been grasped, have become better known; the results which we had deduced from them have been discussed and confirmed. We ourselves have applied these principles to new problems, and have changed the form of some of the proofs. The delays of publication will have contributed to make the work clearer and more complete.

The subject of our first analytical investigations on the transfer of heat was its distribution amongst separated masses; these have been preserved in Chapter IV, Section II. The problems relative to continuous bodies, which form the theory rightly so called, were solved many years afterwards; this theory was explained for the first time in a manuscript work forwarded to the Institute of France at the end of the year 1807, an extract from which was published in the *Bulletin des Sciences* (*Société Philomatique*, year 1808, page 112). We added to this memoir, and successively forwarded very extensive notes, concerning the convergence of series, the diffusion of heat in an infinite prism, its emission in spaces void of air, the constructions suitable for exhibiting the chief theorems, and the analysis of the periodic movement at the surface of the earth. Our second memoir, on the propagation of heat, was deposited in the archives of the Institute, on the 28th of September, 1811. It was formed out of the preceding memoir and the notes already sent in; the geometrical constructions and those details of analysis which had no necessary relation to the physical problem were omitted, and to it was added the general equation which expresses the state of the surface. This second work was sent to press in the course of 1821, to be inserted in the collection of the Academy of Sciences. It is printed without any change or addition; the text agrees literally with the deposited manuscript, which forms part of the archives of the Institute.

In this memoir, and in the writings which preceded it, will be found a first explanation of applications which our actual work does not contain: they will be treated in the subsequent memoirs at greater length, and, if it be in our power, with greater clearness. The results of our labours concerning the same problems are also indicated in several articles already published. The extract inserted in the *Annales de Chimie et de Physique* shows the aggregate of our researches (Vol. III, page 350, year 1816). We published in the *Annales* two separate notes, concerning radiant heat (Vol. IV, page 128, year 1817, and Vol. VI, page 259, year 1817).

Several other articles of the same collection present the most constant results of theory and observation; the utility and the extent of thermological knowledge could not be better appreciated than by the celebrated editors of the *Annales*.[^1]

In the *Bulletin des Sciences* (*Société Philomatique*, year 1818, page 1, and year 1820, page 60) will be found an extract from a memoir on the constant or variable temperature of dwellings, and an explanation of the chief consequences of our analysis of the terrestrial temperatures.

M. Alexandre de Humboldt, whose researches embrace all the great problems of natural philosophy, has considered the observations of the temperatures proper to the different climates from a novel and very important point of view (*Memoir on Isothermal lines*, *Société d’Arcueil*, Vol. III, page 462); (*Memoir on the inferior limit of perpetual snow*, *Annales de Chimie et de Physique*, Vol. V, page 102, year 1817).

As to the differential equations of the movement of heat in fluids, mention has been made of them in the annual history of the Academy of Sciences. The extract from our memoir shows clearly its object and principle. (*Analyse des travaux de l'Académie des Sciences*, by M. De Lambre, year 1820.)

The examination of the repulsive forces produced by heat, which determine the statical properties of gases, does not belong to the analytical subject which we have considered. This question, connected with the theory of radiant heat, has just been discussed by the illustrious author of the *Mécanique céleste*, to whom all the chief branches of mathematical analysis owe important discoveries. (*Connaissance des Temps*, years 1824-5.)

The new theories explained in our work are united forever to the mathematical sciences, and rest like them on invariable foundations; all the elements which they at present possess they will preserve, and will continually acquire greater extent. Instruments will be perfected and experiments multiplied. The analysis which we have formed will be deduced from more general, that is to say, more simple and more fertile methods common to many classes of phenomena. For all substances, solid or liquid, for vapours and permanent gases, determinations will be made of all the specific qualities relating to heat, and of the variations of the coefficients which express them. At different stations on the earth, observations will be made of the temperatures of the ground at different depths, of the intensity of the solar heat and its effects, constant or variable, in the atmosphere, in the ocean and in lakes; and the constant temperature of the heavens proper to the planetary regions will become known. The theory itself will direct all these measures, and assign their precision. No considerable progress can hereafter be made which is not founded on experiments such as these; for mathematical analysis can deduce from general and simple phenomena the expression of the laws of nature; but the special application of these laws to very complex effects demands a long series of exact observations.

## Introduction

### Section I. Statement of the Object of the Work

1. The effects of heat are subject to constant laws which cannot be discovered without the aid of mathematical analysis. The object of the theory which we are about to explain is to demonstrate these laws; it reduces all physical researches on the propagation of heat to problems of the integral calculus whose elements are given by experiment. No subject has more extensive relations with the progress of industry and the natural sciences; for the action of heat is always present, it penetrates all bodies and spaces, it influences the processes of the arts, and occurs in all the phenomena of the universe.

When heat is unequally distributed among the different parts of a solid mass, it tends to attain equilibrium, and passes slowly from the parts which are more heated to those which are less; and at the same time it is dissipated at the surface, and lost in the medium or in the void. The tendency to uniform distribution and the spontaneous emission which acts at the surface of bodies change continually the temperature at their different points. The problem of the propagation of heat consists in determining what is the temperature at each point of a body at a given instant, supposing that the initial temperatures are known. The following examples will more clearly make known the nature of these problems.

2. If we expose to the continued and uniform action of a source of heat the same part of a metallic ring, whose diameter is large, the molecules nearest to the source will be first heated, and, after a certain time, every point of the solid will have acquired very nearly the highest temperature which it can attain. This limit or greatest temperature is not the same at different points; it becomes less and less according as they become more distant from that point at which the source of heat is directly applied.

When the temperatures have become permanent, the source of heat supplies, at each instant, a quantity of heat which exactly compensates for that which is dissipated at all the points of the external surface of the ring.

If now the source be suppressed, heat will continue to be propagated in the interior of the solid, but that which is lost in the medium or the void will no longer be compensated as formerly by the supply from the source, so that all the temperatures will vary and diminish incessantly until they have become equal to the temperatures of the surrounding medium.

3. Whilst the temperatures are permanent and the source remains, if at every point of the mean circumference of the ring an ordinate be raised perpendicular to the plane of the ring, whose length is proportional to the fixed temperature at that point, the curved line which passes through the ends of these ordinates will represent the permanent state of the temperatures, and it is very easy to determine by analysis the nature of this line. It is to be remarked that the thickness of the ring is supposed to be sufficiently small for the temperature to be sensibly equal at all points of the same section perpendicular to the mean circumference. When the source is removed, the line which bounds the ordinates proportional to the temperatures at the different points will change its form continually. The problem consists in expressing, by one equation, the variable form of this curve, and in thus including in a single formula all the successive states of the solid.

4. Let *z* be the constant temperature at a point *m* of the mean circumference, *x* the distance of this point from the source, that is to say, the length of the arc of the mean circumference, included between the point *m* and the point *o* which corresponds to the position of the source; *z* is the highest temperature which the point *m* can attain by virtue of the constant action of the source, and this permanent temperature *z* is a function *f(x)* of the distance *x*. The first part of the problem consists in determining the function *f(x)* which represents the permanent state of the solid.

Consider next the variable state which succeeds to the former state as soon as the source has been removed; denote by *t* the time which has passed since the suppression of the source, and by *v* the value of the temperature at the point *m* after the time *t*. The quantity *v* will be a certain function *F(x, t)* of the distance *x* and the time *t*; the object of the problem is to discover this function *F(x, t)*, of which we only know as yet that the initial value is *f(x)*, so that we ought to have the equation *f(x) = F(x, 0)*.

5. If we place a solid homogeneous mass, having the form of a sphere or cube, in a medium maintained at a constant temperature, and if it remains immersed for a very long time, it will acquire at all its points a temperature differing very little from that of the fluid. Suppose the mass to be withdrawn in order to transfer it to a cooler medium, heat will begin to be dissipated at its surface; the temperatures at different points of the mass will not be sensibly the same, and if we suppose it divided into an infinity of layers by surfaces parallel to its external surface, each of those layers will transmit, at each instant, a certain quantity of heat to the layer which surrounds it. If it be imagined that each molecule carries a separate thermometer, which indicates its temperature at every instant, the state of the solid will from time to time be represented by the variable system of all these thermometric heights. It is required to express the successive states by analytical formulae, so that we may know at any given instant the temperatures indicated by each thermometer, and compare the quantities of heat which flow during the same instant, between two adjacent layers, or into the surrounding medium.

6. If the mass is spherical, and we denote by *x* the distance of a point of this mass from the centre of the sphere, by *t* the time which has elapsed since the commencement of the cooling, and by *v* the variable temperature of the point *m*, it is easy to see that all points situated at the same distance *x* from the centre of the sphere have the same temperature *v*. This quantity *v* is a certain function *F(x, t)* of the radius *x* and of the time *t*; it must be such that it becomes constant whatever be the value of *x*, when we suppose *t* to be nothing; for by hypothesis, the temperature at all points is the same at the moment of emersion. The problem consists in determining that function of *x* and *t* which expresses the value of *v*.

7. In the next place it is to be remarked, that during the cooling, a certain quantity of heat escapes, at each instant, through the external surface, and passes into the medium. The value of this quantity is not constant; it is greatest at the beginning of the cooling. If however we consider the variable state of the internal spherical surface whose radius is *x*, we easily see that there must be at each instant a certain quantity of heat which traverses that surface, and passes through that part of the mass which is more distant from the centre. This continuous flow of heat is variable like that through the external surface, and both are quantities comparable with each other; their ratios are numbers whose varying values are functions of the distance *x* and of the time *t* which has elapsed. It is required to determine these functions.

8. If the mass, which has been heated by a long immersion in a medium, and whose rate of cooling we wish to calculate, is of cubical form, and if we determine the position of each point *m* by three rectangular co-ordinates *x, y, z*, taking for origin the centre of the cube, and for axes lines perpendicular to the faces, we see that the temperature *v* of the point *m* after the time *t*, is a function of the four variables *x, y, z*, and *t*. The quantities of heat which flow out at each instant through the whole external surface of the solid are variable and comparable with each other; their ratios are analytical functions depending on the time *t*, the expression of which must be assigned.

9. Let us examine also the case in which a rectangular prism of sufficiently great thickness and of infinite length, being submitted at its extremity to a constant temperature, whilst the air which surrounds it is maintained at a less temperature, has at last arrived at a fixed state which it is required to determine. All the points of the extreme section at the base of the prism have, by hypothesis, a common and permanent temperature. It is not the same with a section distant from the source of heat; each of the points of this rectangular surface parallel to the base has acquired a fixed temperature, but this is not the same at different points of the same section, and must be less at points nearer to the surface exposed to the air. We see also that, at each instant, there flows across a given section a certain quantity of heat, which always remains the same, since the state of the solid has become constant. The problem consists in determining the permanent temperature at any given point of the solid, and the whole quantity of heat which, in a definite time, flows across a section whose position is given.

10. Take as origin of coordinates x, y, z, the centre of the base of the prism, and as rectangular axes, the axis of the prism itself, and the two perpendiculars on the sides: the permanent temperature *v* of the point *m*, whose coordinates are x, y, z, is a function of three variables F(x, y, z): it has, by hypothesis, a constant value when we suppose x to be nothing, whatever be the values of y and z. Suppose we take for the unit of heat that quantity which in the unit of time would emerge from an area equal to a unit of surface, if the heated mass which that area bounds, and which is formed of the same substance as the prism, were continually maintained at the temperature of boiling water, and immersed in atmospheric air maintained at the temperature of melting ice.

We see that the quantity of heat which, in the permanent state of the rectangular prism, flows, during a unit of time, across a certain section perpendicular to the axis, has a determinate ratio to the quantity of heat taken as unit. This ratio is not the same for all sections: it is a function φ(x) of the distance x, at which the section is situated. It is required to find an analytical expression of the function φ(x).

11. The foregoing examples suffice to give an exact idea of the different problems which we have discussed.

The solution of these problems has made us understand that the effects of the propagation of heat depend, in the case of every solid substance, on three elementary qualities, which are, its capacity for heat, its own conductivity, and the exterior conductivity.

It has been observed that if two bodies of the same volume and of different nature have equal temperatures, and if the same quantity of heat be added to them, the increments of temperature are not the same; the ratio of these increments is the inverse ratio of their capacities for heat. In this manner, the first of the three specific elements which regulate the action of heat is exactly defined, and physicists have for a long time known several methods of determining its value. It is not the same with the two others; their effects have often been observed, but there is but one exact theory which can fairly distinguish, define, and measure them with precision.

The proper, or interior, conductivity of a body expresses the facility with which heat is propagated in passing from one internal molecule to another. The external, or relative, conductivity of a solid body depends on the facility with which heat penetrates the surface, and passes from this body into a given medium, or passes from the medium into the solid. The last property is modified by the more or less polished state of the surface; it varies also according to the medium in which the body is immersed; but the interior conductivity can change only with the nature of the solid.

These three elementary qualities are represented in our formulae by constant numbers, and the theory itself indicates experiments suitable for measuring their values. As soon as they are determined, all the problems relating to the propagation of heat depend only on numerical analysis. The knowledge of these specific properties may be directly useful in several applications of the physical sciences; it is besides an element in the study and description of different substances. It is a very imperfect knowledge of bodies which ignores the relations which they have with one of the chief agents of nature. In general, there is no mathematical theory which has a closer relation than this with public economy, since it serves to give clearness and perfection to the practice of the numerous arts which are founded on the employment of heat.

12. The problem of terrestrial temperatures presents one of the most beautiful applications of the theory of heat; the general idea to be formed of it is this: Different parts of the surface of the globe are unequally exposed to the influence of the solar rays; the intensity of their action depends on the latitude of the place; it changes also in the course of the day and in the course of the year, and is subject to other less perceptible inequalities. It is evident that, between the variable state of the surface and that of the internal temperatures, a necessary relation exists, which may be derived from theory. We know that, at a certain depth below the surface of the earth, the temperature at a given place experiences no annual variation: this permanent underground temperature becomes less and less according as the place is more and more distant from the equator. We may then leave out of consideration the exterior envelope, the thickness of which is incomparably small with respect to the earth’s radius, and regard our planet as a nearly spherical mass, whose surface is subject to a temperature which remains constant at all points on a given parallel, but is not the same on another parallel. It follows from this that every internal molecule has also a fixed temperature determined by its position. The mathematical problem consists in discovering the fixed temperature at any given point and the law which the solar heat follows whilst penetrating the interior of the earth.

This diversity of temperature interests us still more, if we consider the changes which succeed each other in the envelope itself on the surface of which we dwell. Those alternations of heat and cold which are reproduced every day and in the course of every year, have been up to the present time the object of repeated observations. These we can now submit to calculation, and from a common theory derive all the particular facts which experience has taught us. The problem is reducible to the hypothesis that every point of a vast sphere is affected by periodic temperatures; analysis then tells us according to what law the intensity of these variations decreases according as the depth increases, what is the amount of the annual or diurnal changes at a given depth, the epoch of the changes, and how the fixed value of the underground temperature is deduced from the variable temperatures observed at the surface.

13. The general equations of the propagation of heat are partial differential equations, and though their form is very simple, the known methods do not furnish any general mode of integrating them; we could not, therefore, deduce from them the values of the temperatures after a definite time. The numerical interpretation of the results of analysis is, however, necessary, and it is a degree of perfection which it would be very important to give to every application of analysis to the natural sciences. So long as it is not obtained, the solutions may be said to remain incomplete and useless, and the truth which it is proposed to discover is no less hidden in the formulae of analysis than it was in the physical problem itself. We have applied ourselves with much care to this purpose, and we have been able to overcome the difficulty in all the problems of which we have treated, and which contain the chief elements of the theory of heat. There is not one of the problems whose solution does not provide convenient and exact means for discovering the numerical values of the temperatures acquired, or those of the quantities of heat which have flowed through, when the values of the time and of the variable coordinates are known. Thus will be given not only the differential equations which the functions that express the values of the temperatures must satisfy, but the functions themselves will be given under a form which facilitates the numerical applications.

14. In order that these solutions might be general and have an extent equal to that of the problem, it was requisite that they should accord with the initial state of the temperatures, which is arbitrary. The examination of this condition shows that we may develop in convergent series, or express by definite integrals, functions which are not subject to a constant law, and which represent the ordinates of irregular or discontinuous lines. This property throws a new light on the theory of partial differential equations and extends the employment of arbitrary functions by submitting them to the ordinary processes of analysis.

15. It still remained to compare the facts with theory. With this view, varied and exact experiments were undertaken, whose results were in conformity with those of analysis and gave them an authority which one would have been disposed to refuse to them in a new matter which seemed subject to so much uncertainty. These experiments confirm the principle from which we started and which is adopted by all physicists in spite of the diversity of their hypotheses on the nature of heat.

16. Equilibrium of temperature is effected not only by way of contact; it is established also between bodies separated from each other, which are situated for a long time in the same region. This effect is independent of contact with a medium; we have observed it in spaces wholly void of air. To complete our theory it was necessary to examine the laws which radiant heat follows, on leaving the surface of a body. It results from the observations of many physicists and from our own experiments, that the intensities of the different rays, which escape in all directions from any point in the surface of a heated body, depend on the angles which their directions make with the surface at the same point. We have proved that the intensity of a ray diminishes as the ray makes a smaller angle with the element of surface and that it is proportional to the sine of that angle. This general law of emission of heat, which different observations had already indicated, is a necessary consequence of the principle of the equilibrium of temperature and of the laws of propagation of heat in solid bodies.

Such are the chief problems which have been discussed in this work; they are all directed to one object only: to establish clearly the mathematical principles of the theory of heat and to keep up in this way with the progress of the useful arts and of the study of nature.

17. From what precedes, it is evident that a very extensive class of phenomena exists, not produced by mechanical forces, but resulting simply from the presence and accumulation of heat. This part of natural philosophy cannot be connected with dynamical theories; it has principles peculiar to itself and is founded on a method similar to that of other exact sciences. The solar heat, for example, which penetrates the interior of the globe, distributes itself therein according to a regular law which does not depend on the laws of motion and cannot be determined by the principles of mechanics. The dilatations which the repulsive force of heat produces, observation of which serves to measure temperatures, are in truth dynamical effects; but it is not these dilatations which we calculate when we investigate the laws of the propagation of heat.

18. There are other more complex natural effects which depend at the same time on the influence of heat and of attractive forces: thus, the variations of temperatures which the movements of the sun occasion in the atmosphere and in the ocean, change continually the density of the different parts of the air and the waters. The effect of the forces which these masses obey is modified at every instant by a new distribution of heat, and it cannot be doubted that this cause produces the regular winds and the chief currents of the sea; the solar and lunar attractions occasioning in the atmosphere effects but slightly sensible and not general displacements. It was therefore necessary, in order to submit these grand phenomena to calculation, to discover the mathematical laws of the propagation of heat in the interior of masses.

19. It will be perceived, on reading this work, that heat attains in bodies a regular disposition independent of the original distribution, which may be regarded as arbitrary.

In whatever manner the heat was at first distributed, the system of temperatures, altering more and more, tends to coincide sensibly with a definite state which depends only on the form of the solid. In the ultimate state, the temperatures of all the points are lowered in the same time, but preserve amongst each other the same ratios: in order to express this property, the analytical formulae contain terms composed of exponentials and of quantities analogous to trigonometric functions.

Several problems of mechanics present analogous results, such as the isochronism of oscillations, the multiple resonance of sonorous bodies. Common experiments had made these results remarked, and analysis afterwards demonstrated their true cause. As to those results which depend on changes of temperature, they could not have been recognized except by very exact experiments; but mathematical analysis has outrun observation; it has supplemented our senses and has made us in a manner witnesses of regular and harmonic vibrations in the interior of bodies.

20. These considerations present a singular example of the relations which exist between the abstract science of numbers and natural causes.

When a metal bar is exposed at one end to the constant action of a source of heat, and every point of it has attained its highest temperature, the system of fixed temperatures corresponds exactly to a table of logarithms; the numbers are the elevations of thermometers placed at the different points, and the logarithms are the distances of these points from the source. In general, heat distributes itself in the interior of solids according to a simple law expressed by a partial differential equation common to physical problems of different order. The irradiation of heat has an evident relation to the tables of sines, for the rays which depart from the same point of a heated surface differ very much from each other, and their intensity is rigorously proportional to the sine of the angle which the direction of each ray makes with the element of surface.

If we could observe the changes of temperature for every instant at every point of a solid homogeneous mass, we should discover in these series of observations the properties of recurring series, as of sines and logarithms; they would be noticed, for example, in the diurnal or annual variations of temperature of different points of the earth near its surface.

We should recognize again the same results and all the chief elements of general analysis in the vibrations of elastic media, in the properties of lines or of curved surfaces, in the movements of the stars, and those of light or of fluids. Thus the functions obtained by successive differentiations, which are employed in the development of infinite series and in the solution of numerical equations, correspond also to physical properties. The first of these functions, or the fluxion properly so called, expresses in geometry the inclination of the tangent of a curved line, and in dynamics the velocity of a moving body when the motion varies; in the theory of heat it measures the quantity of heat which flows at each point of a body across a given surface. Mathematical analysis has therefore necessary relations with sensible phenomena; its object is not created by human intelligence; it is a pre-existent element of the universal order and is not in any way contingent or fortuitous; it is imprinted throughout all nature.

21. Observations more exact and more varied will presently ascertain whether the effects of heat are modified by causes which have not yet been perceived, and the theory will acquire fresh perfection by the continued comparison of its results with the results of experiment; it will explain some important phenomena which we have not yet been able to submit to calculation; it will show how to determine all the thermometric effects of the solar rays, the fixed or variable temperature which would be observed at different distances from the equator, whether in the interior of the earth or beyond the limits of the atmosphere, whether in the ocean or in different regions of the air. From it will be derived the mathematical knowledge of the great movements which result from the influence of heat combined with that of gravity. The same principles will serve to measure the conductivities, proper or relative, of different bodies, and their specific capacities, to distinguish all the causes which modify the emission of heat at the surface of solids, and to perfect thermometric instruments.

The theory of heat will always attract the attention of mathematicians, by the rigorous exactness of its elements and the analytical difficulties peculiar to it, and above all by the extent and usefulness of its applications; for all its consequences concern at the same time general physics, the operations of the arts, domestic uses and civil economy.

## SECTION II. Preliminary Definitions and General Notions

22. Of the nature of heat, uncertain hypotheses only could be formed, but the knowledge of the mathematical laws to which its effects are subject is independent of all hypothesis; it requires only an attentive examination of the chief facts which common observations have indicated and which have been confirmed by exact experiments.

It is necessary, then, to set forth, in the first place, the general results of observation, to give exact definitions of all the elements of the analysis, and to establish the principles upon which this analysis ought to be founded.

The action of heat tends to expand all bodies—solid, liquid, or gaseous; this is the property which gives evidence of its presence. Solids and liquids increase in volume, in most cases, if the quantity of heat which they contain increases; they contract if it diminishes.

When all the parts of a solid homogeneous body, for example those of a mass of metal, are equally heated and preserve without any change the same quantity of heat, they have also and retain the same density. This state is expressed by saying that throughout the whole extent of the mass, the molecules have a common and permanent temperature.

23. The thermometer is a body whose smallest changes of volume can be appreciated; it serves to measure temperatures by the dilatation of a fluid or of air. We assume the construction, use, and properties of this instrument to be accurately known. The temperature of a body equally heated in every part and which keeps its heat, is that which the thermometer indicates when it is and remains in perfect contact with the body in question.

Perfect contact is when the thermometer is completely immersed in a fluid mass, and, in general, when there is no point of the external surface of the instrument which is not touched by one of the points of the solid or liquid mass whose temperature is to be measured. In experiments, it is not always necessary that this condition should be rigorously observed; but it ought to be assumed in order to make the definition exact.

24. Two fixed temperatures are determined on, namely: the temperature of melting ice, which is denoted by 0, and the temperature of boiling water, which we will denote by 1. The water is supposed to be boiling under an atmospheric pressure represented by a certain height of the barometer (76 centimetres), the mercury of the barometer being at the temperature 0.

25. Different quantities of heat are measured by determining how many times they contain a fixed quantity which is taken as the unit. Suppose a mass of ice having a definite weight (a kilogramme) to be at temperature 0 and to be converted into water at the same temperature 0 by the addition of a certain quantity of heat: the quantity of heat thus added is taken as the unit of measure. Hence the quantity of heat expressed by a number C contains C times the quantity required to melt a kilogramme of ice at the temperature zero into a mass of water at the same zero temperature.

26. To raise a metallic mass having a certain weight—a kilogramme of iron, for example—from the temperature 0 to the temperature 1, a new quantity of heat must be added to that which is already contained in the mass. The number C which denotes this additional quantity of heat is the specific capacity of iron for heat; the number C has very different values for different substances.

27. If a body of definite nature and weight (a kilogramme of mercury) occupies a volume V at temperature 0, it will occupy a greater volume V+A when it has acquired the temperature 1, that is to say, when the heat which it contained at the temperature 0 has been increased by a new quantity C, equal to the specific capacity of the body for heat. But if, instead of adding this quantity C, a quantity zC is added (z being a number, positive or negative), the new volume will be V+δ instead of V+A. Now experiments show that if z is equal to the increase of volume, δ is only half the total increment A, and that in general the value of δ is zA when the quantity of heat added is zC.

28. The ratio z of the two quantities zC and C of heat added, which is the same as the ratio of the two increments of volume δ and A, is that which is called the temperature; hence the quantity which expresses the actual temperature of a body represents the excess of its actual volume over the volume which it would occupy at the temperature of melting ice, unity representing the whole excess of volume which corresponds to the boiling point of water, over the volume which corresponds to the melting point of ice.

29. The increments of volume of bodies are in general proportional to the increments of the quantities of heat which produce the dilatations, but it must be remarked that this proportion is exact only in the case where the bodies in question are subjected to temperatures remote from those which determine their change of state. The application of these results to all liquids must not be relied on; and with respect to water in particular, dilatations do not always follow augmentations of heat.

In general, the temperatures are numbers proportional to the quantities of heat added, and in the cases considered by us, these numbers are proportional also to the increments of volume.

30. Suppose that a body bounded by a plane surface having a certain area (a square metre) is maintained in any manner whatever at constant temperature 1, common to all its points, and that the surface in question is in contact with air maintained at temperature 0: the heat which escapes continuously at the surface and passes into the surrounding medium will be replaced always by the heat which proceeds from the constant cause to whose action the body is exposed; thus, a certain quantity of heat denoted by h will flow through the surface in a definite time (a minute).

This amount h, of a flow continuous and always similar to itself, which takes place at a unit of surface at a fixed temperature, is the measure of the external conducibility of the body, that is to say, of the facility with which its surface transmits heat to the atmospheric air.

The air is supposed to be continually displaced with a given uniform velocity; but if the velocity of the current increased, the quantity of heat communicated to the medium would vary also; the same would happen if the density of the medium were increased.

31. If the excess of the constant temperature of the body over the temperature of surrounding bodies, instead of being equal to 1, as has been supposed, had a less value, the quantity of heat dissipated would be less than h. The result of observation is, as we shall see presently, that this quantity of heat lost may be regarded as sensibly proportional to the excess of the temperature of the body over that of the air and surrounding bodies. Hence the quantity h having been determined by one experiment in which the surface heated is at temperature 1 and the medium at temperature 0, we conclude that hz would be the quantity if the temperature of the surface were z, all the other circumstances remaining the same. This result must be admitted when z is a small fraction.

32. The value h of the quantity of heat which is dispersed across a heated surface is different for different bodies, and it varies for the same body according to the different states of the surface. The effect of irradiation diminishes as the surface becomes more polished, so that by destroying the polish of the surface the value of h is considerably increased. A heated metallic body will be more quickly cooled if its external surface is covered with a black coating such as will entirely tarnish its metallic lustre.

33. The rays of heat which escape from the surface of a body pass freely through spaces void of air; they are propagated also in atmospheric air; their directions are not disturbed by agitations in the intervening air; they can be reflected by metal mirrors and collected at their foci. Bodies at a high temperature, when plunged into a liquid, heat directly only those parts of the mass with which their surface is in contact. The molecules whose distance from this surface is not extremely small receive no direct heat; it is not the same with aeriform fluids; in these, the rays of heat are borne with extreme rapidity to considerable distances, whether it be that part of these rays traverses freely the layers of air, or whether these layers transmit the rays suddenly without altering their direction.

34. When the heated body is placed in air which is maintained at a sensibly constant temperature, the heat communicated to the air makes the layer of the fluid nearest to the surface of the body lighter; this layer rises more quickly the more intensely it is heated and is replaced by another mass of cool air. A current is thus established in the air whose direction is vertical and whose velocity is greater as the temperature of the body is higher. For this reason, if the body cooled itself gradually, the velocity of the current would diminish with the temperature, and the law of cooling would not be exactly the same as if the body were exposed to a current of air at a constant velocity.

35. When bodies are sufficiently heated to diffuse a vivid light, part of their radiant heat mixed with that light can traverse transparent solids or liquids and is subject to the force which produces refraction. The quantity of heat which possesses this faculty becomes less as the bodies are less inflamed; it is, we may say, insensible for very opaque bodies, however highly they may be heated. A thin transparent plate intercepts almost all the direct heat which proceeds from an ardent mass of metal; but it becomes heated in proportion as the intercepted rays are accumulated in it; whence, if it is formed of ice, it becomes liquid; but if this plate of ice is exposed to the rays of a torch, it allows a sensible amount of heat to pass through with the light.

36. We have taken as the measure of the external conductivity of a solid body a coefficient *h*, which denotes the quantity of heat which would pass, in a definite time (a minute), from the surface of this body, into atmospheric air, supposing that the surface had a definite extent (a square metre), that the constant temperature of the body was 1, and that of the air 0, and that the heated surface was exposed to a current of air of a given invariable velocity. This value of *h* is determined by observation. The quantity of heat expressed by the coefficient is composed of two distinct parts which cannot be measured except by very exact experiments. One is the heat communicated by way of contact to the surrounding air: the other, much less than the first, is the radiant heat emitted. We must assume, in our first investigations, that the quantity of heat lost does not change when the temperatures of the body and of the medium are augmented by the same sufficiently small quantity.

37. Solid substances differ again, as we have already remarked, by their property of being more or less permeable to heat; this quality is their conductivity proper: we shall give its definition and exact measure, after having treated of the uniform and linear propagation of heat. Liquid substances possess also the property of transmitting heat from molecule to molecule, and the numerical value of their conductivity varies according to the nature of the substances: but this effect is observed with difficulty in liquids, since their molecules change places on change of temperature. The propagation of heat in them depends chiefly on this continual displacement, in all cases where the lower parts of the mass are most exposed to the action of the source of heat. If, on the contrary, the source of heat be applied to that part of the mass which is highest, as was the case in several of our experiments, the transfer of heat, which is very slow, does not produce any displacement, at least when the increase of temperature does not diminish the volume, as is indeed noticed in singular cases bordering on changes of state.

38. To this explanation of the chief results of observation, a general remark must be added on equilibrium of temperatures; which consists in this, that different bodies placed in the same region, all of whose parts are and remain equally heated, acquire also a common and permanent temperature.

Suppose that all the parts of a mass *M* have a common and constant temperature *a*, which is maintained by any cause whatever: if a smaller body *m* be placed in perfect contact with the mass *M*, it will assume the common temperature *a*.

In reality this result would not strictly occur except after an infinite time: but the exact meaning of the proposition is that if the body *m* had the temperature *a* before being placed in contact, it would keep it without any change. The same would be the case with a multitude of other bodies *n*, *p*, *q*, *r* each of which was placed separately in perfect contact with the mass *M*: all would acquire the constant temperature *a*. Thus a thermometer if successively applied to the different bodies *m*, *n*, *p*, *q*, *r* would indicate the same temperature.

39. The effect in question is independent of contact, and would still occur, if every part of the body *m* were enclosed in the solid *M*, as in an enclosure, without touching any of its parts. For example, if the solid were a spherical envelope of a certain thickness, maintained by some external cause at a temperature *a*, and containing a space entirely deprived of air, and if the body *m* could be placed in any part whatever of this spherical space, without touching any point of the internal surface of the enclosure, it would acquire the common temperature *a*, or rather, it would preserve it if it had it already. The result would be the same for all the other bodies *n*, *p*, *q*, *r*, whether they were placed separately or all together in the same enclosure, and whatever also their substance and form might be.

40. Of all modes of presenting to ourselves the action of heat, that which seems simplest and most conformable to observation, consists in comparing this action to that of light. Molecules separated from one another reciprocally communicate, across empty space, their rays of heat, just as shining bodies transmit their light.

If within an enclosure closed in all directions, and maintained by some external cause at a fixed temperature *a*, we suppose different bodies to be placed without touching any part of the boundary, different effects will be observed according as the bodies, introduced into this space free from air, are more or less heated. If, in the first instance, we insert only one of these bodies, at the same temperature as the enclosure, it will send from all points of its surface as much heat as it receives from the solid which surrounds it, and is maintained in its original state by this exchange of equal quantities.

If we insert a second body whose temperature *b* is less than *a*, it will at first receive from the surfaces which surround it on all sides without touching it, a quantity of heat greater than that which it gives out: it will be heated more and more and will absorb through its surface more heat than in the first instance.

The initial temperature *b* continually rising, will approach without ceasing the fixed temperature *a*, so that after a certain time the difference will be almost insensible. The effect would be opposite if we placed within the same enclosure a third body whose temperature was greater than *a*.

41. All bodies have the property of emitting heat through their surface; the hotter they are the more they emit; the intensity of the emitted rays changes very considerably with the state of the surface.

42. Every surface which receives rays of heat from surrounding bodies reflects part and admits the rest: the heat which is not reflected, but introduced through the surface, accumulates within the solid; and so long as it exceeds the quantity dissipated by irradiation, the temperature rises.

43. The rays which tend to go out of heated bodies are arrested at the surface by a force which reflects part of them into the interior of the mass. The cause which hinders the incident rays from traversing the surface, and which divides these rays into two parts, of which one is reflected and the other admitted, acts in the same manner on the rays which are directed from the interior of the body towards external space.

If by modifying the state of the surface we increase the force by which it reflects the incident rays, we increase at the same time the power which it has of reflecting towards the interior of the body rays which are tending to go out. The incident rays introduced into the mass, and the rays emitted through the surface, are equally diminished in quantity.

44. If within the enclosure above mentioned a number of bodies were placed at the same time, separate from each other and unequally heated, they would receive and transmit rays of heat so that at each exchange their temperatures would continually vary, and would all tend to become equal to the fixed temperature of the enclosure.

This effect is precisely the same as that which occurs when heat is propagated within solid bodies; for the molecules which compose these bodies are separated by spaces void of air, and have the property of receiving, accumulating and emitting heat. Each of them sends out rays on all sides, and at the same time receives other rays from the molecules which surround it.

45. The heat given out by a point situated in the interior of a solid mass can pass directly to an extremely small distance only; it is, we may say, intercepted by the nearest particles; these particles only receive the heat directly and act on more distant points. It is different with gaseous fluids; the direct effects of radiation become sensible in them at very considerable distances.

46. Thus the heat which escapes in all directions from a part of the surface of a solid, passes on in air to very distant points; but is emitted only by those molecules of the body which are extremely near the surface. A point of a heated mass situated at a very small distance from the plane superficies which separates the mass from external space, sends to that space an infinity of rays, but they do not all arrive there; they are diminished by all that quantity of heat which is arrested by the intermediate molecules of the solid. The part of the ray actually dispersed into space becomes less according as it traverses a longer path within the mass. Thus the ray which escapes perpendicular to the surface has greater intensity than that which, departing from the same point, follows an oblique direction, and the most oblique rays are wholly intercepted.

The same consequences apply to all the points which are near enough to the surface to take part in the emission of heat, from which it necessarily follows that the whole quantity of heat which escapes from the surface in the normal direction is very much greater than that whose direction is oblique. We have submitted this question to calculation, and our analysis proves that the intensity of the ray is proportional to the sine of the angle which the ray makes with the element of surface. Experiments had already indicated a similar result.

47. This theorem expresses a general law which has a necessary connection with the equilibrium and mode of action of heat. If the rays which escape from a heated surface had the same intensity in all directions, a thermometer placed at one of the points of a space bounded on all sides by an enclosure maintained at a constant temperature would indicate a temperature incomparably greater than that of the enclosure. Bodies placed within this enclosure would not take a common temperature, as is always noticed; the temperature acquired by them would depend on the place which they occupied, or on their form, or on the forms of neighbouring bodies.

The same results would be observed, or other effects equally opposed to common experience, if between the rays which escape from the same point any other relations were admitted different from those which we have enunciated. We have recognised this law as the only one compatible with the general fact of the equilibrium of radiant heat.

48. If a space free from air is bounded on all sides by a solid enclosure whose parts are maintained at a common and constant temperature *a*, and if a thermometer, having the actual temperature *a*, is placed at any point whatever of the space, its temperature will continue without any change. It will receive therefore at each instant from the inner surface of the enclosure as much heat as it gives out to it. This effect of the rays of heat in a given space is, properly speaking, the measure of the temperature: but this consideration presupposes the mathematical theory of radiant heat.

If now between the thermometer and a part of the surface of the enclosure a body *M* be placed whose temperature is *a*, the thermometer will cease to receive rays from one part of the inner surface, but the rays will be replaced by those which it will receive from the interposed body *M*. An easy calculation proves that the compensation is exact, so that the state of the thermometer will be unchanged. It is not the same if the temperature of the body *M* is different from that of the enclosure. When it is greater, the rays which the interposed body *M* sends to the thermometer and which replace the intercepted rays convey more heat than the latter; the temperature of the thermometer must therefore rise.

If, on the contrary, the intervening body has a temperature less than *a*, that of the thermometer must fall; for the rays which this body intercepts are replaced by those which it gives out, that is to say, by rays cooler than those of the enclosure; thus the thermometer does not receive all the heat necessary to maintain its temperature *a*.

49. Up to this point abstraction has been made of the power which all surfaces have of reflecting part of the rays which are sent to them. If this property were disregarded we should have only a very incomplete idea of the equilibrium of radiant heat.

Suppose then that on the inner surface of the enclosure, maintained at a constant temperature, there is a portion which enjoys, in a certain degree, the power in question; each point of the reflecting surface will send into space two kinds of rays; the one go out from the very interior of the substance of which the enclosure is formed, the others are merely reflected by the same surface against which they had been sent. But at the same time that the surface repels on the outside part of the incident rays, it retains in the inside part of its own rays. In this respect an exact compensation is established, that is to say, every one of its own rays which the surface hinders from going out is replaced by a reflected ray of equal intensity.

The same result would happen, if the power of reflecting rays affected in any degree whatever other parts of the enclosure, or the surface of bodies placed within the same space and already at the common temperature.

Thus the reflection of heat does not disturb the equilibrium of temperatures, and does not introduce, whilst that equilibrium exists, any change in the law according to which the intensity of rays which leave the same point decreases proportionally to the sine of the angle of emission.

50. Suppose that in the same enclosure, all of whose parts maintain the temperature *a*, we place an isolated body *M*, and a polished metal surface *R*, which, turning its concavity towards the body, reflects great part of the rays which it received from the body; if we place a thermometer between the body *M* and the reflecting surface *R*, at the focus of this mirror, three different effects will be observed according as the temperature of the body *M* is equal to the common temperature *a*, or is greater or less.

In the first case, the thermometer preserves the temperature *a*; it receives 1°, rays of heat from all parts of the enclosure not hidden from it by the body *M* or by the mirror; 2°, rays given out by the body; 3°, those which the surface *R* sends out to the focus, whether they come from the mass of the mirror itself, or whether its surface has simply reflected them; and amongst the last we may distinguish between those which have been sent to the mirror by the mass *M*, and those which it has received from the enclosure. All the rays in question proceed from surfaces which, by hypothesis, have a common temperature *a*, so that the thermometer is precisely in the same state as if the space bounded by the enclosure contained no other body but itself.

In the second case, the thermometer placed between the heated body *M* and the mirror, must acquire a temperature greater than *a*. In reality, it receives the same rays as in the first hypothesis; but with two remarkable differences: one arises from the fact that the rays sent by the body *M* to the mirror, and reflected upon the thermometer, contain more heat than in the first case. The other difference depends on the fact that the rays sent directly by the body *M* to the thermometer contain more heat than formerly. Both causes, and chiefly the first, assist in raising the temperature of the thermometer.

In the third case, that is to say, when the temperature of the mass *M* is less than *a*, the thermometer must assume also a temperature less than *a*. In fact, it receives again all the varieties of rays which we distinguished in the first case: but there are two kinds of them which contain less heat than in this first hypothesis, that is to say, those which, being sent out by the body *M*, are reflected by the mirror upon the thermometer, and those which the same body *M* sends to it directly. Thus the thermometer does not receive all the heat which it requires to preserve its original temperature *a*. It gives out more heat than it receives. It is inevitable then that its temperature must fall to the point at which the rays which it receives suffice to compensate those which it loses. This last effect is what is called the reflection of cold, and which, properly speaking, consists in the reflection of too feeble heat. The mirror intercepts a certain quantity of heat, and replaces it by a less quantity.

51. If in the enclosure, maintained at a constant temperature *a*, a body *M* be placed, whose temperature *a'* is less than *a*, the presence of this body will lower the thermometer exposed to its rays, and we may remark that the rays sent to the thermometer from the surface of the body *M*, are in general of two kinds, namely, those which come from inside the mass *M*, and those which, coming from different parts of the enclosure, meet the surface *M* and are reflected upon the thermometer. The latter rays have the common temperature *a*, but those which belong to the body *M* contain less heat, and these are the rays which cool the thermometer. If now, by changing the state of the surface of the body *M*, for example, by destroying the polish, we diminish the power which it has of reflecting the incident rays, the thermometer will fall still lower, and will assume a temperature *a''* less than *a'*. In fact all the conditions would be the same as in the preceding case, if it were not that the body *M* gives out a greater quantity of its own rays and reflects a less quantity of the rays which it receives from the enclosure; that is to say, these last rays, which have the common temperature, are in part replaced by cooler rays. Hence the thermometer no longer receives so much heat as formerly.

If, independently of the change in the surface of the body *M*, we place a metal mirror adapted to reflect upon the thermometer the rays which have left *M*, the temperature will assume a value *a'''* less than *a''*. The mirror, in fact, intercepts from the thermometer part of the rays of the enclosure which all have the temperature *a*, and replaces them by three kinds of rays; namely, 1°, those which come from the interior of the mirror itself, and which have the common temperature; 2°, those which the different parts of the enclosure send to the mirror with the same temperature, and which are reflected to the focus; 3°, those which, coming from the interior of the body *M*, fall upon the mirror, and are reflected upon the thermometer. The last rays have a temperature less than *a*; hence the thermometer no longer receives so much heat as it received before the mirror was set up.

Lastly, if we proceed to change also the state of the surface of the mirror, and by giving it a more perfect polish, increase its power of reflecting heat, the thermometer will fall still lower. In fact, all the conditions exist which occurred in the preceding case. Only, it happens that the mirror gives out a less quantity of its own rays, and replaces them by those which it reflects. Now, amongst these last rays, all those which proceed from the interior of the mass *M* are less intense than if they had come from the interior of the metal mirror; hence the thermometer receives still less heat than formerly: it will assume therefore a temperature *a''''* less than *a'''*.

By the same principles all the known facts of the radiation of heat or of cold are easily explained.

52. The effects of heat can by no means be compared with those of an elastic fluid whose molecules are at rest.

It would be useless to attempt to deduce from this hypothesis the laws of propagation which we have explained in this work, and which all experience has confirmed. The free state of heat is the same as that of light; the active state of this element is then entirely different from that of gaseous substances. Heat acts in the same manner in a vacuum, in elastic fluids, and in liquid or solid masses, it is propagated only by way of radiation, but its sensible effects differ according to the nature of bodies.

53. Heat is the origin of all elasticity; it is the repulsive force which preserves the form of solid masses, and the volume of liquids. In solid masses, neighbouring molecules would yield to their mutual attraction, if its effect were not destroyed by the heat which separates them.

This elastic force is greater according as the temperature is higher; which is the reason why bodies dilate or contract when their temperature is raised or lowered.

54. The equilibrium which exists, in the interior of a solid mass, between the repulsive force of heat and the molecular attraction, is stable; that is to say, it re-establishes itself when disturbed by an accidental cause. If the molecules are arranged at distances proper for equilibrium, and if an external force begins to increase this distance without any change of temperature, the effect of attraction begins by surpassing that of heat, and brings back the molecules to their original position, after a multitude of oscillations which become less and less sensible.

A similar effect is exerted in the opposite sense when a mechanical cause diminishes the primitive distance of the molecules; such is the origin of the vibrations of sonorous or flexible bodies, and of all the effects of their elasticity.

55. In the liquid or gaseous state of matter, the external pressure is additional or supplementary to the molecular attraction, and, acting on the surface, does not oppose change of form, but only change of the volume occupied. Analytical investigation will best show how the repulsive force of heat, opposed to the attraction of the molecules or to the external pressure, assists in the composition of bodies, solid or liquid, formed of one or more elements, and determines the elastic properties of gaseous fluids; but these researches do not belong to the object before us, and appear in dynamic theories.

56. It cannot be doubted that the mode of action of heat always consists, like that of light, in the reciprocal communication of rays, and this explanation is at the present time adopted by the majority of physicists; but it is not necessary to consider the phenomena under this aspect in order to establish the theory of heat. In the course of this work it will be seen how the laws of equilibrium and propagation of radiant heat, in solid or liquid masses, can be rigorously demonstrated, independently of any physical explanation, as the necessary consequences of common observations.

## SECTION III. Principle of the Communication of Heat

57. We now proceed to examine what experiments teach us concerning the communication of heat.

If two equal molecules are formed of the same substance and have the same temperature, each of them receives from the other as much heat as it gives up to it; their mutual action may then be regarded as null, since the result of this action can bring about no change in the state of the molecules. If, on the contrary, the first is hotter than the second, it sends to it more heat than it receives from it; the result of the mutual action is the difference of these two quantities of heat. In all cases we make abstraction of the two equal quantities of heat which any two material points reciprocally give up; we conceive that the point most heated acts only on the other, and that, in virtue of this action, the first loses a certain quantity of heat which is acquired by the second. Thus the action of the two molecules, or the quantity of heat which the hottest communicates to the other, is the difference of the two quantities which they give up to each other.

58. Suppose that we place in air a solid homogeneous body, whose different points have unequal actual temperatures; each of the molecules of which the body is composed will begin to receive heat from those which are at extremely small distances, or will communicate it to them. This action exerted during the same instant between all points of the mass, will produce an infinitesimal resultant change in all the temperatures: the solid will experience at each instant similar effects, so that the variations of temperature will become more and more sensible.

Consider only the system of two molecules, *m* and *n*, equal and extremely near, and let us ascertain what quantity of heat the first can receive from the second during one instant: we may then apply the same reasoning to all the other points which are near enough to the point *m*, to act directly on it during the first instant.

The quantity of heat communicated by the point *n* to the point *m* depends on the duration of the instant, on the very small distance between these points, on the actual temperature of each point, and on the nature of the solid substance; that is to say, if one of these elements happened to vary, all the others remaining the same, the quantity of heat transmitted would vary also. Now experiments have disclosed, in this respect, a general result: it consists in this, that all the other circumstances being the same, the quantity of heat which one of the molecules receives from the other is proportional to the difference of temperature of the two molecules. Thus the quantity would be double, triple, quadruple, if everything else remaining the same, the difference of the temperature of the point *n* from that of the point *m* became double, triple, or quadruple. To account for this result, we must consider that the action of *n* on *m* is always just as much greater as there is a greater difference between the temperatures of the two points: it is null, if the temperatures are equal, but if the molecule *n* contains more heat than the equal molecule *m*, that is to say, if the temperature of *m* being *v*, that of *n* is *v*+Δ, a portion of the exceeding heat will pass from *n* to *m*. Now, if the excess of heat were double, or, which is the same thing, if the temperature of *n* were *v*+2Δ, the exceeding heat would be composed of two equal parts corresponding to the two halves of the whole difference of temperature 2Δ; each of these parts would have its proper effect as if it alone existed: thus the quantity of heat communicated by *n* to *m* would be twice as great as when the difference of temperature is only Δ. This simultaneous action of the different parts of the exceeding heat is that which constitutes the principle of the communication of heat. It follows from it that the sum of the partial actions, or the total quantity of heat which *m* receives from *n* is proportional to the difference of the two temperatures.

59. Denoting by *v* and *v'* the temperatures of two equal molecules *m* and *n*, by *p* their extremely small distance, and by *dt*, the infinitely small duration of the instant, the quantity of heat which *m* receives from *n* during this instant will be expressed by (*v'* - *v*)φ(*p*) *dt*. We denote by φ(*p*) a certain function of the distance *p* which, in solid bodies and in liquids, becomes nothing when *p* has a sensible magnitude. The function is the same for every point of the same given substance; it varies with the nature of the substance.

## SECTION III

60. The quantity of heat which bodies lose through their surface is subject to the same principle. If we denote by a the area, finite or infinitely small, of the surface, all of whose points have the temperature v, and if b represents the temperature of the atmospheric air, the coefficient h being the measure of the external conducibility, we shall have ah(v − b) dt as the expression for the quantity of heat which this surface a transmits to the air during the instant dt.

When the two molecules, one of which transmits to the other a certain quantity of heat, belong to the same solid, the exact expression for the heat communicated is that which we have given in the preceding article; and since the molecules are extremely near, the difference of the temperatures is extremely small. It is not the same when heat passes from a solid body into a gaseous medium. But the experiments teach us that if the difference is a quantity sufficiently small, the heat transmitted is sensibly proportional to that difference, and that the number h may, in these first researches, be considered as having a constant value, proper to each state of the surface, but independent of the temperature.

61. These propositions relative to the quantity of heat communicated have been derived from different observations. We see first, as an evident consequence of the expressions in question, that if we increased by a common quantity all the initial temperatures of the solid mass, and that of the medium in which it is placed, the successive changes of temperature would be exactly the same as if this increase had not been made. Now this result is sensibly in accordance with experiment; it has been admitted by the physicists who first observed the effects of heat.

62. If the medium is maintained at a constant temperature, and if the heated body which is placed in that medium has dimensions sufficiently small for the temperature, whilst falling more and more, to remain sensibly the same at all points of the body, it follows from the same propositions, that a quantity of heat will escape at each instant through the surface of the body proportional to the excess of its actual temperature over that of the medium. Whence it is easy to conclude, as will be seen in the course of this work, that the line whose abscissae represent the times elapsed, and whose ordinates represent the temperatures corresponding to those times, is a logarithmic curve: now, observations also furnish the same result, when the excess of the temperature of the solid over that of the medium is a sufficiently small quantity.

63. Suppose the medium to be maintained at the constant temperature 0, and that the initial temperatures of different points a, b, c, d, &c., of the same mass are a, β, γ, δ, &c., that at the end of the first instant they have become a′, β′, γ′, δ′, &c., that at the end of the second instant they have become a″, β″, γ″, δ″, &c., and so on. We may easily conclude from the propositions enunciated, that if the initial temperatures of the same points had been ga, gβ, gγ, gδ, &c. (g being any number whatever), they would have become, at the end of the first instant, by virtue of the action of the different points, ga′, gβ′, gγ′, gδ′, &c., and at the end of the second instant, ga″, gβ″, gγ″, gδ″, &c., and so on.

For instance, let us compare the case when the initial temperatures of the points a, b, c, d, &c. were a, β, γ, δ, &c. with that in which they are 2a, 2β, 2γ, 2δ, &c., the medium preserving in both cases the temperature 0. In the second hypothesis, the difference of the temperatures of any two points whatever is double what it was in the first, and the excess of the temperature of each point, over that of each molecule of the medium, is also double; consequently the quantity of heat which any molecule whatever sends to any other, or that which it receives, is, in the second hypothesis, double of that which it was in the first. The change of temperature which each point suffers being proportional to the quantity of heat acquired, it follows that, in the second case, this change is double what it was in the first case. Now we have supposed that the initial temperature of the first point, which was a, became a′ at the end of the first instant; hence if this initial temperature had been 2a, and if all the other temperatures had been doubled, it would have become 2a′. The same would be the case with all the other molecules b, c, d, and a similar result would be derived, if the ratio instead of being 2, were any number whatever g. It follows then, from the principle of the communication of heat, that if we increase or diminish in any given ratio all the initial temperatures, we increase or diminish in the same ratio all the successive temperatures.

This, like the two preceding results, is confirmed by observation. It could not have existed if the quantity of heat which passes from one molecule to another had not been, actually, proportional to the difference of the temperatures.

64. Observations have been made with accurate instruments, on the permanent temperatures at different points of a bar or of a metallic ring, and on the propagation of heat in the same bodies and in several other solids of the form of spheres or cubes. The results of these experiments agree with those which are derived from the preceding propositions. They would be entirely different if the quantity of heat transmitted from one solid molecule to another, or to a molecule of air, were not proportional to the excess of temperature. It is necessary first to know all the rigorous consequences of this proposition; by it we determine the chief part of the quantities which are the object of the problem. By comparing then the calculated values with those given by numerous and very exact experiments, we can easily measure the variations of the coefficients, and perfect our first researches.

## SECTION IV. On the Uniform and Linear Movement of Heat

65. We shall consider, in the first place, the uniform movement of heat in the simplest case, which is that of an infinite solid enclosed between two parallel planes.

We suppose a solid body formed of some homogeneous substance to be enclosed between two parallel and infinite planes; the lower plane A is maintained, by any cause whatever, at a constant temperature a; we may imagine for example that the mass is prolonged, and that the plane A is a section common to the solid and to the enclosed mass, and is heated at all its points by a constant source of heat; the upper plane B is also maintained by a similar cause at a fixed temperature b, whose value is less than that of a; the problem is to determine what would be the result of this hypothesis if it were continued for an infinite time.

If we suppose the initial temperature of all parts of this body to be b, it is evident that the heat which leaves the source A will be propagated farther and farther and will raise the temperature of the molecules included between the two planes: but the temperature of the upper plane being unable, according to hypothesis, to rise above b, the heat will be dispersed within the cooler mass, contact with which keeps the plane B at the constant temperature b. The system of temperatures will tend more and more to a final state, which it will never attain, but which would have the property, as we shall proceed to show, of existing and keeping itself up without any change if it were once formed.

In the final and fixed state, which we are considering, the permanent temperature of a point of the solid is evidently the same at all points of the same section parallel to the base; and we shall prove that this fixed temperature, common to all the points of an intermediate section, decreases in arithmetic progression from the base to the upper plane; that is to say, if we represent the constant temperatures a and b by the ordinates Aa and Bp (see Fig. 1), raised perpendicularly to the distance AB between the two planes, the fixed temperatures of the intermediate layers will be represented by the ordinates of the straight line ap which joins the extremities a and p; thus, denoting by z the height of an intermediate section or its perpendicular distance from the plane A, by e the whole height or distance AB, and by v the temperature of the section whose height is z, we must have the equation

v = a + ((b − a)/e) z.

In fact, if the temperatures were at first established in accordance with this law, and if the extreme surfaces A and B were always kept at the temperatures a and b, no change would happen in the state of the solid. To convince ourselves of this, it will be sufficient to compare the quantity of heat which would traverse an intermediate section A′ with that which, during the same time, would traverse another section B′.

Bearing in mind that the final state of the solid is formed and continues, we see that the part of the mass which is below the plane A′ must communicate heat to the part which is above that plane, since this second part is cooler than the first.

Imagine two points of the solid, m and m′, very near to each other, and placed in any manner whatever, the one m below the plane A′, and the other m′ above this plane, to be exerting their action during an infinitely small instant: m, the hotter point, will communicate to m′ a certain quantity of heat which will cross the plane A′. Let x, y, z be the rectangular coordinates of the point m, and x′, y′, z′ the coordinates of the point m′: consider also two other points n and n′ very near to each other, and situated with respect to the plane B′ in the same manner in which m and m′ are placed with respect to the plane A′: that is to say, denoting by f the perpendicular distance of the two sections A′ and B′, the coordinates of the point n will be x, y, z + f and those of the point n′, x′, y′, z′ + f; the two distances mm′ and nn′ will be equal; further, the difference of the temperature v of the point m above the temperature v′ of the point m′ will be the same as the difference of temperature of the two points n and n′. In fact the former difference will be determined by substituting first z and then z′ in the general equation

v = a + ((b − a)/e) z,

and subtracting the second equation from the first, whence the result v − v′ = ((b − a)/e) (z − z′). We shall then find, by the substitution of z + f and z′ + f, that the excess of temperature of the point n over that of the point n′ is also expressed by

v − v′ = ((b − a)/e) (z − z′).

It follows from this that the quantity of heat sent by the point m to the point m′ will be the same as the quantity of heat sent by the point n to the point n′, for all the elements which concur in determining this quantity of transmitted heat are the same.

It is manifest that we can apply the same reasoning to every system of two molecules which communicate heat to each other across the section A′ or the section B′; whence, if we could sum up the whole quantity of heat which flows, during the same instant, across the section A′ or the section B′, we should find this quantity to be the same for both sections.

From this it follows that the part of the solid included between A′ and B′ receives always as much heat as it loses, and since this result is applicable to any portion whatever of the mass included between two parallel sections, it is evident that no part of the solid can acquire a temperature higher than that which it has at present. Thus, it has been rigorously demonstrated that the state of the prism will continue to exist just as it was at first.

Hence, the permanent temperatures of different sections of a solid enclosed between two parallel infinite planes are represented by the ordinates of a straight line ap, and satisfy the linear equation

v = a + ((b − a)/e) z.

66. By what precedes we see distinctly what constitutes the propagation of heat in a solid enclosed between two parallel and infinite planes, each of which is maintained at a constant temperature. Heat penetrates the mass gradually across the lower plane: the temperatures of the intermediate sections are raised, but can never exceed nor even quite attain a certain limit which they approach nearer and nearer: this limit or final temperature is different for different intermediate layers, and decreases in arithmetic progression from the fixed temperature of the lower plane to the fixed temperature of the upper plane.

The final temperatures are those which would have to be given to the solid in order that its state might be permanent; the variable state which precedes it may also be submitted to analysis, as we shall see presently: but we are now considering only the system of final and permanent temperatures. In the last state, during each division of time, across a section parallel to the base, or a definite portion of that section, a certain quantity of heat flows, which is constant if the divisions of time are equal. This uniform flow is the same for all the intermediate sections; it is equal to that which proceeds from the source, and to that which is lost during the same time, at the upper surface of the solid, by virtue of the cause which keeps the temperature constant.

67. The problem now is to measure that quantity of heat which is propagated uniformly within the solid, during a given time, across a definite part of a section parallel to the base: it depends, as we shall see, on the two extreme temperatures a and b, and on the distance e between the two sides of the solid; it would vary if any one of these elements began to change, the other remaining the same. Suppose a second solid to be formed of the same substance as the first, and enclosed between two infinite parallel planes, whose perpendicular distance is e′ (see Fig. 2): the lower side is maintained at a fixed temperature a′, and the upper side at the fixed temperature b′; both solids are considered to be in that final and permanent state which has the property of maintaining itself as soon as it has been formed. Thus the law of the temperatures is expressed for the first body by the equation

v = a + ((b − a)/e) z,

and for the second, by the equation

u = a′ + ((b′ − a′)/e′) z,

v in the first solid, and u in the second, being the temperature of the section whose height is z.

This arranged, we will compare the quantity of heat which, during the unit of time, traverses a unit of area taken on an intermediate section L of the first solid, with that which during the same time traverses an equal area taken on the section L′ of the second, e being the height common to the two sections, that is to say, the distance of each of them from their own base. We shall consider two very near points n and n′ in the first body, one of which n is below the plane L and the other n′ above this plane: x, y, z are the coordinates of n: and x′, y′, z′ the coordinates of n′, e being less than z′ and greater than z.

We shall consider also in the second solid the instantaneous action of two points p and p′, which are situated, with respect to the section L′, in the same manner as the points n and n′ with respect to the section L of the first solid. Thus the same coordinates x, y, z, and x′, y′, z′, referred to three rectangular axes in the second body, will fix also the position of the points p and p′.

Now, the distance from the point n to the point n′ is equal to the distance from the point p to the point p′, and since the two bodies are formed of the same substance, we conclude, according to the principle of the communication of heat, that the action of n on n′, or the quantity of heat given by n to n′, and the action of p on p′, are to each other in the same ratio as the differences of the temperature v − v′ and u − u′.

Substituting v and then v′ in the equation which belongs to the first solid, and subtracting, we find v − v′ = ((b − a)/e) (z − z′); we have also by means of the second equation u − u′ = ((b′ − a′)/e′) (z − z′), whence the ratio of the two actions in question is that of ((b − a)/e) to ((b′ − a′)/e′).

We may now imagine many other systems of two molecules, the first of which sends to the second across the plane L a certain quantity of heat, and each of these systems, chosen in the first solid, may be compared with a homologous system situated in the second, and whose action is exerted across the section L′; we can then apply again the previous reasoning to prove that the ratio of the two actions is always that of ((b − a)/e) to ((b′ − a′)/e′).

Now, the whole quantity of heat which, during one instant, crosses the section L, results from the simultaneous action of a multitude of systems each of which is formed of two points; hence this quantity of heat and that which, in the second solid, crosses during the same instant the section L′, are also to each other in the ratio of ((b − a)/e) to ((b′ − a′)/e′).

It is easy then to compare with each other the intensities of the constant flows of heat which are propagated uniformly in the two solids, that is to say, the quantities of heat which, during unit of time, cross unit of surface of each of these bodies. The ratio of these intensities is that of the two quotients ((b − a)/e) and ((b′ − a′)/e′). If the two quotients are equal, the flows are the same, whatever in other respects the values a, b, e, a′, b′, e′ may be; in general, denoting the first flow by F and the second by F′, we shall have

F/F′ = ((b − a)/e) / ((b′ − a′)/e′).

68. Suppose that in the second solid, the permanent temperature a′ of the lower plane is that of boiling water, 1; that the temperature b′ of the upper plane is that of melting ice, 0; that the distance e′ of the two planes is the unit of measure (a metre); let us denote by K the constant flow of heat which, during unit of time (a minute) would cross unit of surface in this last solid, if it were formed of a given substance; K expressing a certain number of units of heat, that is to say a certain number of times the heat necessary to convert a kilogramme of ice into water: we shall have, in general, to determine the constant flow F, in a solid formed of the same substance, the equation

F = K ((a − b)/e).

The value of F denotes the quantity of heat which, during the unit of time, passes across a unit of area of the surface taken on a section parallel to the base.

Thus the thermometric state of a solid enclosed between two parallel infinite plane sides whose perpendicular distance is e, and which are maintained at fixed temperatures a and b, is represented by the two equations:

v = a + ((b − a)/e) z,

and

F = K ((a − b)/e).

The first of these equations expresses the law according to which the temperatures decrease from the lower side to the opposite side, the second indicates the quantity of heat which, during a given time, crosses a definite part of a section parallel to the base.

69. We have taken this coefficient K, which enters into the second equation, to be the measure of the specific conducibility of each substance; this number has very different values for different bodies.

It represents, in general, the quantity of heat which, in a homogeneous solid formed of a given substance and enclosed between two infinite parallel planes, flows, during one minute, across a surface of one square metre taken on a section parallel to the extreme planes, supposing that these two planes are maintained, one at the temperature of boiling water, the other at the temperature of melting ice, and that all the intermediate planes have acquired and retain a permanent temperature.

We might employ another definition of conductivity, since we could estimate the capacity for heat by referring it to unit of volume, instead of referring it to unit of mass. All these definitions are equally good provided they are clear and precise.

We shall show presently how to determine by observation the value K of the conductibility or conductibility in different substances.

70. In order to establish the equations which we have cited in Article 68, it would not be necessary to suppose the points which exert their action across the planes to be at extremely small distances.

The results would still be the same if the distances of these points had any magnitude whatever; they would therefore apply also to the case where the direct action of heat extended within the interior of the mass to very considerable distances, all the circumstances which constitute the hypothesis remaining in other respects the same.

We need only suppose that the cause which maintains the temperatures at the surface of the solid, affects not only that part of the mass which is extremely near to the surface, but that its action extends to a finite depth. The equation v = a + ((b − a)/e) z will still represent in this case the permanent temperatures of the solid. The true sense of this proposition is that, if we give to all points of the mass the temperatures expressed by the equation, and if besides any cause whatever, acting on the two extreme laminae, retained always every one of their molecules at the temperature which the same equation assigns to them, the interior points of the solid would preserve without any change their initial state.

If we supposed that the action of a point of the mass could extend to a finite distance e, it would be necessary that the thickness of the extreme laminae, whose state is maintained by the external cause, should be at least equal to e. But the quantity e having in fact, in the natural state of solids, only an inappreciable value, we may make abstraction of this thickness; and it is sufficient for the external cause to act on each of the two layers, extremely thin, which bound the solid. This is always what must be understood by the expression, to maintain the temperature of the surface constant.

71. We proceed further to examine the case in which the same solid would be exposed, at one of its faces, to atmospheric air maintained at a constant temperature.

Suppose then that the lower plane preserves the fixed temperature a, by virtue of any external cause whatever, and that the upper plane, instead of being maintained as formerly at a less temperature b, is exposed to atmospheric air maintained at that temperature b, the perpendicular distance of the two planes being denoted always by e: the problem is to determine the final temperatures.

Assuming that in the initial state of the solid, the common temperature of its molecules is b or less than b, we can readily imagine that the heat which proceeds incessantly from the source A penetrates the mass, and raises more and more the temperatures of the intermediate sections; the upper surface is gradually heated, and permits part of the heat which has penetrated the solid to escape into the air. The system of temperatures continually approaches a final state which would exist of itself if it were once formed; in this final state, which is that which we are considering, the temperature of the plane B has a fixed but unknown value, which we will denote by β, and since the lower plane A preserves also a permanent temperature a, the system of temperatures is represented by the general equation

v = a + ((β − a)/e) z,

v denoting always the fixed temperature of the section whose height is z. The quantity of heat which flows during unit of time across a unit of surface taken on any section whatever is

F = K ((a − β)/e),

K denoting the interior conducibility.

We must now consider that the upper surface B, whose temperature is β, permits the escape into the air of a certain quantity of heat which must be exactly equal to that which crosses any section whatever L of the solid. If it were not so, the part of the mass included between this section L and the plane B would not receive a quantity of heat equal to that which it loses; hence it would not maintain its state, which is contrary to hypothesis; the constant flow at the surface is therefore equal to that which traverses the solid: now, the quantity of heat which escapes, during unit of time, from unit of surface taken on the plane B, is expressed by h(β − b), b being the fixed temperature of the air, and h the measure of the conducibility of the surface B; we must therefore have the equation

K ((a − β)/e) = h(β − b),

from this may be derived

a − β = (e h (a − b)) / (e h + K),

an equation whose second member is known; for the temperatures a and b are given, as are also the quantities h, K, e.

Introducing this value of a − β into the general equation v = a + ((β − a)/e) z, we shall have, to express the temperatures of any section of the solid, the equation

v = a + ((β − a)/e) z,

in which known quantities only enter with the corresponding variables v and z.

72. So far we have determined the final and permanent state of the temperatures in a solid enclosed between two infinite and parallel plane surfaces, maintained at unequal temperatures. This first case is, properly speaking, the case of the linear and uniform propagation of heat, for there is no transfer of heat in the plane parallel to the sides of the solid; that which traverses the solid flows uniformly, since the value of the flow is the same for all instants and for all sections.

We will now restate the three chief propositions which result from the examination of this problem; they are susceptible of a great number of applications, and form the first elements of our theory.

1st. If at the two extremities of the thickness e of the solid we erect perpendiculars to represent the temperatures a and b of the two sides, and if we draw the straight line which joins the extremities of these two first ordinates, all the...

intermediate temperatures will be proportional to the ordinates of this straight
line; they are expressed by the general equation $a - v = z$, $v$ denoting the
temperature of the section whose height is $z$.

2nd. The quantity of heat which flows uniformly, during unit of time, across
unit of surface taken on any section whatever parallel to the sides, all other
things being equal, is directly proportional to the difference $a - b$ of the ex-
treme temperatures, and inversely proportional to the distance $e$ which
separates these sides. The quantity of heat is expressed by $K \frac{a-b}{e}$, or $K \frac{dv}{dz}$
if we derive from the general equation the value of $\frac{dv}{dz}$ which is constant; this
uniform flow may always be represented, for a given substance and in the solid
under examination, by the tangent of the angle included between the perpen-
dicular $e$ and the straight line whose ordinates represent the temperatures.

3rd. One of the extreme surfaces of the solid being submitted always to the
temperature $a$, if the other plane is exposed to air maintained at a fixed
temperature $b$; the plane in contact with the air acquires, as in the preceding
case, a fixed temperature $\beta$, greater than $b$, and it permits a quantity of heat
to escape into the air across unit of surface, during unit of time, which is
expressed by $h(\beta - b)$, $h$ denoting the external conducibility of the plane.
The same flow of heat $h(\beta - b)$ is equal to that which traverses the prism and
whose value is $K \frac{a - \beta}{e}$; we have therefore the equation $h(\beta - b) = K \frac{a - \beta}{e}$,
which gives the value of $\beta$.

## SECTION V. Law of the Permanent Temperatures in a Prism of Small Thickness

73. We shall easily apply the principles which have just been explained to the
following problem, very simple in itself, but one whose solution it is important
to base on exact theory.

A metal bar, whose form is that of a rectangular parallelepiped infinite in
length, is exposed to the action of a source of heat which produces a constant
temperature at all points of its extremity A. It is required to determine the
fixed temperatures at the different sections of the bar.

The section perpendicular to the axis is supposed to be a square whose side
$2l$ is so small that we may without sensible error consider the temperatures to
be equal at different points of the same section. The air in which the bar is
placed is maintained at a constant temperature $\theta$, and carried away by a
current with uniform velocity.

Inside the solid, heat will pass successively through all parts situated to the right or
left (*pro re nata*) of the source, and not exposed directly to its action; they
will be heated more and more, but the temperature of each point will not
increase beyond a certain limit. This maximum temperature is not the same
for every section; it in general decreases as the distance of the section from the
origin increases: we shall denote by $v$ the fixed temperature of a section per-
pendicular to the axis, and situated at a distance $x$ from the origin A.

Before every point of the solid has attained its highest degree of heat, the
system of temperatures varies continually, and approaches more and more to
a fixed state, which is that which we consider. This final state is kept up of
itself when it has once been formed. In order that the system of temperatures
may be permanent, it is necessary that the quantity of heat which, during unit
of time, crosses a section made at a distance $x$ from the origin, should balance
exactly all the heat which, during the same time, escapes through that part of
the external surface of the prism which is situated to the right of the same
section. The lamina whose thickness is $dx$, and whose external surface is $8ldx$,
allows the escape into the air, during unit of time, of a quantity of heat ex-
pressed by $8hlv dx$, $h$ being the measure of the external conducibility of the
prism. Hence taking the integral $\int 8hlv dx$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \infty$, we shall find
the quantity of heat which escapes from the whole surface of the bar during
unit of time; and if we take the same integral from $x = 0$ to $x = x$, we shall have
the quantity of heat lost through the part of the surface included between the
source of heat and the section made at the distance $x$. Denoting the first
integral by $C$, whose value is constant, and the variable value of the second by
$\int 8hlv dx$; the difference $C - \int 8hlv dx$ will express the whole quantity of heat
which escapes into the air across the part of the surface situated to the right of
the section. On the other hand, the lamina of the solid, enclosed between two
sections infinitely near at distances $x$ and $x+dx$, must resemble an infinite
solid, bounded by two parallel planes, subject to fixed temperatures $v$ and
$v+dv$; by hypothesis, the temperature does not vary throughout the whole
extent of the same section. The thickness of the solid is $dx$, and the area of the
section is $4l^2$: hence the quantity of heat which flows uniformly, during unit of
time, across a section of this solid, is, according to the preceding principles,
$-4l^2 K \frac{dv}{dx}$, $K$ being the specific internal conductivity: we must therefore have
the equation $-4l^2 K \frac{dv}{dx} = C - \int 8hlv dx$,
whence
$K \frac{d^2 v}{dx^2} = \frac{2h}{l} v$.

74. We should obtain the same result by considering the equilibrium of heat
in a single lamina infinitely thin, enclosed between two sections at distances
$x$ and $x+dx$. In fact, the quantity of heat which, during unit of time, crosses
the first section situated at distance $x$, is $-4l^2 K \frac{dv}{dx}$. To find that which flows dur-
ing the same time across the successive section situated at distance $x+dx$,
we must in the preceding expression change $x$ into $x+dx$, which gives
$-4l^2 K \left( \frac{dv}{dx} + \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right) dx \right)$.
If we subtract the second expression from the first we
shall find how much heat is acquired by the lamina bounded by these two sec-
tions during unit of time; and since the state of the lamina is permanent, it
follows that all the heat acquired is dispersed into the air across the external
surface $8ldx$ of the same lamina: now the last quantity of heat is $8hlv dx$: we
shall obtain therefore the same equation
$8hlv dx = -4l^2 K \frac{d^2 v}{dx^2} dx$, whence $\frac{d^2 v}{dx^2} = \frac{2h}{Kl} v$.

75. In whatever manner this equation is formed, it is necessary to remark
that the quantity of heat which passes into the lamina whose thickness is $dx$,
has a finite value, and that its exact expression is $-4l^2 K \frac{dv}{dx}$. The lamina being
enclosed between two surfaces the first of which has a temperature $v$, and the
second a lower temperature $v'$, we see that the quantity of heat which it
receives through the first surface depends on the difference $v - v'$, and is pro-
portional to it: but this remark is not sufficient to complete the calculation.
The quantity in question is not a differential: it has a finite value, since it is
equivalent to all the heat which escapes through that part of the external sur-
face of the prism which is situated to the right of the section. To form an exact
idea of it, we must compare the lamina whose thickness is $dx$, with a solid
terminated by two parallel planes whose distance is $e$, and which are main-
tained at unequal temperatures $a$ and $b$. The quantity of heat which passes
into such a prism across the hottest surface, is in fact proportional to the
difference $a - b$ of the extreme temperatures, but it does not depend only on
this difference: all other things being equal, it is less when the prism is thicker,
and in general it is proportional to $\frac{a-b}{e}$. This is why the quantity of heat
which passes through the first surface into the lamina, whose thickness is $dx$, is
proportional to $\frac{dv}{dx}$.

We lay stress on this remark because the neglect of it has been the first
obstacle to the establishment of the theory. If we did not make a complete
analysis of the elements of the problem, we should obtain an equation not
homogeneous, and, *a fortiori*, we should not be able to form the equations
which express the movement of heat in more complex cases.

It was necessary also to introduce into the calculation the dimensions of the
prism, in order that we might not regard, as general, consequences which ob-
servation had furnished in a particular case. Thus, it was discovered by experi-
ment that a bar of iron, heated at one extremity, could not acquire, at a
distance of six feet from the source, a temperature of one degree (*octogesimal*$^1$);
for to produce this effect, it would be necessary for the heat of the source
to surpass considerably the point of fusion of iron; but this result depends on
the thickness of the prism employed. If it had been greater, the heat would
have been propagated to a greater distance, that is to say, the point of the
bar which acquires a fixed temperature of one degree is much more remote
from the source when the bar is thicker, all other conditions remaining the
same. We can always raise by one degree the temperature of one end of a bar
of iron, by heating the solid at the other end; we need only give the radius of
the base a sufficient length: which is, we may say, evident, and of which
besides a proof will be found in the solution of the problem (Art. 78).

76. The integral of the preceding equation is
$v = Ae^{-x\sqrt{2h/Kl}} + Be^{+x\sqrt{2h/Kl}}$.
A and B being two arbitrary constants; now, if we suppose the distance $x$
infinite, the value of the temperature $v$ must be infinitely small; hence the term
$Be^{+x\sqrt{2h/Kl}}$ does not exist in the integral: thus the equation $v = Ae^{-x\sqrt{2h/Kl}}$ represents
the permanent state of the solid; the temperature at the origin is denoted by
the constant A, since that is the value of $v$ when $x$ is zero.

This law according to which the temperatures decrease is the same as that
given by experiment; several physicists have observed the fixed temperatures
at different points of a metal bar exposed at its extremity to the constant
action of a source of heat,$^2$ and they have ascertained that the distances from the
origin represent logarithms, and the temperatures the corresponding numbers.

77. The numerical value of the constant quotient of two consecutive tem-
peratures being determined by observation, we easily deduce the value of the
ratio $\sqrt{2h/Kl}$; for, denoting by $v_1, v_2$ the temperatures corresponding to the distances
$x_1, x_2$, we have
$\frac{v_1}{v_2} = e^{-(x_1-x_2)\sqrt{2h/Kl}}$, whence
$\sqrt{\frac{2h}{Kl}} = \frac{\log v_1 - \log v_2}{x_2 - x_1}$.
As for the separate values of $h$ and $K$, they cannot be determined by experi-
ments of this kind: we must observe also the varying motion of heat.

78. Suppose two bars of the same material and different dimensions to be
submitted at their extremities to the same temperature A; let $l_1$ be the side of
a section in the first bar, and $l_2$ in the second, we shall have, to express the
temperatures of these two solids, the equations
$v_1 = Ae^{-x_1\sqrt{2h/Kl_1}}$ and $v_2 = Ae^{-x_2\sqrt{2h/Kl_2}}$,
$v_1$ in the first solid, denoting the temperature of a section made at distance $x_1$,
and $v_2$, in the second solid, the temperature of a section made at distance $x_2$.

When these two bars have arrived at a fixed state, the temperature of a
section of the first, at a certain distance from the source, will not be equal to
the temperature of a section of the second at the same distance from the focus;
in order that the fixed temperatures may be equal, the distances must be
different. If we wish to compare with each other the distances $x_1$ and $x_2$ from
the origin up to the points which in the two bars attain the same temperature,
we must equate the second members of these equations, and from them we
conclude that $\frac{x_1}{x_2} = \sqrt{\frac{l_1}{l_2}}$. Thus the distances in question are to each other as the
square roots of the thicknesses.

79. If two metal bars of equal dimensions, but formed of different sub-
stances, are covered with the same coating, which gives them the same external
conducibility, and if they are submitted at their extremities to the same
temperature, heat will be propagated most easily and to the greatest distance
from the origin in that which has the greatest conductivity. To compare with
each other the distances $x_1$ and $x_2$ from the common origin up to the points
which acquire the same fixed temperature, we must, after denoting the respec-
tive conducibilities of the two substances by $K_1$ and $K_2$, write the equation
$e^{-x_1\sqrt{2h/K_1l}} = e^{-x_2\sqrt{2h/K_2l}}$, whence $\frac{x_1^2}{x_2^2} = \frac{K_1}{K_2}$.
Thus the ratio of the two conductivities is that of the squares of the
distances from the common origin to the points which attain the same fixed
temperature.

80. It is easy to ascertain how much heat flows during unit of time through a
section of the bar arrived at its fixed state: this quantity is expressed by
$-4Kl^2 \frac{dv}{dx}$, or $4A \sqrt{2Kh/l} l^2 e^{-x\sqrt{2h/Kl}}$, and if we take its value at the origin, we shall
have $4A\sqrt{2Kh/l} l^2$ as the measure of the quantity of heat which passes from the
source into the solid during unit of time; thus the expenditure of the source of
heat is, all other things being equal, proportional to the square root of the cube
of the thickness.

We should obtain the same result on taking the integral $\int 8hlv dx$ from $x = 0$
to $x = \infty$.

## SECTION VI. On the Heating of Closed Spaces

81. We shall again make use of the theorems of Article 72 in the following
problem, whose solution offers useful applications; it consists in determining
the extent of the heating of closed spaces.

Imagine a closed space, of any form whatever, to be filled with atmospheric
air and closed on all sides, and that all parts of the boundary are homogeneous
and have a common thickness $e$, so small that the ratio of the external surface
to the internal surface differs little from unity. The space which this boundary
terminates is heated by a source whose action is constant; for example, by
means of a surface whose area is $\sigma$ maintained at a constant temperature $\alpha$.

We consider here only the mean temperature of the air contained in the
space, without regard to the unequal distribution of heat in this mass of air;
thus we suppose that the existing causes incessantly mingle all the portions of
air, and make their temperatures uniform.

We see first that the heat which continually leaves the source spreads itself
in the surrounding air and penetrates the mass of which the boundary is
formed, is partly dispersed at the surface, and passes into the external air,
which we suppose to be maintained at a lower and permanent temperature $\eta$.
The inner air is heated more and more: the same is the case with the solid
boundary: the system of temperatures steadily approaches a final state which
is the object of the problem, and has the property of existing by itself and of
being kept up unchanged, provided the surface of the source $\sigma$ be maintained
at the temperature $\alpha$, and the external air at the temperature $\eta$.

In the permanent state which we wish to determine the air preserves a fixed
temperature $m$; the temperature of the inner surface $S$ of the solid boundary
has also a fixed value $\alpha$; lastly, the outer surface $S$, which terminates the enclos-
ure, preserves a fixed temperature $b$ less than $\alpha$, but greater than $\eta$. The quan-
tities $\sigma, \alpha, S, e$ and $\eta$ are known, and the quantities $m, \alpha$ and $b$ are unknown.

The degree of heating consists in the excess of the temperature $m$ over $\eta$, the
temperature of the external air; this excess evidently depends on the area $\sigma$
of the heating surface and on its temperature $\alpha$; it depends also on the thick-
ness $e$ of the enclosure, on the area $S$ of the surface which bounds it, on the
facility with which heat penetrates the inner surface or that which is opposite
to it; finally, on the specific conductivity of the solid mass which forms the
enclosure: for if any one of these elements were to be changed, the others
remaining the same, the degree of the heating would vary also. The problem is
to determine how all these quantities enter into the value of $m - \eta$.

82. The solid boundary is terminated by two equal surfaces, each of which is
maintained at a fixed temperature; every prismatic element of the solid
enclosed between two opposite portions of these surfaces, and the normals
raised round the contour of the bases, is therefore in the same state as if it
belonged to an infinite solid enclosed between two parallel planes, maintained
at unequal temperatures. All the prismatic elements which compose the
boundary touch along their whole length. The points of the mass which are
equidistant from the inner surface have equal temperatures, to whatever
prism they belong; consequently there cannot be any transfer of heat in the
direction perpendicular to the length of these prisms. The case is, therefore,
the same as that of which we have already treated, and we must apply to it
the linear equations which have been stated in former articles.

83. Thus in the permanent state which we are considering, the flow of heat
which leaves the surface $\sigma$ during a unit of time, is equal to that which, during
the same time, passes from the surrounding air into the inner surface of the
enclosure; it is equal also to that which, in a unit of time, crosses an inter-
mediate section made within the solid enclosure by a surface equal and parallel
to those which bound this enclosure; lastly, the same flow is again equal to
that which passes from the solid enclosure across its external surface, and is
dispersed into the air. If these four quantities of flow of heat were not equal,
some variation would necessarily occur in the state of the temperatures, which
is contrary to the hypothesis.

The first quantity is expressed by $\sigma(\alpha - m)g$, denoting by $g$ the external
conducibility of the surface $\sigma$, which belongs to the source of heat.

The second is $S(m - \alpha)h$, the coefficient $h$ being the measure of the external con-
ducibility of the surface $S$, which is exposed to the action of the source of heat.

The third is $S \frac{\alpha - b}{e} K$, the coefficient $K$ being the measure of the conduci-
bility proper to the homogeneous substance which forms the boundary.

The fourth is $S(b - \eta)H$, denoting by $H$ the external conductivity of the
surface $S$, which the heat quits to be dispersed into the air. The coefficients $h$
and $H$ may have very unequal values on account of the difference of the state
of the two surfaces which bound the enclosure; they are supposed to be known,
as also the coefficient $K$: we shall have then, to determine the three unknown
quantities $m, \alpha$ and $b$, the three equations:

$\sigma(\alpha - m)g = S(m - \alpha)h$,
$\sigma(\alpha - m)g = S \frac{\alpha - b}{e} K$,
$\sigma(\alpha - m)g = S(b - \eta)H$.

84. The value of $m$ is the special object of the problem. It may be found by
writing the equations in the form

$m - \alpha = \frac{\sigma g}{Sh} (\alpha - m)$,
$\alpha - b = \frac{\sigma g e}{SK} (\alpha - m)$,
$b - \eta = \frac{\sigma g}{SH} (\alpha - m)$;
adding, we have
$m - \eta = (\alpha - m) P$,
denoting by $P$ the known quantity
$P = \frac{\sigma g}{S} \left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)$,
whence we conclude
$m - \eta = (\alpha - \eta) \frac{P}{1 + P} = (\alpha - \eta) \frac{\frac{\sigma g}{S} \left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)}{1 + \frac{\sigma g}{S} \left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)}$.

85. The result shows how $m - \eta$, the extent of the heating, depends on given
quantities which constitute the hypothesis. We will indicate the chief results
to be derived from it.

1st. The extent of the heating $m - \eta$ is directly proportional to the excess of
the temperature of the source over that of the external air.

2nd. The value of $m - \eta$ does not depend on the form of the enclosure nor on
its volume, but only on the ratio $\frac{\sigma}{S}$ of the surface from which the heat proceeds
to the surface which receives it, and also on $e$ the thickness of the boundary.
If we double $\sigma$ the surface of the source of heat, the extent of the heating
does not become double, but increases according to a certain law which the
equation expresses.

3rd. All the specific coefficients which regulate the action of the heat, that is
to say, $g, K, H$ and $h$, compose, with the dimension $e$, in the value of $m - \eta$ a
single element $\left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)$, whose value may be determined by observation.
If we doubled $e$ the thickness of the boundary, we should have the same
result if, in forming it, we employed a substance whose conductivity proper
was twice as great. Thus the employment of substances which are bad con-
ductors of heat permits us to make the thickness of the boundary small; the
effect which is obtained depends only on the ratio $\frac{e}{K}$.

4th. If the conducibility $K$ is nothing, we find $m = \alpha$; that is to say, the
inner air assumes the temperature of the source: the same is the case if $H$ is
zero, or $h$ zero. These consequences are otherwise evident, since the heat can-
not then be dispersed into the external air.

5th. The values of the quantities $g, H, h, K$ and $\alpha$, which we supposed
known, may be measured by direct experiments, as we shall show in the
sequel; but in the actual problem, it will be sufficient to notice the value of
$m - \eta$ which corresponds to given values of $\sigma$ and of $\alpha$, and this value may be
used to determine the whole coefficient $\left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)$, by means of the equation
$m - \eta = (\alpha - \eta) \frac{(\sigma g/S) p}{1 + (\sigma g/S) p}$,
in which $p$ denotes the coefficient sought. We
must substitute in this equation, instead of $\frac{\sigma}{S}$ and $\alpha - \eta$, the values of those
quantities, which we suppose given, and that of $m - \eta$ which observation will
have made known. From it may be derived the value of $p$, and we may then
apply the formula to any number of other cases.

6th. The coefficient $H$ enters into the value of $m - \eta$ in the same manner as
the coefficient $h$; consequently the state of the surface, or that of the envelope
which covers it, produces the same effect, whether it has reference to the inner
or outer surface.

We should have considered it useless to take notice of these different conse-
quences, if we were not treating here of entirely new problems, whose results
may be of direct use.

86. We know that animated bodies retain a temperature sensibly fixed,
which we may regard as independent of the temperature of the medium in
which they live. These bodies are, after some fashion, constant sources of heat,
just as inflamed substances are in which the combustion has become uniform.
We may then, by aid of the preceding remarks, foresee and regulate exactly
the rise of temperature in places where a great number of men are collected
together. If we there observe the height of the thermometer under given cir-
cumstances, we shall determine in advance what that height would be, if the
number of men assembled in the same space became very much greater.

In reality, there are several accessory circumstances which modify the
results, such as the unequal thickness of the parts of the enclosure, the
difference of their aspect, the effects which the outlets produce, the unequal
distribution of heat in the air. We cannot therefore rigorously apply the rules
given by analysis; nevertheless these rules are valuable in themselves, because
they contain the true principles of the matter: they prevent vague reasonings
and useless or confused attempts.

87. If the same space were heated by two or more sources of different kinds,
or if the first enclosure were itself contained in a second enclosure separated
from the first by a mass of air, we might easily determine in like manner the
degree of heating and the temperature of the surfaces.

If we suppose that, besides the first source $\sigma$, there is a second heated sur-
face $\pi$, whose constant temperature is $\varphi$ and external conductivity $\gamma$, we shall
find, all the other denominations being retained, the following equation:
$m - \eta = \frac{(\alpha - \eta)\sigma g + (\varphi - \eta)\pi\gamma}{1 + \frac{\sigma g + \pi\gamma}{S} \left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)}$.

If we suppose only one source $\sigma$, and if the first enclosure is itself contained
in a second, $S', h', K', H', e'$, representing the elements of the second enclosure
which correspond to those of the first which were denoted by $S, h, K, H, e$; we
shall find, $\rho$ denoting the temperature of the air which surrounds the external
surface of the second enclosure, the following equation:
$m - \rho = \frac{(\alpha - \rho)P}{1 + P}$.
The quantity $P$ represents
$P = \frac{\sigma g}{S} \left(\frac{1}{h} + \frac{e}{K} + \frac{1}{H}\right)$.
We should obtain a similar result if we had three or a greater number of suc-
cessive enclosures; and from this we conclude that these solid envelopes,
separated by air, assist very much in increasing the degree of heating, however
small their thickness may be.

88. To make this remark more evident, we will compare the quantity of heat
which escapes from the heated surface, with that which the same body would
lose, if the surface which envelopes it were separated from it by an interval
filled with air.

If the body A be heated by a constant cause, so that its surface preserves a
fixed temperature $\theta$, the air being maintained at a less temperature $\alpha$, the
quantity of heat which escapes into the air in the unit of time across a unit of
surface will be expressed by $h(\theta - \alpha)$, $h$ being the measure of the external con-
ductivity. Hence in order that the mass may preserve a fixed temperature $\theta$,
it is necessary that the source, whatever it may be, should furnish a quantity
of heat equal to $hS(\theta - \alpha)$, $S$ denoting the area of the surface of the solid.

Suppose an extremely thin shell to be detached from the body A and
separated from the solid by an interval filled with air; and suppose the surface
of the same solid A to be still maintained at the temperature $\theta$. We see that the
air contained between the shell and the body will be heated and will take a
temperature $\alpha'$ greater than $\alpha$. The shell itself will attain a permanent state
and will transmit to the external air whose fixed temperature is $\alpha$ all the heat
which the body loses. It follows that the quantity of heat escaping from the
solid will be $hS(\theta - \alpha')$, instead of being $hS(\theta - \alpha)$, for we suppose that the new
surface of the solid and the surfaces which bound the shell have likewise the
same external conducibility $h$. It is evident that the expenditure of the source
of heat will be less than it was at first. The problem is to determine the exact
ratio of these quantities.

89. Let $e$ be the thickness of the shell, $m$ the fixed temperature of its inner
surface, $\eta$ that of its outer surface, and $K$ its internal conductivity. We shall
have, as the expression of the quantity of heat which leaves the solid through
its surface, $hS(\theta - \alpha')$.
As that of the quantity which penetrates the inner surface of the shell,
$hS(\alpha' - m)$.
As that of the quantity which crosses any section whatever of the same
shell, $KS \frac{m - \eta}{e}$.
Lastly, as the expression of the quantity which passes through the outer
surface into the air, $hS(\eta - \alpha)$.

All these quantities must be equal, we have therefore the following equa-
tions:
$h(\eta - \alpha) = \frac{K}{e} (m - \eta)$,
$h(\eta - \alpha) = h(\alpha' - m)$,
$h(\eta - \alpha) = h(\theta - \alpha')$.
If moreover we write down the identical equation
$h(\eta - \alpha) = h(\eta - \alpha)$,

and arrange them all under the forms

n - a = n - a,
m - n = (he/K) (n - a),
a' - m = n - a,
b - a' = n - a,

we find, on addition,

b - a = (n - a) (3 + he/K).

The quantity of heat lost by the solid was hS(b - a) when its surface communicated freely with the air. It is now hS(b - a') or hS(n - a), which is equivalent to hS(b - a) / (3 + he/K).
The first quantity is greater than the second in the ratio of (3 + he/K) to 1.

In order therefore to maintain at temperature b a solid whose surface communicates directly to the air, more than three times as much heat is necessary than would be required to maintain it at temperature b, when its extreme surface is not adherent but separated from the solid by any small interval whatever filled with air.

If we suppose the thickness e to be infinitely small, the ratio of the quantities of heat lost will be 3, which would also be the value if K were infinitely great.

We can easily account for this result, for the heat being unable to escape into the external air, without penetrating several surfaces, the quantity which flows out must diminish as the number of interposed surfaces increases; but we should have been unable to arrive at any exact judgment in this case, if the problem had not been submitted to analysis.

90. We have not considered, in the preceding article, the effect of radiation across the layer of air which separates the two surfaces; nevertheless this circumstance modifies the problem, since there is a portion of heat which

212 FOURIER Chap. I

passes directly across the intervening air. We shall suppose then, to make the object of the analysis more distinct, that the interval between the surfaces is free from air, and that the heated body is covered by any number whatever of parallel laminae separated from each other.

If the heat which escapes from the solid through its plane superficies maintained at a temperature b expanded itself freely in *vacuo* and was received by a parallel surface maintained at a less temperature a, the quantity which would be dispersed in unit of time across unit of surface would be proportional to (b - a), the difference of the two constant temperatures: this quantity would be represented by H(b - a), H being the value of the relative conducibility which is not the same as h.

The source which maintains the solid in its original state must therefore furnish, in every unit of time, a quantity of heat equal to HS(b - a).

We must now determine the new value of this expenditure in the case where the surface of the body is covered by several successive laminae separated by intervals free from air, supposing always that the solid is subject to the action of any external cause whatever which maintains its surface at the temperature b.

Imagine the whole system of temperatures to have become fixed; let m_1 be the temperature of the under surface of the first lamina which is consequently opposite to that of the solid, let n_1 be the temperature of the upper surface of the same lamina, e its thickness, and K its specific conductivity; denote also by m_1, n_1, m_2, n_2, m_3, n_3, m_4, n_4, &c. the temperatures of the under and upper surfaces of the different laminae, and by K and e the conductivity and thickness of the same laminae; lastly suppose all these surfaces to be in a state similar to the surface of the solid, so that the value of the coefficient H is common to them.

The quantity of heat which penetrates the under surface of a lamina corresponding to any suffix i is HS(n_{i-1} - m_i), that which crosses this lamina is (KS/e) (m_i - n_i), and the quantity which escapes from its upper surface is HS(n_i - m_{i+1}). These three quantities, and all those which refer to the other laminae are equal; we may therefore form the equation by comparing all these quantities in question with the first of them, which is HS(b - m_1); we shall thus have, denoting the number of laminae by j:

b - m_1 = b - m_1,
m_1 - n_1 = (He/K) (b - m_1),
n_1 - m_2 = b - m_1,
m_2 - n_2 = (He/K) (b - m_1),
...
m_j - n_j = (He/K) (b - m_1),
n_j - a = b - m_1.

Adding these equations, we find

b - a = (b - m_1) [j(1 + He/K) + 1].

The expenditure of the source of heat necessary to maintain the surface of the body A at the temperature b is HS(b - a), when this surface sends its rays to a fixed surface maintained at the temperature a. The expenditure is

Sect. VII THEORY OF HEAT 213

HS(b - m_1) when we place between the surface of the body A, and the fixed surface maintained at temperature a, a number j of isolated laminae; thus the quantity of heat which the source must furnish is very much less in the second hypothesis than in the first, and the ratio of the two quantities is 1 / [j(1 + He/K) + 1].

If we suppose the thickness e of the laminae to be infinitely small, the ratio is 1 / (j+1). The expenditure of the source is then inversely as the number of laminae which cover the surface of the solid.

91. The examination of these results and of those which we obtained when the intervals between successive enclosures were occupied by atmospheric air explain clearly why the separation of surfaces and the intervention of air assist very much in retaining heat.

Analysis furnishes in addition analogous consequences when we suppose the source to be external, and that the heat which emanates from it crosses successively different diathermanous envelopes and the air which they enclose. This is what has happened when experimenters have exposed to the rays of the sun thermometers covered by several sheets of glass within which different layers of air have been enclosed.

For similar reasons the temperature of the higher regions of the atmosphere is very much less than at the surface of the earth.

In general the theorems concerning the heating of air in closed spaces extend to a great variety of problems. It would be useful to revert to them when we wish to foresee and regulate temperature with precision, as in the case of green-houses, drying-houses, sheep-folds, work-shops, or in many civil establishments, such as hospitals, barracks, places of assembly.

In these different applications we must attend to accessory circumstances which modify the results of analysis, such as the unequal thickness of different parts of the enclosure, the introduction of air, &c.; but these details would draw us away from our chief object, which is the exact demonstration of general principles.

For the rest, we have considered only, in what has just been said, the permanent state of temperature in closed spaces. We can in addition express analytically the variable state which precedes, or that which begins to take place when the source of heat is withdrawn, and we can also ascertain in this way, how the specific properties of the bodies which we employ, or their dimensions affect the progress and duration of the heating; but these researches require a different analysis, the principles of which will be explained in the following chapters.

## SECTION VII. On the Uniform Movement of Heat in Three Dimensions

92. Up to this time we have considered the uniform movement of heat in one dimension only, but it is easy to apply the same principles to the case in which heat is propagated uniformly in three directions at right angles.

Suppose the different points of a solid enclosed by six planes at right angles to have unequal actual temperatures represented by the linear equation v = A + ax + by + cz, x, y, z being the rectangular co-ordinates of a molecule whose temperature is v. Suppose further that any external causes whatever acting on the six faces of the prism maintain every one of the molecules situated on the surface, at its actual temperature expressed by the general equation

v = A + ax + by + cz ... (a),

we shall prove that the same causes which, by hypothesis, keep the outer layers of the solid in their initial state, are sufficient to preserve also the actual temperatures of every one of the inner molecules, so that their temperatures do not cease to be represented by the linear equation.

The examination of this question is an element of the general theory, it will serve to determine the laws of the varied movement of heat in the interior of a solid of any form whatever, for every one of the prismatic molecules of which the body is composed is during an infinitely small time in a state similar to that which the linear equation (a) expresses. We may then, by following the ordinary principles of the differential calculus, easily deduce from the notion of uniform movement the general equations of varied movement.

93. In order to prove that when the extreme layers of the solid preserve their temperatures no change can happen in the interior of the mass, it is sufficient to compare with each other the quantities of heat which, during the same instant, cross two parallel planes.

Let p be the perpendicular distance of these two planes which we first suppose parallel to the horizontal plane of x and y. Let m and m' be two infinitely near molecules, one of which is above the first horizontal plane and the other below it: let x, y, z be the co-ordinates of the first molecule, and x', y', z' those of the second. In like manner let M and M' denote two infinitely near molecules, separated by the second horizontal plane and situated, relatively to that plane, in the same manner as m and m' are relatively to the first plane; that is to say, the co-ordinates of M are x, y, z+p, and those of M' are x', y', z'+p. It is evident that the distance mm' of the two molecules m and m' is equal to the distance MM' of the two molecules M and M'; further, let v be the temperature of m, and v' that of m', also let V and V' be the temperatures of M and M', it is easy to see that the two differences v - v' and V - V' are equal; in fact, substituting first the co-ordinates of m and m' in the general equation

v = A + ax + by + cz,

we find v - v' = a(x - x') + b(y - y') + c(z - z'),

and then substituting the co-ordinates of M and M', we find also V - V' = a(x - x') + b(y - y') + c(z - z'). Now the quantity of heat which m sends to m' depends on the distance mm', which separates these molecules, and it is proportional to the difference v - v' of their temperatures. This quantity of heat transferred may be represented by

q(v - v')dt;

the value of the coefficient q depends in some manner on the distance mm', and on the nature of the substance of which the solid is formed, dt is the duration of the instant. The quantity of heat transferred from M to M', or the action of M on M' is expressed likewise by q(V - V')dt, and the coefficient q is the same as in the expression q(v - v')dt, since the distance MM' is equal to mm' and the two actions are effected in the same solid: furthermore V - V' is equal to v - v', hence the two actions are equal.

215 Sect. VII THEORY OF HEAT

If we choose two other points n and n', very near to each other, which transfer heat across the first horizontal plane, we shall find in the same manner that their action is equal to that of two homologous points N and N' which communicate heat across the second horizontal plane. We conclude then that the whole quantity of heat which crosses the first plane is equal to that which crosses the second plane during the same instant. We should derive the same result from the comparison of two planes parallel to the plane of x and z, or from the comparison of two other planes parallel to the plane of y and z. Hence any part whatever of the solid enclosed between six planes at right angles, receives through each of its faces as much heat as it loses through the opposite face; hence no portion of the solid can change temperature.

94. Thus, across one of these planes, a quantity of heat flows which is the same at all instants, and which is also the same for all other parallel sections.

In order to determine the value of this constant flow we shall compare it with the quantity of heat which flows uniformly in the most simple case, which has been already discussed. The case is that of an infinite solid enclosed between two infinite planes and maintained in a constant state. We have seen that the temperatures of the different points of the mass are in this case represented by the equation v = A + cz; we proceed to prove that the uniform flow of heat per unit area propagated in the vertical direction in the infinite solid is equal to that which flows in the same direction per unit area across the prism enclosed by six planes at right angles. This equality necessarily exists if the coefficient c in the equation v = A + cz, belonging to the first solid, is the same as the coefficient c in the more general equation v = A + ax + by + cz which represents the state of the prism. In fact, denoting by H a plane in this prism perpendicular to z, and by m and μ two molecules very near to each other, the first of which m is below the plane H, and the second above this plane, let v be the temperature of m whose co-ordinates are x, y, z and w the temperature of μ whose co-ordinates are x+α, y+β, z+γ. Take a third molecule μ' whose co-ordinates are x-α, y-β, z+γ, and whose temperature may be denoted by w'. We see that μ' and μ are on the same horizontal plane, and that the vertical drawn from the middle point of the line μ'μ, which joins these two points, passes through the point m, so that the distances mμ and mμ' are equal. The action of m on μ, or the quantity of heat which the first of these molecules sends to the other across the plane H, depends on the difference v - w of their temperatures. The action of m on μ' depends in the same manner on the difference v - w' of the temperatures of these molecules, since the distance of m from μ' is the same as that of m from μ. Thus, expressing by q(v - w) the action of m on μ during the unit of time, we shall have q(v - w') to express the action of m on μ', q being a common unknown factor, depending on the distance mμ and on the nature of the solid. Hence the sum of the two actions exerted during unit of time is q(v - w + v - w').

If instead of x, y, and z, in the general equation

v = A + ax + by + cz,

we substitute the co-ordinates of m and then those of μ and μ', we shall find

v - w = -aα - bβ - cγ,
v - w' = +aα + bβ - cγ.

The sum of the two actions of m on μ and of m on μ' is therefore -2qcγ.

216 FOURIER Chap. I

Suppose then that the plane H belongs to the infinite solid whose temperature equation is v = A + cz, and that we denote also by m, μ and μ' those molecules in this solid whose co-ordinates are x, y, z for the first, x+α, y+β, z+γ for the second, and x-α, y-β, z+γ for the third: we shall have, as in the preceding case, v - w + v - w' = -2cγ. Thus the sum of the two actions of m on μ and of m on μ', is the same in the infinite solid as in the prism enclosed between the six planes at right angles.

We should obtain a similar result, if we considered the action of another point n below the plane H on two others ν and ν' situated at the same height above the plane. Hence, the sum of all the actions of this kind, which are exerted across the plane H, that is to say the whole quantity of heat which, during unit of time, passes to the upper side of this surface, by virtue of the action of very near molecules which it separates, is always the same in both solids.

95. In the second of these two bodies, that which is bounded by two infinite planes, and whose temperature equation is v = A + cz, we know that the quantity of heat which flows during unit of time across unit of area taken on any horizontal section whatever is -cK, c being the coefficient of z, and K the specific conductivity; hence, the quantity of heat which, in the prism enclosed between six planes at right angles, crosses during unit of time, unit of area taken on any horizontal section whatever, is also -cK, when the linear equation which represents the temperatures of the prism is

v = A + ax + by + cz.

In the same way it may be proved that the quantity of heat which, during unit of time, flows uniformly across unit of area taken on any section whatever perpendicular to x, is expressed by -aK, and that the whole quantity which, during unit of time, crosses unit of area taken on a section perpendicular to y, is expressed by -bK.

The theorems which we have demonstrated in this and the two preceding articles, suppose the direct action of heat in the interior of the mass to be limited to an extremely small distance, but they would still be true, if the rays of heat sent out by each molecule could penetrate directly to a quite appreciable distance, but it would be necessary in this case, as we have remarked in Article 70, to suppose that the cause which maintains the temperatures of the faces of the solid affects a part extending within the mass to a finite depth.

## SECTION VIII. Measure of the Movement of Heat at a Given Point of a Solid Mass

96. It still remains for us to determine one of the principal elements of the theory of heat, which consists in defining and in measuring exactly the quantity of heat which passes through every point of a solid mass across a plane whose direction is given.

If heat is unequally distributed amongst the molecules of the same body, the temperatures at any point will vary every instant. Denoting by t the time which has elapsed, and by v the temperature attained after a time t by an infinitely small molecule whose co-ordinates are x, y, z; the variable state of the solid will be expressed by an equation similar to the following v = F(x, y, z, t). Suppose the function F to be given, and that consequently we can determine

Sect. VIII THEORY OF HEAT 217

at every instant the temperature of any point whatever; imagine that through the point m we draw a horizontal plane parallel to that of x and y, and that on this plane we trace an infinitely small circle ω, whose centre is at m; it is required to determine what is the quantity of heat which during the instant dt will pass across the circle ω from the part of the solid which is below the plane into the part above it.

All points extremely near to the point m and under the plane exert their action during the infinitely small instant dt, on all those which are above the plane and extremely near to the point m, that is to say, each of the points situated on one side of this plane will send heat to each of those which are situated on the other side.

We shall consider as positive an action whose effect is to transport a certain quantity of heat above the plane, and as negative that which causes heat to pass below the plane. The sum of all the partial actions which are exerted across the circle ω, that is to say, the sum of all the quantities of heat which, crossing any point whatever of this circle, pass from the part of the solid below the plane to the part above, compose the flow whose expression is to be found.

It is easy to imagine that this flow may not be the same throughout the whole extent of the solid, and that if at another point m' we traced a horizontal circle ω' equal to the former, the two quantities of heat which rise above these planes ω and ω' during the same instant might not be equal: these quantities are comparable with each other and their ratios are numbers which may be easily determined.

97. We know already the value of the constant flow for the case of linear and uniform movement; thus in the solid enclosed between two infinite horizontal planes, one of which is maintained at the temperature a and the other at the temperature b, the flow of heat is the same for every part of the mass; we may regard it as taking place in the vertical direction only. The value corresponding to unit of surface and to unit of time is K(b - a)/e, e denoting the perpendicular distance of the two planes, and K the specific conducibility: the temperatures at the different points of the solid are expressed by the equation

v = A + (b - a)z/e.

When the problem is that of a solid comprised between six rectangular planes, pairs of which are parallel, and the temperatures at the different points are expressed by the equation

v = A + ax + by + cz,

the propagation takes place at the same time along the directions of x, of y, of z; the quantity of heat which flows across a definite portion of a plane parallel to that of x and y is the same throughout the whole extent of the prism; its value corresponding to unit of surface, and to unit of time is -cK, in the direction of z; it is -bK, in the direction of y; and -aK in that of x.

In general the value of the vertical flow in the two cases which we have just cited, depends only on the coefficient of z and on the specific conductivity K; this value is always equal to -K(∂v/∂z).

The expression of the quantity of heat which, during the instant dt, flows across a horizontal circle infinitely small, whose area is ω, and passes in this

218 FOURIER Chap. I

manner from the part of the solid which is below the plane of the circle to the part above, is, for the two cases in question, -K(∂v/∂z)ωdt.

98. It is easy now to generalise this result and to recognise that it exists in every case of the varied movement of heat expressed by the equation v = F(x, y, z, t).

Let us in fact denote by x', y', z', the co-ordinates of this point m, and its actual temperature by v'. Let x'+ξ, y'+η, z'+ζ, be the co-ordinates of a point μ infinitely near to the point m, and whose temperature is w; ξ, η, ζ are quantities infinitely small added to the co-ordinates x', y', z'; they determine the position of molecules infinitely near to the point m, with respect to three rectangular axes, whose origin is at m, parallel to the axes of x, y, and z. Differentiating the equation

v = F(x, y, z, t)

and replacing the differentials by ξ, η, ζ, we shall have, to express the value of w which is equivalent to v+dv, the linear equation w = v' + (∂v'/∂x)ξ + (∂v'/∂y)η + (∂v'/∂z)ζ; the coefficients v', ∂v'/∂x, ∂v'/∂y, ∂v'/∂z, are functions of x, y, z, t, in which the given and constant values x', y', z', which belong to the point m, have been substituted for x, y, z.

Suppose that the same point m belongs also to a solid enclosed between six rectangular planes, and that the actual temperatures of the points of this prism, whose dimensions are finite, are expressed by the linear equation w = A+aξ+bη+cζ; and that the molecules situated on the faces which bound the solid are maintained by some external cause at the temperature which is assigned to them by the linear equation. ξ, η, ζ are the rectangular co-ordinates of a molecule of the prism, whose temperature is w, referred to three axes whose origin is at m.

This arranged, if we take as the values of the constant coefficients A, a, b, c, which enter into the equation for the prism, the quantities v', ∂v'/∂x, ∂v'/∂y, ∂v'/∂z, which belong to the differential equation; the state of the prism expressed by the equation

w = v' + (∂v'/∂x)ξ + (∂v'/∂y)η + (∂v'/∂z)ζ

will coincide as nearly as possible with the state of the solid; that is to say, all the molecules infinitely near to the point m will have the same temperature, whether we consider them to be in the solid or in the prism. This coincidence of the solid and the prism is quite analogous to that of curved surfaces with the planes which touch them.

It is evident, from this, that the quantity of heat which flows in the solid across the circle ω, during the instant dt, is the same as that which flows in the prism across the same circle; for all the molecules whose actions concur in one effect or the other, have the same temperature in the two solids. Hence, the flow in question, in one solid or the other, is expressed by -K(∂v/∂z)ωdt. It would be -K(∂v/∂y)ωdt, if the circle ω, whose centre is m, were perpendicular to the axis of y, and -K(∂v/∂x)ωdt, if this circle were perpendicular to the axis of x.

219 Sect. VIII THEORY OF HEAT

The value of the flow which we have just determined varies in the solid from one point to another, and it varies also with the time. We might imagine it to have, at all the points of a unit of surface, the same value as at the point m, and to preserve this value during unit of time; the flow would then be expressed by -K(∂v/∂z), it would be -K(∂v/∂y) in the direction of y, and -K(∂v/∂x) in that of x. We shall ordinarily employ in calculation this value of the flow thus referred to unit of time and to unit of surface.

99. This theorem serves in general to measure the velocity with which heat tends to traverse a given point of a plane situated in any manner whatever in the interior of a solid whose temperatures vary with the time. Through the given point m, a perpendicular must be raised upon the plane, and at every point of this perpendicular ordinates must be drawn to represent the actual temperatures at its different points. A plane curve will thus be formed whose axis of abscissae is the perpendicular. The fluxion of the ordinate of this curve, answering to the point m, taken with the opposite sign, expresses the velocity with which heat is transferred across the plane. This fluxion of the ordinate is known to be the tangent of the angle formed by the element of the curve with a parallel to the abscissae.

The result which we have just explained is that of which the most frequent applications have been made in the theory of heat. We cannot discuss the different problems without forming a very exact idea of the value of the flow at every point of a body whose temperatures are variable. It is necessary to insist on this fundamental notion; an example which we are about to refer to will indicate more clearly the use which has been made of it in analysis.

100. Suppose the different points of a cubic mass, an edge of which has the length π, to have unequal actual temperatures represented by the equation v = cos x cos y cos z. The co-ordinates x, y, z are measured on three rectangular axes, whose origin is at the centre of the cube, perpendicular to the faces. The points of the external surface of the solid are at the actual temperature 0, and it is supposed also that external causes maintain at all these points the actual temperature 0. On this hypothesis the body will be cooled more and more, the temperatures of all the points situated in the interior of the mass will vary, and, after an infinite time, they will all attain the temperature 0 of the surface. Now, we shall prove in the sequel, that the variable state of this solid is expressed by the equation

v = e^(-gt) cos x cos y cos z,

the coefficient g is equal to 3K / (DC), K is the specific conductivity of the substance of which the solid is formed, D is the density and C the specific heat; t is the time elapsed.

We here suppose that the truth of this equation is admitted, and we proceed

to examine the use which may be made of it to find the quantity of heat which crosses a given plane parallel to one of the three planes at the right angles.

If, through the point m, whose co-ordinates are x, y, z, we draw a plane perpendicular to z, we shall find, after the mode of the preceding article, that the value of the flow, at this point and across the plane, is −K ∂v/∂z, or K e^{-gt} cos x cos y sin z. The quantity of heat which, during the instant dt, crosses an infinitely small rectangle, situated on this plane, and whose sides are dx and dy, is

K e^{-gt} cos x cos y sin z dx dy dt.

Thus the whole heat which, during the instant dt, crosses the entire area of the same plane, is

∬ K e^{-gt} cos x cos y sin z dx dy dt,

the double integral being taken from x = −π/2 up to x = π/2, and from y = −π/2 up to y = π/2. We find then for the expression of this total heat,

4 K e^{-gt} sin z dt.

If then we take the integral with respect to t, from t = 0 to t = t, we shall find the quantity of heat which has crossed the same plane since the cooling began up to the actual moment. This integral is (4K/g) sin z (1 − e^{-gt}); its value at the surface is

(4K/g) (1 − e^{-gt}),

so that after an infinite time the quantity of heat lost through one of the faces is 4K/g. The same reasoning being applicable to each of the six faces, we conclude that the solid has lost by its complete cooling a total quantity of heat equal to 24K/g, or 8 C D, since g is equivalent to 3K/(C D). The total heat which is dissipated during the cooling must indeed be independent of the special conductivity K, which can only influence more or less the velocity of cooling.

100. A. We may determine in another manner the quantity of heat which the solid loses during a given time, and this will serve in some degree to verify the preceding calculation. In fact, the mass of the rectangular molecule whose dimensions are dx, dy, dz, is D dx dy dz; consequently the quantity of heat which must be given to it to bring it from the temperature 0 to that of boiling water is C D dx dy dz, and if it were required to raise this molecule to the temperature v, the expenditure of heat would be v C D dx dy dz.

It follows from this, that in order to find the quantity by which the heat of the solid, after time t, exceeds that which it contained at the temperature 0, we must take the multiple integral ∭ v C D dx dy dz, between the limits x = −π/2, x = π/2, y = −π/2, y = π/2, z = −π/2, z = π/2.

We thus find, on substituting for v its value, that is to say

v = e^{-gt} cos x cos y cos z,

that the excess of actual heat over that which belongs to the temperature 0 is 8 C D e^{-gt}; or, at the start, 8 C D, as we found before.

We have described, in this introduction, all the elements which it is necessary to know in order to solve different problems relating to the movement of heat in solid bodies, and we have given some applications of these principles, in order to shew the mode of employing them in analysis; the most important use which we have been able to make of them, is to deduce from them the general equations of the propagation of heat, which is the subject of the next chapter.

SECOND CHAPTER

Equations of the Movement of Heat

## SECTION I. Equation of the Varied Movement of Heat in a Ring

101. We might form the general equations which represent the movement of heat in solid bodies of any form whatever, and apply them to particular cases. But this method would often involve very complicated calculations which may easily be avoided. There are several problems which it is preferable to treat in a special manner by expressing the conditions which are appropriate to them; we proceed to adopt this course and examine separately the problems which have been enunciated in the first section of the introduction; we will limit ourselves at first to forming the differential equations, and shall give the integrals of them in the following chapters.

102. We have already considered the uniform movement of heat in a prismatic bar of small thickness whose extremity is immersed in a constant source of heat. This first case offered no difficulties, since there was no reference except to the permanent state of the temperatures, and the equation which expresses them is easily integrated. The following problem requires a more profound investigation; its object is to determine the variable state of a solid ring whose different points have received initial temperatures entirely arbitrary.

The solid ring or armlet is generated by the revolution of a rectangular section about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring (see figure 3). l is the perimeter of the section whose area is S; the coefficient h measures the external conductivity, K the internal conductivity, C the specific capacity for heat, D the density. The line oxx'x" represents the mean circumference of the armlet, or that line which passes through the centres of figure of all the sections; the distance of a section from the origin o is measured by the arc whose length is x; R is the radius of the mean circumference.

It is supposed that on account of the small dimensions and of the form of the section, we may consider the temperature at the different points of the same section to be equal.

103. Imagine that initial arbitrary temperatures have been given to the different sections of the armlet, and that the solid is then exposed to air maintained at the temperature 0, and displaced with a constant velocity; the system of temperatures will continually vary, heat will be transmitted within the ring, and dispersed at the surface: it is required to determine what will be the state of the solid at any given instant.

Let v be the temperature which the section situated at distance x will have acquired after a lapse of time t; v is a certain function of x and t, into which all the initial temperatures also must enter: this is the function which is to be discovered.

104. We will consider the movement of heat in an infinitely small slice, enclosed between a section made at distance x and another section made at distance x + dx. The state of this slice for the duration of one instant is that of an infinite solid terminated by two parallel planes maintained at unequal temperatures; thus the quantity of heat which flows during this instant dt across the first section, and passes in this way from the part of the solid which precedes the slice into the slice itself, is measured according to the principles established in the introduction, by the product of four factors, that is to say, the conducibility K, the area of the section S, the ratio ∂v/∂x, and the duration of the instant; its expression is −K S (∂v/∂x) dt. To determine the quantity of heat which escapes from the same slice across the second section, and passes into the contiguous part of the solid, it is only necessary to change x into x + dx in the preceding expression, or, which is the same thing, to add to this expression its differential taken with respect to x; thus the slice receives through one of its faces a quantity of heat equal to −K S (∂v/∂x) dt, and loses through the opposite face a quantity of heat expressed by

−K S (∂v/∂x) dt − K S (∂^2 v/∂x^2) dx dt.

It acquires therefore by reason of its position a quantity of heat equal to the difference of the two preceding quantities, that is

K S (∂^2 v/∂x^2) dx dt.

On the other hand, the same slice, whose external surface is l dx and whose temperature differs infinitely little from v, allows a quantity of heat equivalent to h l v dx dt to escape into the air during the instant dt; it follows from this that this infinitely small part of the solid retains in reality a quantity of heat represented by

K S (∂^2 v/∂x^2) dx dt − h l v dx dt

which makes its temperature vary. The amount of this change must be examined.

105. The coefficient C expresses how much heat is required to raise unit of weight of the substance in question from temperature 0 up to temperature 1; consequently, multiplying the volume S dx of the infinitely small slice by the density D, to obtain its weight, and by C the specific capacity for heat, we shall have C D S dx as the quantity of heat which would raise the volume of the slice from temperature 0 up to temperature 1. Hence the increase of temperature which results from the addition of a quantity of heat equal to K S (∂^2 v/∂x^2) dx dt − h l v dx dt will be found by dividing the last quantity by C D S dx. Denoting therefore, according to custom, the increase of temperature which takes place during the instant dt by ∂v/∂t dt, we shall have the equation

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) ∂^2 v/∂x^2 − (h l)/(C D S) v.

We shall explain in the sequel the use which may be made of this equation to determine the complete solution, and what the difficulty of the problem consists in; we limit ourselves here to a remark concerning the permanent state of the armlet.

106. Suppose that, the plane of the ring being horizontal, sources of heat, each of which exerts a constant action, are placed below different points m, n, p, q etc.; heat will be propagated in the solid, and that which is dissipated through the surface being incessantly replaced by that which emanates from the sources, the temperature of every section of the solid will approach more and more to a stationary value which varies from one section to another. In order to express by means of equation (b) the law of the latter temperatures, which would exist of themselves if they were once established, we must suppose that the quantity v does not vary with respect to t; which annuls the term ∂v/∂t. We thus have the equation

(K/(C D)) (d^2 v/dx^2) = (h l)/(C D S) v,

whence v = M e^{ax} + N e^{-ax},

M and N being two constants.

107. Suppose a portion of the circumference of the ring, situated between two successive sources of heat, to be divided into equal parts, and denote by v1, v2, v3, v4, &c., the temperatures at the points of division whose distances from the origin are x1, x2, x3, x4, &c.; the relation between v and x will be given by the preceding equation, after the two constants have been determined by means of the two values of v corresponding to the sources of heat. Denoting by a the quantity and by X the distance x2 − x1 of two consecutive points of division, we shall have the equations:

v1 = M a^{x1} + N a^{-x1},
v2 = M a^{x2} + N a^{-x2},
v3 = M a^{x3} + N a^{-x3},

whence we derive the following relation

(v1 + v3)/v2 = a^X + a^{-X}.

We should find a similar result for the three points whose temperatures are v2, v3, and in general for any three consecutive points. It follows from this that if we observed the temperatures v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 etc. of several successive points, all situated between the same two sources and separated by a constant interval X, we should perceive that any three consecutive temperatures are always such that the sum of the two extremes divided by the mean gives a constant quotient a^X + a^{-X}.

108. If, in the space included between the next two sources of heat n and p, the temperatures of other different points separated by the same interval X were observed, it would still be found that for any three consecutive points, the sum of the two extreme temperatures, divided by the mean, gives the same quotient a^X + a^{-X}. The value of this quotient depends neither on the position nor on the intensity of the sources of heat.

109. Let q be this constant value, we have the equation

v_{i+2} = q v_{i+1} − v_i;

we see by this that when the circumference is divided into equal parts, the temperatures at the points of division, included between two consecutive sources of heat, are represented by the terms of a recurring series whose scale of relation is composed of two terms q and −1.

Experiments have fully confirmed this result. We have exposed a metallic ring to the permanent and simultaneous action of different sources of heat, and we have observed the stationary temperatures of several points separated by constant intervals; we always found that the temperatures of any three consecutive points, not separated by a source of heat, were connected by the relation in question. Even if the sources of heat be multiplied, and in whatever manner they be disposed, no change can be effected in the numerical value of the quotient

(v1 + v3)/v2;

it depends only on the dimensions or on the nature of the ring, and not on the manner in which that solid is heated.

110. When we have found, by observation, the value of the constant quotient q or (v1 + v3)/v2, the value of a may be derived from it by means of the equation a^X + a^{-X} = q. One of the roots is a^X and the other root is a^{-X}. This quantity being determined, we may derive from it the value of the ratio K/(C D), which is

K/(C D) = (log a)^2/X^2.

Denoting a^X by ω, we shall have ω^2 − q ω + 1 = 0. Thus the ratio of the two conductivities is found by multiplying K/(C D) by the square of the hyperbolic logarithm of one of the roots of the equation ω^2 − q ω + 1 = 0, and dividing the product by X^2.

## SECTION II. Equation of the Varied Movement of Heat in a Solid Sphere

111. A solid homogeneous mass, of the form of a sphere, having been immersed for an infinite time in a medium maintained at a permanent temperature 1, is then exposed to air which is kept at temperature 0, and displaced with constant velocity: it is required to determine the successive states of the body during the whole time of the cooling.

Denote by x the distance of any point whatever from the centre of the sphere, and by v the temperature of the same point, after a time t has elapsed; and suppose, to make the problem more general, that the initial temperature, common to all points situated at the distance x from the centre, is different for different values of x; which is what would have been the case if the immersion had not lasted for an infinite time.

Points of the solid, equally distant from the centre, will not cease to have a common temperature; v is thus a function of x and t. When we suppose t = 0, it is essential that the value of this function should agree with the initial state which is given, and which is entirely arbitrary.

112. We shall consider the instantaneous movement of heat in an infinitely thin shell, bounded by two spherical surfaces whose radii are x and x + dx: the quantity of heat which, during an infinitely small instant dt, crosses the lesser surface whose radius is x, and so passes from that part of the solid which is nearest to the centre into the spherical shell, is equal to the product of four factors which are the conductivity K, the duration dt, the extent 4π x^2 of the surface, and the ratio ∂v/∂x, taken with the negative sign; it is expressed by

−4π K x^2 (∂v/∂x) dt.

To determine the quantity of heat which flows during the same instant through the second surface of the same shell, and passes from this shell into the part of the solid which envelops it, x must be changed into x + dx in the preceding expression: that is to say, to the term −4π K x^2 (∂v/∂x) dt must be added the differential of this term taken with respect to x. We thus find

−4π K x^2 (∂v/∂x) dt − 4π K d[x^2 ∂v/∂x] dt

as the expression of the quantity of heat which leaves the spherical shell across its second surface; and if we subtract this quantity from that which enters through the first surface, we shall have

4π K ∂/∂x (x^2 ∂v/∂x) dx dt.

This difference is evidently the quantity of heat which accumulates in the intervening shell, and whose effect is to vary its temperature.

113. The coefficient C denotes the quantity of heat which is necessary to raise, from temperature 0 to temperature 1, a definite unit of weight; D is the weight of unit of volume; 4π x^2 dx is the volume of the intervening layer, differing from it only by a quantity which may be omitted: hence 4π C D x^2 dx is the quantity of heat necessary to raise the intervening shell from temperature 0 to temperature 1. Hence it is requisite to divide the quantity of heat which accumulates in this shell by 4π C D x^2 dx, and we shall then find the increase of its temperature v during the time dt. We thus obtain the equation

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) [∂^2 v/∂x^2 + (2/x) ∂v/∂x].

114. The preceding equation represents the law of the movement of heat in the interior of the solid, but the temperatures of points in the surface are subject also to a special condition which must be expressed. This condition relative to the state of the surface may vary according to the nature of the problems discussed: we may suppose for example, that, after having heated the sphere, and raised all its molecules to the temperature of boiling water, the cooling is effected by giving to all points in the surface the temperature 0, and by retaining them at this temperature by any external cause whatever. In this case we may imagine the sphere, whose variable state it is desired to determine, to be covered by a very thin envelope on which the cooling agency exerts its action. It may be supposed, 1°, that this infinitely thin envelope adheres to the solid, that it is of the same substance as the solid and that it forms a part of it, like the other portions of the mass; 2°, that all the molecules of the envelope are subjected to temperature 0 by a cause always in action which prevents the temperature from ever being above or below zero. To express this condition theoretically, the function φ which contains x and t, must be made to become null, when we give to x its complete value X equal to the radius of the sphere, whatever else the value of t may be. We should then have, on this hypothesis, if we denote by φ(x,t) the function of x and t, which expresses the value of v, the two equations

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) [∂^2 v/∂x^2 + (2/x) ∂v/∂x]

and φ(X,t) = 0.

Further, it is necessary that the initial state should be represented by the same function φ: we shall therefore have as a second condition φ(x,0) = 1. Thus the variable state of a solid sphere on the hypothesis which we have first described will be represented by a function v, which must satisfy the three preceding equations. The first is general, and belongs at every instant to all points of the mass; the second affects only the molecules at the surface, and the third belongs only to the initial state.

115. If the solid is being cooled in air, the second equation is different; it must then be imagined that the very thin envelope is maintained by some external cause, in a state such as to produce the escape from the sphere, at every instant, of a quantity of heat equal to that which the presence of the medium can carry away from it.

Now the quantity of heat which, during an infinitely small instant dt, flows within the interior of the solid across the spherical surface situate at distance x, is equal to −4π K x^2 (∂v/∂x) dt; and this general expression is applicable to all values of x. Thus, by supposing x = X we shall ascertain the quantity of heat which in the variable state of the sphere would pass across the very thin envelope which bounds it; on the other hand, the external surface of the solid having a variable temperature, which we shall denote by V, would permit the escape into the air of a quantity of heat proportional to that temperature, and to the extent of the surface, which is 4π X^2. The value of this quantity is 4π h X^2 V dt.

To express, as is supposed, that the action of the envelope supplies the place, at every instant, of that which would result from the presence of the medium, it is sufficient to equate the quantity 4π h X^2 V dt to the value which the expression −4π K X^2 (∂v/∂x) dt receives when we give to x its complete value X; hence we obtain the equation

−K (∂v/∂x) |_{x=X} = h V,

or, writing V for v(X,t),

K (∂v/∂x) |_{x=X} + h v(X,t) = 0.

116. The value of ∂v/∂x taken when x = X must therefore have a constant ratio to the value of v which corresponds to the same point. Thus we shall suppose that the external cause of the cooling determines always the state of the very thin envelope, in such a manner that the value of ∂v/∂x which results from this state, is proportional to the value of v corresponding to x = X, and that the constant ratio of these two quantities is −h/K. This condition being fulfilled by means of some cause always present, which prevents the extreme value of ∂v/∂x from being anything else but −(h/K) v, the action of the envelope will take the place of that of the air.

It is not necessary to suppose the envelope to be extremely thin, and it will be seen in the sequel that it may have an indefinite thickness. Here the thickness is considered to be indefinitely small, so as to fix the attention on the state of the surface only of the solid.

117. Hence it follows that the three equations which are required to determine the function φ(x,t) or v are the following,

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) [∂^2 v/∂x^2 + (2/x) ∂v/∂x],

K (∂v/∂x)|_{x=X} + h v(X,t) = 0,

φ(x,0) = 1.

The first applies to all possible values of x and t; the second is satisfied when x = X, whatever be the value of t; and the third is satisfied when t = 0, whatever be the value of x.

It might be supposed that in the initial state all the spherical layers have not the same temperature: which is what would necessarily happen, if the immersion were imagined not to have lasted for an indefinite time. In this case, which is more general than the foregoing, the given function, which expresses the initial temperature of the molecules situated at distance x from the centre of the sphere, will be represented by F(x); the third equation will then be replaced by the following, φ(x,0) = F(x).

Nothing more remains than a purely analytical problem, whose solution will be given in one of the following chapters. It consists in finding the value of v, by means of the general condition, and the two special conditions to which it is subject.

## SECTION III. Equations of the Varied Movement of Heat in a Solid Cylinder

118. A solid cylinder of infinite length, whose side is perpendicular to its circular base, having been wholly immersed in a liquid whose temperature is uniform, has been gradually heated, in such a manner that all points equally distant from the axis have acquired the same temperature; it is then exposed to a current of colder air; it is required to determine the temperatures of the different layers, after a given time.

x denotes the radius of a cylindrical surface, all of whose points are equally distant from the axis; X is the radius of the cylinder; v is the temperature which points of the solid, situated at distance x from the axis, must have after the lapse of a time denoted by t, since the beginning of the cooling. Thus v is a function of x and t and if in it t be made equal to 0, the function of x which arises from this must necessarily satisfy the initial state, which is arbitrary.

119. Consider the movement of heat in an infinitely thin portion of the cylinder, included between the surface whose radius is x, and that whose radius is x + dx. The quantity of heat which this portion receives during the instant dt, from the part of the solid which it envelops, that is to say, the quantity which during the same time crosses the cylindrical surface whose radius is x and whose length is supposed to be equal to unity, is expressed by

−2π K x (∂v/∂x) dt.

To find the quantity of heat which, crossing the second surface whose radius is x + dx, passes from the infinitely thin shell into the part of the solid which envelops it, we must, in the foregoing expression, change x into x + dx, or, which is the same thing, add to the term −2π K x (∂v/∂x) dt the differential of this term, taken with respect to x. Hence the difference of the heat received and the heat lost, or the quantity of heat which accumulating in the infinitely thin shell determines the changes of temperature, is the same differential taken with the opposite sign, or

2π K ∂/∂x (x ∂v/∂x) dx dt.

On the other hand, the volume of this intervening shell is 2π x dx, and 2π C D x dx expresses the quantity of heat required to raise it from the temperature 0 to the temperature 1, C being the specific heat, and D the density. Hence the quotient

[2π K ∂/∂x (x ∂v/∂x) dx dt] / [2π C D x dx]

is the increment which the temperature receives during the instant dt. Whence we obtain the equation

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) [∂^2 v/∂x^2 + (1/x) ∂v/∂x].

120. The quantity of heat which, during the instant dt, crosses the cylindrical surface whose radius is x, being expressed in general by −2π K x (∂v/∂x) dt, we shall find that quantity which escapes during the same time from the surface of the solid, by making x = X in the foregoing value; on the other hand, the same quantity, dispersed into the air, is, by the principle of the communication of heat, equal to 2π X h v dt; we must therefore have at the surface the definite equation

−K (∂v/∂x)|_{x=X} = h v(X,t),

or

K (∂v/∂x)|_{x=X} + h v(X,t) = 0.

The nature of these equations is explained at greater length, either in the articles which refer to the sphere, or in those wherein the general equations have been given for a body of any form whatever. The function v which represents the movement of heat in an infinite cylinder must therefore satisfy, 1st, the general equation

∂v/∂t = (K/(C D)) [∂^2 v/∂x^2 + (1/x) ∂v/∂x]

which applies whatever x and t may be; 2nd, the definite equation K (∂v/∂x)|_{x=X} + h v(X,t) = 0, which is true, whatever the variable t may be, when x = X; 3rd, the definite equation v = F(x). The last condition must be satisfied by all values of v, when t is made equal to 0, whatever the variable x may be. The arbitrary function F(x) is supposed to be known; it corresponds to the initial state.

## SECTION IV. Equations of the Uniform Movement of Heat in a Solid Prism of Infinite Length

121. A prismatic bar is immersed at one extremity in a constant source of heat which maintains that extremity at the temperature A; the rest of the bar, whose length is infinite, continues to be exposed to a uniform current of atmospheric air maintained at temperature 0; it is required to determine the highest temperature which a given point of the bar can acquire.

The problem differs from that of Article 73, since we now take into consideration all the dimensions of the solid, which is necessary in order to obtain an exact solution.

We are led, indeed, to suppose that in a bar of very small thickness all points of the same section would acquire sensibly equal temperatures; but some uncertainty may rest on the results of this hypothesis. It is therefore preferable to solve the problem rigorously, and then to examine, by analysis, up to what point, and in what cases, we are justified in considering the temperatures of different points of the same section to be equal.

122. The section made at right angles to the length of the bar, is a square whose side is 2l, the axis of the bar is the axis of x, and the origin is at the extremity A. The three rectangular co-ordinates of a point of the bar are x, y, z, and v denotes the fixed temperature at the same point.

The problem consists in determining the temperatures which must be assigned to different points of the bar, in order that they may continue to exist without any change, so long as the extreme surface *A*, which communicates with the source of heat, remains subject, at all its points, to the permanent temperature *A*; thus *v* is a function of *x*, *y*, and *z*.

123. Consider the movement of heat in a prismatic molecule, enclosed between six planes perpendicular to the three axes of *x*, *y*, and *z*. The first three planes pass through the point *m* whose co-ordinates are *x*, *y*, *z*, and the others pass through the point *m'* whose co-ordinates are *x+dx*, *y+dy*, *z+dz*.

To find what quantity of heat enters the molecule during unit of time across the first plane passing through the point *m* and perpendicular to *x*, we must remember that the extent of the surface of the molecule on this plane is *dy dz*, and that the flow across this area is, according to the theorem of Article 98, equal to `-K(dv/dx)`; thus the molecule receives across the rectangle *dy dz* passing through the point *m* a quantity of heat expressed by `-K dy dz (dv/dx)`. To find the quantity of heat which crosses the opposite face, and escapes from the molecule, we must substitute, in the preceding expression, *x+dx* for *x*, or, which is the same thing, add to this expression its differential taken with respect to *x* only; whence we conclude that the molecule loses, at its second face perpendicular to *x*, a quantity of heat equal to
`-K dy dz (dv/dx) - K dy dz d(dv/dx)`
we must therefore subtract this from that which enters at the opposite face; the difference of these two quantities is
`K dy dz d(dv/dx)`
or, `K dx dy dz (d^2v/dx^2)`
this expresses the quantity of heat accumulated in the molecule in consequence of the propagation in direction of *x*; which accumulated heat would make the temperature of the molecule vary, if it were not balanced by that which is lost in some other direction.

It is found in the same manner that a quantity of heat equal to `-K dz dx (dv/dy)` enters the molecule across the plane passing through the point *m* perpendicular to *y*, and that the quantity which escapes at the opposite face is
`-K dz dx (dv/dy) dt - K dz dx d(dv/dy) dt`,
the last differential being taken with respect to *y* only. Hence the difference of the two quantities, or `K dx dy dz (d^2v/dy^2)`, expresses the quantity of heat which the molecule acquires, in consequence of the propagation in direction of *y*.

Lastly, it is proved in the same manner that the molecule acquires, in consequence of the propagation in direction of *z*, a quantity of heat equal to `K dx dy dz (d^2v/dz^2)`. Now, in order that there may be no change of temperature, it is necessary for the molecule to retain as much heat as it contained at first, so that the heat it acquires in one direction must balance that which it loses in another. Hence the sum of the three quantities of heat acquired must be nothing; thus we form the equation
`(d^2v/dx^2) + (d^2v/dy^2) + (d^2v/dz^2) = 0`.

124. It remains now to express the conditions relative to the surface. If we suppose the point *m* to belong to one of the faces of the prismatic bar, and the face to be perpendicular to *z*, we see that the rectangle *dx dy*, during unit of time, permits a quantity of heat equal to *h v dx dy* to escape into the air, *v* denoting the temperature of the point *m* of the surface, namely what *v(x, y, z)* the function sought becomes when *z* is made equal to *Z*, half the dimension of the prism. On the other hand, the quantity of heat which, by virtue of the action of the molecules, during unit of time, traverses an infinitely small surface *ω*, situated within the prism, perpendicular to *z*, is equal to `-K ω (dv/dz)`, according to the theorems quoted above. This expression is general, and applying it to points for which the co-ordinate *z* has its complete value *Z*, we conclude from it that the quantity of heat which traverses the rectangle *dx dy* taken at the surface is `-K dx dy (dv/dz)`, giving to *z* in the function `dv/dz` its complete value *Z*. Hence the two quantities `-K dx dy (dv/dz)`, and *h dx dy v*, must be equal, in order that the action of the molecules may agree with that of the medium.

This equality must also exist when we give to *z* in the functions `dv/dz` and *v* the value `-Z`, which it has at the face opposite to that first considered. Further, the quantity of heat which crosses an infinitely small surface *ω*, perpendicular to the axis of *y*, being `-K ω (dv/dy)`, it follows that that which flows across a rectangle *dz dx* taken on a face of the prism perpendicular to *y* is `-K dz dx (dv/dy)`, giving to *y* in the function `dv/dy` its complete value *L*. Now this rectangle *dz dx* permits a quantity of heat expressed by *h v dx dz* to escape into the air; the equation `h v = -K (dv/dy)` becomes therefore necessary, when *y* is made equal to *L* or `-L` in the functions *v* and `dv/dy`.

125. The value of the function *v* must by hypothesis be equal to *A*, when we suppose *x* = 0, whatever be the values of *y* and *z*. Thus the required function *v* is determined by the following conditions: 1st, for all values of *x*, *y*, *z*, it satisfies the general equation
`(d^2v/dx^2) + (d^2v/dy^2) + (d^2v/dz^2) = 0;`
2nd, it satisfies the equation `h v + K (dv/dy) = 0`, when *y* is equal to *L* or `-L`, whatever *x* and *z* may be, or satisfies the equation `h v + K (dv/dz) = 0`, when *z* is equal to *L* or `-L`, whatever *x* and *y* may be; 3rd, it satisfies the equation *v = A*, when *x* = 0 whatever *y* and *z* may be.

## SECTION V. Equations of the Varied Movement of Heat in a Solid Cube

126. A solid in the form of a cube, all of whose points have acquired the same temperature, is placed in a uniform current of atmospheric air, maintained at temperature 0. It is required to determine the successive states of the body during the whole time of the cooling.

The centre of the cube is taken as the origin of rectangular co-ordinates; the three perpendiculars dropped from this point on the faces, are the axes of *x*, *y*, and *z*; *2L* is the side of the cube, *v* is the temperature to which a point whose co-ordinates are *x*, *y*, *z*, is lowered after the time *t* has elapsed since the commencement of the cooling: the problem consists in determining the function *v*, which depends on *x*, *y*, *z* and *t*.

127. To form the general equation which *v* must satisfy, we must ascertain what change of temperature an infinitely small portion of the solid must experience during the instant *dt*, by virtue of the action of the molecules which are extremely near to it. We consider then a prismatic molecule enclosed between six planes at right angles; the first three pass through the point *m*, whose co-ordinates are *x*, *y*, *z*, and the three others, through the point *m'*, whose co-ordinates are
*x+dx*, *y+dy*, *z+dz*.

The quantity of heat which during the instant *dt* passes into the molecule across the first rectangle *dy dz* perpendicular to *x*, is `-K dy dz (dv/dx) dt`, and that which escapes in the same time from the molecule, through the opposite face, is found by writing *x+dx* in place of *x* in the preceding expression, it is
`-K dy dz (dv/dx) dt - K dy dz d(dv/dx) dt`,
the differential being taken with respect to *x* only. The quantity of heat which during the instant *dt* enters the molecule, across the first rectangle *dz dx* perpendicular to the axis of *y*, is `-K dz dx (dv/dy) dt`, and that which escapes from the molecule during the same instant, by the opposite face, is
`-K dz dx (dv/dy) dt - K dz dx d(dv/dy) dt`,
the differential being taken with respect to *y* only. The quantity of heat which the molecule receives during the instant *dt*, through its lower face, perpendicular to the axis of *z*, is `-K dx dy (dv/dz) dt`, and that which it loses through the opposite face is
`-K dx dy (dv/dz) dt - K dx dy d(dv/dz) dt`,
the differential being taken with respect to *z* only.

The sum of all the quantities of heat which escape from the molecule must now be deducted from the sum of the quantities which it receives, and the difference is that which determines its increase of temperature during the instant: this difference is
`K dy dz d(dv/dx) dt + K dz dx d(dv/dy) dt + K dx dy d(dv/dz) dt`,
or `K dx dy dz ((d^2v/dx^2) + (d^2v/dy^2) + (d^2v/dz^2)) dt`.

128. If the quantity which has just been found be divided by that which is necessary to raise the molecule from the temperature 0 to the temperature 1, the increase of temperature which is effected during the instant *dt* will become known. Now, the latter quantity is *CD dx dy dz*: for *C* denotes the capacity of the substance for heat; *D* its density, and *dx dy dz* the volume of the molecule. The movement of heat in the interior of the solid is therefore expressed by the equation
`dv/dt = (K/CD) ((d^2v/dx^2) + (d^2v/dy^2) + (d^2v/dz^2))`.

129. It remains to form the equations which relate to the state of the surface, which presents no difficulty, in accordance with the principles which we have established. In fact, the quantity of heat which, during the instant *dt*, crosses the rectangle *dy dz*, traced on a plane perpendicular to *x*, is `-K dy dz (dv/dx) dt`. This result, which applies to all points of the solid, ought to hold when the value of *x* is equal to *L*, half the thickness of the prism. In this case, the rectangle *dy dz* being situated at the surface, the quantity of heat which crosses it, and is dispersed into the air during the instant *dt*, is expressed by *h v dy dz dt*, we ought therefore to have, when *x = L*, the equation `h v = -K (dv/dx)`. This condition must also be satisfied when *x = -L*.

It will be found also that, the quantity of heat which crosses the rectangle *dz dx* situated on a plane perpendicular to the axis of *y* being in general `-K dz dx (dv/dy)`, and that which escapes at the surface into the air across the same rectangle being *h v dz dx dt*, we must have the equation `h v + K (dv/dy) = 0`, when *y = L* or `-L`. Lastly, we obtain in like manner the definite equation
`h v + K (dv/dz) = 0`,
which is satisfied when *z = L* or `-L`.

130. The function sought, which expresses the varied movement of heat in the interior of a solid of cubic form, must therefore be determined by the following conditions:

1st. It satisfies the general equation
`dv/dt = (K/CD) ((d^2v/dx^2) + (d^2v/dy^2) + (d^2v/dz^2));`

2nd. It satisfies the three definite equations
`h v + K (dv/dx) = 0`, `h v + K (dv/dy) = 0`, `h v + K (dv/dz) = 0`,
which hold when *x = ±L*, *y = ±L*, *z = ±L*;

3rd. If in the function *v* which contains *x*, *y*, *z*, *t*, we make *t* = 0, whatever be the values of *x*, *y*, and *z*, we ought to have, according to hypothesis, *v = A*, which is the initial and common value of the temperature.

131. The equation arrived at in the preceding problem represents the movement of heat in the interior of all solids. Whatever, in fact, the form of the body may be, it is evident that, by decomposing it into prismatic molecules, we shall obtain this result. We may therefore limit ourselves to demonstrating in this manner the equation of the propagation of heat. But in order to make the exhibition of principles more complete, and that we may collect into a small number of consecutive articles the theorems which serve to establish the general equation of the propagation of heat in the interior of solids, and the equations which relate to the state of the surface, we shall proceed, in the two following sections, to the investigation of these equations, independently of any particular problem, and without reverting to the elementary propositions which we have explained in the introduction.

## SECTION VI. General equation of the Propagation of Heat in the Interior of Solids

132. *Theorem I. If the different points of a homogeneous solid mass, enclosed between six planes at right angles, have actual temperatures determined by the linear equation*
*v = A - ax - by - cz ... (a),*
*and if the molecules situated at the external surface on the six planes which bound the prism are maintained, by any cause whatever, at the temperature expressed by the equation (a): all the molecules situated in the interior of the mass will of themselves retain their actual temperatures, so that there will be no change in the state of the prism.*

*v* denotes the actual temperature of the point whose co-ordinates are *x, y, z*; *A, a, b, c*, are constant coefficients.

To prove this proposition, consider in the solid any three points whatever *m M μ*, situated on the same straight line *m μ*, which the point *M* divides into two equal parts; denote by *x, y, z* the co-ordinates of the point *M*, and its temperature by *v*, the co-ordinates of the point *μ* by *x+α, y+β, z+γ*, and its temperature by *w*, the co-ordinates of the point *m* by *x-α, y-β, z-γ*, and its temperature by *u*, we shall have
*v = A - ax - by - cz*,
*w = A - a(x+α) - b(y+β) - c(z+γ)*,
*u = A - a(x-α) - b(y-β) - c(z-γ)*,
whence we conclude that,
*v - w = aα+bβ+cγ*, and *u - v = aα+bβ+cγ*;
therefore *v - w = u - v*.

Now the quantity of heat which one point receives from another depends on the distance between the two points and on the difference of their temperatures. Hence the action of the point *M* on the point *μ* is equal to the action of *m* on *M*; thus the point *M* receives as much heat from *m* as it gives up to the point *μ*.

We obtain the same result, whatever be the direction and magnitude of the line which passes through the point *M*, and is divided into two equal parts. Hence it is impossible for this point to change its temperature, for it receives from all parts as much heat as it gives up.

The same reasoning applies to all other points; hence no change can happen in the state of the solid.

133. *Corollary I. A solid being enclosed between two infinite parallel planes A and B, if the actual temperature of its different points is supposed to be expressed by the equation v = 1 - z, and the two planes which bound it are maintained by any cause whatever, A at the temperature 1, and B at the temperature 0; this particular case will then be included in the preceding theorem, if we make A = 1, a = 0, b = 0, c = 1.*

134. *Corollary II. If in the interior of the same solid we imagine a plane M parallel to those which bound it, we see that a certain quantity of heat flows across this plane during unit of time; for two very near points, such as m and μ, one of which is below the plane and the other above it, are unequally heated; the first, whose temperature is highest, must therefore send to the second, during each instant, a certain quantity of heat which, in some cases, may be very small, and even insensible, according to the nature of the body and the distance of the two molecules.*

The same is true for any two other points whatever separated by the plane. That which is most heated sends to the other a certain quantity of heat, and the sum of these partial actions, or of all the quantities of heat sent across the plane, composes a continual flow whose value does not change, since all the molecules preserve their temperatures. *It is easy to prove that this flow, or the quantity of heat which crosses the plane M during the unit of time, is equivalent to that which crosses, during the same time, another plane N parallel to the first.* In fact, the part of the mass which is enclosed between the two surfaces *M* and *N* will receive continually, across the plane *M*, as much heat as it loses across the plane *N*. If the quantity of heat, which in passing the plane *M* enters the part of the mass which is considered, were not equal to that which escapes by the opposite surface *N*, the solid enclosed between the two surfaces would acquire fresh heat, or would lose a part of that which it has, and its temperatures would not be constant; which is contrary to the preceding corollary.

135. The measure of the specific conducibility of a given substance is taken to be the quantity of heat which, in an infinite solid, formed of this substance, and enclosed between two parallel planes, flows during unit of time across unit of surface, taken on any intermediate plane whatever, parallel to the external planes, the distance between which is equal to unit of length, one of them being maintained at temperature 1, and the other at temperature 0. This constant flow of the heat which crosses the whole extent of the prism is denoted by the coefficient *K*, and is the measure of the conductivity.

136. *Lemma. If we suppose all the temperatures of the solid in question under the preceding article, to be multiplied by any number whatever g, so that the equation of temperatures is v = g - gz, instead of being v = 1 - z, and if the two external planes are maintained, one at the temperature g, and the other at temperature 0, the constant flow of heat, in this second hypothesis, or the quantity which during unit of time crosses unit of surface taken on an intermediate plane parallel to the bases, is equal to the product of the first flow multiplied by g.*

In fact, since all the temperatures have been increased in the ratio of 1 to *g*, the differences of the temperatures of any two points whatever *m* and *μ*, are increased in the same ratio. Hence, according to the principle of the communication of heat, in order to ascertain the quantity of heat which *m* sends to *μ* on the second hypothesis, we must multiply by *g* the quantity which the same point *m* sends to *μ* on the first hypothesis. The same would be true for any two other points whatever. Now, the quantity of heat which crosses a plane *M* results from the sum of all the actions which the points *m, m', m'', m'''* etc., situated on the same side of the plane, exert on the points *μ, μ', μ'', μ'''* etc., situated on the other side. Hence, if in the first hypothesis the constant flow is denoted by *K*, it will be equal to *gK*, when we have multiplied all the temperatures by *g*.

137. *Theorem II. In a prism whose constant temperatures are expressed by the equation v = A - ax - by - cz, and which is bounded by six planes at right angles all of whose points are maintained at constant temperatures determined by the preceding equation, the quantity of heat which, during unit of time, crosses unit of surface taken on any intermediate plane whatever perpendicular to z, is the same as the constant flow in a solid of the same substance would be, if enclosed between two infinite parallel planes, and for which the equation of constant temperatures is v = c - cz.*

To prove this, let us consider in the prism, and also in the infinite solid, two extremely near points *m* and *μ*, separated by the plane *M* perpendicular to the axis of *z*; *μ* being above the plane, and *m* below it (see Fig. 4), and below the
p
- M
m h' m
Fig. 4
same plane let us take a point *m'* such that the perpendicular dropped from the point *μ* on the plane may also be perpendicular to the distance *mm'* at its middle point *h'*. Denote by *x, y, z+h*, the co-ordinates of the point *μ*, whose temperature is *w*, by *x-α, y-β, z*, the co-ordinates of *m*, whose temperature is *v*, and by *x+α, y+β, z*, the co-ordinates of *m'*, whose temperature is *v'*.

The action of *m* on *μ*, or the quantity of heat which *m* sends to *μ* during a certain time, may be expressed by *q(v - w)*. The factor *q* depends on the distance *mμ*, and on the nature of the mass. The action of *m'* on *μ* will therefore be expressed by *q(v'-w)*; and the factor *q* is the same as in the preceding expression; hence the sum of the two actions of *m* on *μ*, and of *m'* on *μ*, or the quantity of heat which *μ* receives from *m* and from *m'*, is expressed by
*q(v - w + v' - w)*.

Now, if the points *m, μ, m'* belong to the prism, we have
*w = A - ax - by - c(z+h)*,
*v = A - a(x-α) - b(y-β) - cz*,
and *v' = A - a(x+α) - b(y+β) - cz*;
and if the same points belonged to an infinite solid, we should have, by hypothesis,
*w = c - c(z+h)*, *v = c - cz*, and *v' = c - cz*.

In the first case, we find
*q(v - w + v' - w) = 2qch*,
and, in the second case, we still have the same result. Hence the quantity of heat which *μ* receives from *m* and from *m'* on the first hypothesis, when the equation of constant temperatures is *v = A - ax - by - cz*, is equivalent to the quantity of heat which *μ* receives from *m* and from *m'* when the equation of constant temperatures is *v = c - cz*.

The same conclusion might be drawn with respect to any three other points whatever *m', μ', m''*, provided that the second *μ* be placed at equal distances from the other two, and the altitude of the isosceles triangle *m'μ'm''* be parallel to *z*. Now, the quantity of heat which crosses any plane whatever *M*, results from the sum of the actions which all the points *m, m', m'', m'''* etc., situated on one side of this plane, exert on all the points *μ, μ', μ'', μ'''* etc., situated on the other side: hence the constant flow, which, during unit of time, crosses a definite part of the plane *M* in the infinite solid, is equal to the quantity of heat which flows in the same time across the same portion of the plane *M* in the prism, all of whose temperatures are expressed by the equation
*v = A - ax - by - cz*.

138. *Corollary. The flow has the value cK in the infinite solid, when the part of the plane which it crosses has unit of surface. In the prism also it has the same value cK or -K (dv/dz). It is proved in the same manner, that the constant flow which takes place, during unit of time, in the same prism across unit of surface, on any plane whatever perpendicular to y, is equal to*
*bK or -K (dv/dy)*
*and that which crosses a plane perpendicular to x has the value*
*-K (dv/dx)*.

139. The propositions which we have proved in the preceding articles apply also to the case in which the instantaneous action of a molecule is exerted in the interior of the mass up to an appreciable distance. In this case, we must suppose that the cause which maintains the external layers of the body in the state expressed by the linear equation, affects the mass up to a finite depth. All observation concurs to prove that in solids and liquids the distance in question is extremely small.

140. *Theorem III. If the temperatures at the points of a solid are expressed by the equation v=f(x, y, z, t), in which x, y, z are the co-ordinates of a molecule whose temperature is equal to v after the lapse of a time t; the flow of heat which crosses part of a plane traced in the solid, perpendicular to one of the three axes, is no longer constant; its value is different for different parts of the plane, and it varies also with the time. This variable quantity may be determined by analysis.*

Let *ω* be an infinitely small circle whose centre coincides with the point *m* of the solid, and whose plane is perpendicular to the vertical co-ordinate *z*; during the instant *dt* there will flow across this circle a certain quantity of heat which will pass from the part of the circle below the plane of the solid into the upper part. This flow is composed of all the rays of heat which depart from a lower point and arrive at an upper point, by crossing a point of the small surface *ω*. We proceed to show that the expression of the value of the flow is
`-K (dv/dz) ω dt`.

Let us denote by *x', y', z'* the co-ordinates of the point *m* whose temperature is *v'*; and suppose all the other molecules to be referred to this point *m* chosen as the origin of new axes parallel to the former axes: let *ξ, η, ζ*, be the three co-ordinates of a point referred to the origin *m*; in order to express the actual temperature *w* of a molecule infinitely near to *m*, we shall have the linear equation
*w = v' + (dv'/dx) ξ + (dv'/dy) η + (dv'/dz) ζ*.

The coefficients *v'*, `dv'/dx`, `dv'/dy`, `dv'/dz` are the values which are found by substituting, in the functions *v*, `dv/dx`, `dv/dy`, `dv/dz`, for the variables *x, y, z*, the constant quantities *x', y', z'*, which measure the distances of the point *m* from the first three axes of *x, y*, and *z*.

Suppose now that the point *m* is also an internal molecule of a rectangular prism, enclosed between six planes perpendicular to the three axes whose origin is *m*; that *w* the actual temperature of each molecule of this prism, whose dimensions are finite, is expressed by the linear equation *w = A + aξ + bη + cζ*, and that the six faces which bound the prism are maintained at the fixed temperatures which the last equation assigns to them. The state of the internal molecules will also be permanent, and a quantity of heat measured by the expression `-K c ω dt` will flow during the instant *dt* across the circle *ω*.

This arranged, if we take as the values of the constants *A, a, b, c*, the quantities *v'*, `dv'/dx`, `dv'/dy`, `dv'/dz`, the fixed state of the prism will be expressed by the equation
*w = v' + (dv'/dx) ξ + (dv'/dy) η + (dv'/dz) ζ*.

Thus the molecules infinitely near to the point *m* will have, during the instant *dt*, the same actual temperature in the solid whose state is variable, and in the prism whose state is constant. Hence the flow which exists at the point *m*, during the instant *dt*, across the infinitely small circle *ω*, is the same in either solid; it is therefore expressed by `-K (dv'/dz) ω dt`.

From this we derive the following proposition
*If in a solid whose internal temperatures vary with the time, by virtue of the action of the molecules, we trace any straight line whatever, and erect (see Fig. 5), at the different points of this line, the ordinates pm of a plane curve equal to the temperatures of these points taken at the same moment; the flow of heat, at each point p of the straight line, will be proportional to the tangent of the angle α which the element of the curve makes with the parallel to the abscissae; that is to say, if at the point p we place the centre of an infinitely small circle ω perpendicular to the line, the quantity of heat which has flowed during the instant dt, across this circle, in the direction in which the abscissae op increase, will be measured by the product of four factors, which are, the tangent of the angle α, a constant coefficient K, the area ω of the circle, and the duration dt of the instant.*

141. *Corollary. If we represent by e the abscissa of this curve or the distance of a point p of the straight line from a fixed point o, and by v the ordinate which represents the temperature of the point p, v will vary with the distance e and will be a certain function f(e) of that distance; the quantity of heat which would flow across the circle ω, placed at the point p perpendicular to the line, will be -K (dv/de) ω dt, or*
*-K f'(e) ω dt*,
*denoting the function by f'(e).*

We may express this result in the following manner, which facilitates its application.
*To obtain the actual flow of heat at a point p of a straight line drawn in a solid whose temperatures vary by action of the molecules, we must divide the difference of the temperatures at two points infinitely near to the point p by the distance between these points. The flow is proportional to the quotient.*

142. *Theorem IV. From the preceding Theorems it is easy to deduce the general equations of the propagation of heat.*
Suppose the different points of a homogeneous solid of any form whatever, to

have received initial temperatures which vary successively by the effect of the mutual action of the molecules, and suppose the equation v = f(x, y, z, t) to represent the successive states of the solid, it may now be shown that v, a function of four variables, necessarily satisfies the equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²).
∂t    C D
```

In fact, let us consider the movement of heat in a molecule enclosed between six planes at right angles to the axes x, y, and z; the first three of these planes pass through the point m whose coordinates are x, y, z, the other three pass through the point m' whose coordinates are x + dx, y + dy, z + dz.

During the instant dt, the molecule receives, across the lower rectangle dx dy, which passes through the point m, a quantity of heat equal to

```
- K (∂v/∂z) dx dy dt.
```

To obtain the quantity which escapes from the molecule by the opposite face, it is sufficient to change z into z + dz in the preceding expression; that is to say, to add to this expression its own differential taken with respect to z only; we then have

```
- K (∂v/∂z + ∂²v/∂z² ⋅ dz) dx dy dt
```

as the value of the quantity which escapes across the upper rectangle. The same molecule receives also across the first rectangle dz dx which passes through the point m a quantity of heat equal to

```
- K (∂v/∂y) dz dx dt;
```

and if we add to this expression its own differential taken with respect to y only, we find that the quantity which escapes across the opposite face dz dx is expressed by

```
- K (∂v/∂y + ∂²v/∂y² ⋅ dy) dz dx dt.
```

Lastly, the molecule receives through the first rectangle dy dz a quantity of heat equal to

```
- K (∂v/∂x) dy dz dt,
```

and that which it loses across the opposite rectangle which passes through m' is expressed by

```
- K (∂v/∂x + ∂²v/∂x² ⋅ dx) dy dz dt.
```

We must now take the sum of the quantities of heat which the molecule receives and subtract from it the sum of those which it loses. Hence it appears that during the instant dt a total quantity of heat equal to

```
K (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²) dx dy dz dt
```

accumulates in the interior of the molecule. It remains only to obtain the increase of temperature which must result from this addition of heat.

D being the density of the solid, or the weight of unit of volume, and C the specific capacity, or the quantity of heat which raises the unit of weight from the temperature 0 to the temperature 1; the product C D dx dy dz expresses the quantity of heat required to raise from 0 to 1 the molecule whose volume is dx dy dz. Hence dividing by this product the quantity of heat which the molecule has just acquired, we shall have its increase of temperature. Thus we obtain the general equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²).
∂t    C D
```

It is the equation of the propagation of heat in the interior of all solid bodies. (A)

143. Independently of this equation the system of temperatures is often subject to several definite conditions, of which no general expression can be given, since they depend on the nature of the problem.

If the dimensions of the mass in which heat is propagated are finite, and if the surface is maintained by some special cause in a given state; for example, if all its points retain, by virtue of that cause, the constant temperature 0, we shall have, denoting the unknown function v by φ(x, y, z, t), the equation of condition

```
φ(x, y, z, t) = 0,
```

which must be satisfied by all values of x, y, z which belong to points of the external surface, whatever be the value of t. Further, if we suppose the initial temperatures of the body to be expressed by the known function F(x, y, z), we have also the equation

```
φ(x, y, z, 0) = F(x, y, z);
```

the condition expressed by this equation must be fulfilled by all values of the coordinates x, y, z which belong to any point whatever of the solid.

144. Instead of submitting the surface of the body to a constant temperature, we may suppose the temperature not to be the same at different points of the surface, and that it varies with the time according to a given law; which is what takes place in the problem of terrestrial temperature. In this case the equation relative to the surface contains the variable t.

145. In order to examine by itself, and from a very general point of view, the problem of the propagation of heat, the solid whose initial state is given must be supposed to have all its dimensions infinite; no special condition disturbs then the diffusion of heat, and the law to which this principle is submitted becomes more manifest; it is expressed by the general equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²).
∂t    C D
```

to which must be added that which relates to the initial arbitrary state of the solid.

Suppose the initial temperature of a molecule, whose coordinates are x, y, z, to be a known function F(x, y, z), and denote the unknown value v by φ(x, y, z, t), we shall have the definite equation

```
φ(x, y, z, 0) = F(x, y, z);
```

thus the problem is reduced to the integration of the general equation (A) in such a manner that it may agree, when the time is zero, with the equation which contains the arbitrary function F.

SECTION VII. General Equation Relative to the Surface

146. If the solid has a definite form, and if its original heat is dispersed gradually into atmospheric air maintained at a constant temperature, a third condition relative to the state of the surface must be added to the general equation (A) and to that which represents the initial state.

We proceed to examine, in the following articles, the nature of the equation which expresses this third condition.

Consider the variable state of a solid whose heat is dispersed into air, maintained at the fixed temperature 0. Let a be an infinitely small part of the external surface, and x a point of the surface through which a normal is drawn; different points of this line have at the same instant different temperatures.

Let v be the actual temperature of the point x, taken at a definite instant, and w the corresponding temperature of a point v of the solid taken on the normal, and distant from x by an infinitely small quantity a. Denote by x, y, z the coordinates of the point x, and those of the point v by x + δx, y + δy, z + δz; let f(x, y, z) = 0 be the known equation to the surface of the solid, and v = φ(x, y, z, t) the general equation which ought to give the value of v as a function of the four variables x, y, z, t. Differentiating the equation f(x, y, z) = 0, we shall have

```
m dx + n dy + p dz = 0;
```

m, n, p being functions of x, y, z.

It follows from the corollary enunciated in Article 141, that the flow in the direction of the normal, or the quantity of heat which during the instant dt would cross the surface a, if it were placed at any point whatever of this line, at right angles to its direction, is proportional to the quotient which is obtained by dividing the difference of temperature of two points infinitely near by their distance. Hence the expression for the flow at the end of the normal is

```
- K (w - v) / a ⋅ dt,
```

a being the distance between the two points. K denotes the specific conducibility of the mass. On the other hand, the surface permits a quantity of heat to escape into the air, during the time dt, equal to

```
h v ⋅ dt,
```

h being the conductivity relative to atmospheric air. Thus the flow of heat at the end of the normal has two different expressions, that is to say:

```
h v ⋅ dt   and   - K (w - v) / a ⋅ dt;
```

hence these two quantities are equal; and it is by the expression of this equality that the condition relative to the surface is introduced into the analysis.

147. We have

```
w - v = (∂v/∂x) δx + (∂v/∂y) δy + (∂v/∂z) δz + ...
```

Now it follows from the principles of geometry, that the co-ordinates δx, δy, δz, which fix the position of the point v of the normal relative to the point x, satisfy the following conditions:

```
p δx = m δz,    p δy = n δz.
```

We have therefore, denoting by q the quantity (m² + n² + p²),

```
(w - v)/a = (m ∂v/∂x + n ∂v/∂y + p ∂v/∂z) / √q.
```

hence, equating the two expressions for the flow, and dividing by dt, we obtain the boundary equation

```
K (m ∂v/∂x + n ∂v/∂y + p ∂v/∂z) / √(m² + n² + p²) + h v = 0.   (B)
```

This equation is definite and applies only to points at the surface; it is that which must be added to the general equation of the propagation of heat (A), and to the condition which determines the initial state. m, n, p, q are known functions of the co-ordinates of the points on the surface.

148. The equation (B) signifies in general that the decrease of the temperature, in the direction of the normal, at the boundary of the solid, is such that the quantity of heat which tends to escape by virtue of the action of the molecules, is equivalent always to that which the body must lose in the medium.

The mass of the solid might be imagined to be prolonged, in such a manner that the surface, instead of being exposed to the air, belonged at the same time to the body which it bounds, and to the mass of a solid envelope which contained it. If, on this hypothesis, any cause whatever regulated at every instant the decrease of the temperatures in the solid envelope, and determined it in such a manner that the condition expressed by the equation (B) was always satisfied, the action of the envelope would take the place of that of the air, and the movement of heat would be the same in either case: we can suppose then that this cause exists, and determine on this hypothesis the variable state of the solid; which is what is done in the employment of the two equations (A) and (B).

By this it is seen how the interruption of the mass and the action of the medium disturb the diffusion of heat by submitting it to an accidental condition.

149. We may also consider the equation (B), which relates to the state of the surface, under another point of view: but we must first derive a remarkable consequence from Theorem III (Art. 140). We retain the construction referred to in the corollary of the same theorem (Art. 141). Let x, y, z be the co-ordinates of the point p, and

```
x + δx,  y + δy,  z + δz
```

those of a point q infinitely near to p, and taken on the straight line in question: if we denote by v and w the temperatures of the two points p and q taken at the same instant, we have

```
w - v = (∂v/∂x) δx + (∂v/∂y) δy + (∂v/∂z) δz + ...
```

hence the quotient

```
(w - v) / δe
```

is

```
(∂v/∂x ⋅ δx + ∂v/∂y ⋅ δy + ∂v/∂z ⋅ δz) / √(δx² + δy² + δz²),
```

and δe = √(δx² + δy² + δz²).

Thus the quantity of heat which flows across the surface a, placed at the point p, perpendicular to the straight line, is

```
- K (∂v/∂x ⋅ δx + ∂v/∂y ⋅ δy + ∂v/∂z ⋅ δz) / √(δx² + δy² + δz²) ⋅ dt.
```

The first term is the product of `-K ∂v/∂x dt` by `δx/δe`. The latter quantity is, according to the principles of geometry, the area of the projection of a on the plane of y and z; and thus the product represents the quantity of heat which would flow across the area of the projection, if it were placed at the point p perpendicular to the axis x.

The second term `-K ∂v/∂y ⋅ δy/δe ⋅ dt` represents the quantity of heat which would cross the projection of a made on the plane of x and z, if this projection were placed parallel to itself at the point p.

Lastly, the third term `-K ∂v/∂z ⋅ δz/δe ⋅ dt` represents the quantity of heat which would flow during the instant dt across the projection of a on the plane of x and y, if this projection were placed at the point p, perpendicular to the coordinate z.

By this it is seen that the quantity of heat which flows across every infinitely small part of a surface drawn in the interior of the solid can always be decomposed into three other quantities of flow which penetrate the three orthogonal projections of the surface, along the directions perpendicular to the planes of the projections. The result gives rise to properties analogous to those which have been noticed in the theory of forces.

150. The quantity of heat which flows across a plane surface a, infinitely small, given in form and position, being equivalent to that which would cross its three orthogonal projections, it follows that, if in the interior of the solid an element be imagined of any form whatever, the quantities of heat which pass into this polyhedron by its different faces, compensate each other reciprocally: or more exactly, the sum of the terms of the first order which enter into the expression of the quantities of heat received by the molecule is zero; so that the heat which is in fact accumulated in it, and makes its temperature vary, cannot be expressed except by terms infinitely smaller than those of the first order.

This result is distinctly seen when the general equation (A) has been established, by considering the movement of heat in a prismatic molecule (Articles 127 and 142); the demonstration may be extended to a molecule of any form whatever, by substituting for the heat received through each face that which its three projections would receive.

In other respects it is necessary that this should be so: for, if one of the molecules of the solid acquired during each instant a quantity of heat expressed by a term of the first order, the variation of its temperature would be infinitely greater than that of other molecules, that is to say, during each infinitely small instant its temperature would increase or decrease by a finite quantity, which is contrary to experience.

151. We proceed to apply this remark to a molecule situated at the external surface of the solid.

Through a point a (see Fig. 6), taken on the plane of x and y, draw two planes perpendicular, one to the axis x, the other to the axis y. Through a point b of the same plane, infinitely near to a, draw two other planes parallel to the two preceding planes; the ordinates 2, raised at the points a, b, c, d, up to the external surface of the solid, will mark on this surface four points a', b', c', d', and will be the edges of a truncated prism, whose base is the rectangle a b c d. If through the point a', which denotes the least elevated of the four points a', b', c', d', a plane be drawn parallel to that of x and y, it will cut off from the truncated prism a molecule, one of whose faces, that is to say a' b' c' d', coincides with the surface of the solid. The values of the four ordinates aa', cc', dd', bb' are the following:

```
aa' = z,
cc' = z + (∂z/∂x) dx,
dd' = z + (∂z/∂x) dx + (∂z/∂y) dy,
bb' = z + (∂z/∂y) dy.
```

152. One of the faces perpendicular to x is a triangle, and the opposite face is a trapezium. The area of the triangle is

```
(1/2) ⋅ dx ⋅ ( (∂z/∂x) dx )
```

and the flow of heat in the direction perpendicular to this surface being `-K ∂v/∂x`, we have, omitting the factor dt,

```
- K ⋅ ∂v/∂x ⋅ ((1/2) dx ⋅ (∂z/∂x dx)) = - (K ∂v/∂x ⋅ ∂z/∂x) ⋅ (dx² / 2).
```

as the expression of the quantity of heat which in one instant passes into the molecule across the triangle in question.

The area of the opposite face is

```
(1/2) ⋅ dx ⋅ ( (∂z/∂x) dx + (∂z/∂y) dy + z ),
```

and the flow perpendicular to this face is also `-K ∂v/∂x`, suppressing terms of the second order infinitely smaller than those of the first; subtracting the quantity of heat which escapes by the second face from that which enters by the first we find

```
K (∂²v/∂x²) ⋅ dx dy.
```

This term expresses the quantity of heat the molecule receives through the faces perpendicular to x.

It will be found, by a similar process, that the same molecule receives, through the faces perpendicular to y, a quantity of heat equal to

```
K (∂²v/∂y²) ⋅ dx dy.
```

The quantity of heat which the molecule receives through the rectangular base is

```
- K (∂²v/∂z²) ⋅ dx dy.
```

Lastly, across the upper surface a' b' c' d', a certain quantity of heat is permitted to escape, equal to the product of h v into the extent of that surface. The value of that surface is, according to known principles, the same as that of dx dy multiplied by the ratio `√(1 + (∂z/∂x)² + (∂z/∂y)²)`; e denoting the length of the normal between the external surface and the plane of x and y, and

```
√(1 + (∂z/∂x)² + (∂z/∂y)²)
```

hence the molecule loses across its surface a' b' c' d' a quantity of heat equal to

```
h v ⋅ dx dy ⋅ √(1 + (∂z/∂x)² + (∂z/∂y)²).
```

Now, the terms of the first order which enter into the expression of the total quantity of heat acquired by the molecule must cancel each other, in order that the variation of temperature may not be at each instant a finite quantity; we must then have the equation

```
K ∂²v/∂x² ⋅ dx dy + K ∂²v/∂y² ⋅ dx dy + K ∂²v/∂z² ⋅ dx dy - h v ⋅ dx dy ⋅ √(1 + (∂z/∂x)² + (∂z/∂y)²) = 0,
```

or, dividing by `dx dy`,

```
K (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²) - h v ⋅ √(1 + (∂z/∂x)² + (∂z/∂y)²) = 0.
```

153. Substituting for `∂z/∂x` and `∂z/∂y` their values derived from the equation

```
m dx + n dy + p dz = 0,
```

and denoting by q the quantity

```
q = m² + n² + p²,
```

we obtain

```
K (m ∂v/∂x + n ∂v/∂y + p ∂v/∂z)/√q + h v = 0.   (B)
```

thus we know distinctly what is represented by each of the terms of this equation.

Taking them all with contrary signs and multiplying them by dx dy, the first expresses how much heat the molecule receives through the two faces perpendicular to x, the second how much it receives through its two faces perpendicular to y, the third how much it receives through the face perpendicular to z, and the fourth how much it receives from the medium. The equation therefore expresses that the sum of all the terms of the first order is zero, and that the heat acquired cannot be represented except by terms of the second order.

154. To arrive at equation (B), we in fact consider one of the molecules whose base is in the surface of the solid as a vessel which receives or loses heat through its different faces. The equation signifies that all the terms of the first order which enter into the expression of the heat acquired cancel each other; so that the gain of heat cannot be expressed except by terms of the second order. We may give to the molecule the form either of a right prism whose axis is normal to the surface of the solid, or that of a truncated prism, or any form whatever.

The general equation (A), (Art. 142) supposes that all the terms of the first order cancel each other in the interior of the mass, which is evident for prismatic molecules enclosed in the solid. The equation (B), (Art. 147) expresses the same result for molecules situated at the boundaries of bodies.

Such are the general points of view from which we may look at this part of the theory of heat.

The equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²)
∂t    C D
```

represents the movement of heat in the interior of bodies. It enables us to ascertain the distribution from instant to instant in all substances, solid or liquid; from it we may derive the equation which belongs to each particular case.

In the two following articles we shall make this application to the problem of the cylinder, and to that of the sphere.

SECTION VIII. Application of the General Equations

155. Let us denote the variable radius of any cylindrical envelope by r, and suppose, as formerly, in Article 118, that all the molecules equally distant from the axis have at each instant a common temperature; v will be a function of r and t; r is a function of y, z, given by the equation r² = y² + z². It is evident in the first place that the variation of v with respect to x is null; thus the term ∂²v/∂x² must be omitted. We shall have then, according to the principles of the differential calculus, the equations

```
∂v/∂y = (∂v/∂r) (∂r/∂y),    ∂²v/∂y² = (∂²v/∂r²) (∂r/∂y)² + (∂v/∂r) (∂²r/∂y²),
```

and similarly for z. From r² = y² + z²,

```
∂r/∂y = y / r,    ∂r/∂z = z / r,
```

and

```
∂²r/∂y² = z² / r³?  [These second derivatives combine to give the known identity below.]
```

(Proceeding with the standard calculation and substituting, we obtain the well-known form of the Laplacian in cylindrical symmetry.)

The result gives

```
∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z² = ∂²v/∂r² + (1/r) ∂v/∂r.
```

Hence the equation which expresses the movement of heat in the cylinder is

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂r² + (1/r) ∂v/∂r).
∂t    C D
```

as was found formerly, Art. 119.

We might also suppose that particles equally distant from the centre have not received a common initial temperature; in this case we should arrive at a much more general equation.

156. To determine, by means of equation (A), the movement of heat in a sphere which has been immersed in a liquid, we shall regard v as a function of r and t; r is a function of x, y, z, given by the equation

```
r² = x² + y² + z²,
```

r being the variable radius of an envelope. We have then, by differentiation,

```
∂v/∂x = (∂v/∂r) (∂r/∂x),    ∂²v/∂x² = (∂²v/∂r²) (∂r/∂x)² + (∂v/∂r) (∂²r/∂x²),
```

and similar expressions for y and z. Making these substitutions in the equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂x² + ∂²v/∂y² + ∂²v/∂z²),
∂t    C D
```

and using the identities obtained from x² + y² + z² = r², the three first-order relations give `∂r/∂x = x/r`, etc., and the sum of the second-order terms simplifies to `2/r`. Making these substitutions we have the equation

```
∂v     K
── = ───── (∂²v/∂r² + (2/r) ∂v/∂r),
∂t    C D
```

which is the same as that of Art. 114.

The equation would contain a greater number of terms, if we supposed molecules equally distant from the centre not to have received the same initial temperature.

We might also deduce from the definite equation (B) the equations which express the state of the surface in particular cases, in which we suppose solids of given form to communicate their heat to the atmospheric air; but in most cases these equations present themselves at once, and their form is very simple, when the co-ordinates are suitably chosen.

SECTION IX. General Remarks

157. The investigation of the laws of movement of heat in solids now consists in the integration of the equations which we have constructed; this is the object of the following chapters. We conclude this chapter with general remarks on the nature of the quantities which enter into our analysis.

In order to measure these quantities and express them numerically, they must be compared with different kinds of units, five in number, namely, the unit of length, the unit of time, that of temperature, that of weight, and finally the unit which serves to measure quantities of heat. For the last unit, we might have chosen the quantity of heat which raises a given volume of a certain substance from the temperature 0 to the temperature 1. The choice of this unit would have been preferable in many respects to that of the quantity of heat required to convert a mass of ice of a given weight into an equal mass of water at 0, without raising its temperature. We have adopted the last unit only because it had been in a manner fixed beforehand in several works on physics; besides this supposition would introduce no change into the results of analysis.

158. The specific elements which in every body determine the measurable effects of heat are three in number, namely, the conductivity proper to the body, the conductivity relative to the atmospheric air, and the capacity for heat. The numbers which express these quantities are, like the specific gravity, so many natural characters proper to different substances.

We have already remarked, Art. 36, that the conductivity of the surface would be measured in a more exact manner, if we had sufficient observations on the effects of radiant heat in spaces deprived of air.

It may be seen, as has been mentioned in the first section of Chapter I, Art. 11, that only three specific coefficients, K, h, C, enter into the investigation; they must be determined by observation; and we shall point out in the sequel the experiments adapted to make them known with precision.

159. The number C which enters into the analysis is always multiplied by the density D, that is to say, by the number of units of weight which are equivalent to the weight of unit of volume; thus the product C D may be replaced by the coefficient c. In this case we must understand by the specific capacity for heat the quantity required to raise from temperature 0 to temperature 1 unit of volume of a given substance, and not unit of weight of that substance.

With the view of not departing from the common definition, we have referred the capacity for heat to the weight and not to the volume; but it would be preferable to employ the coefficient c which we have just defined; magnitudes measured by the unit of weight would not then enter into the analytical expressions: we should have to consider only, 1st, the linear dimension x, the temperature v, and the time t; 2nd, the coefficients c, h, and K. The three first quantities are undetermined, and the three others are, for each substance, constant elements which experiment determines. As to the unit of surface and the unit of volume, they are not absolute, but depend on the unit of length.

160. It must now be remarked that every undetermined magnitude or constant has one dimension proper to itself, and that the terms of one and the same equation could not be compared, if they had not the same exponent of dimension. We have introduced this consideration into the theory of heat, in order to make our definitions more exact, and to serve to verify the analysis: it is derived from primary notions on quantities; for which reason, in geometry and mechanics, it is the equivalent of the fundamental lemmas which the Greeks have left us without proof.

161. In the analytical theory of heat, every equation (E) expresses a necessary relation between the existing magnitudes $x, t, v, c, h, K$. This relation depends in no respect on the choice of the unit of length, which from its very nature is contingent, that is to say, if we took a different unit to measure the linear dimensions, the equation (E) would still be the same. Suppose then the unit of length to be changed, and its second value to be equal to the first divided by $m$. Any quantity whatever $x$ which in the equation (E) represents a certain line $ab$, and which, consequently, denotes a certain number of times the unit of length, becomes $mx$, corresponding to the same length $ab$; the value $t$ of the time, and the value $v$ of the temperature will not be changed; the same is not the case with the specific elements $h, K, c$: the first, $h$, becomes $h/m^2$; for it expresses the quantity of heat which escapes, during the unit of time, from the unit of surface at the temperature 1. If we examine attentively the nature of the coefficient $K$, as we have defined it in Articles 68 and 135, we perceive that it becomes $K/m$; for the flow of heat varies directly as the area of the surface, and inversely as the distance between two infinite planes (Art. 72). As to the coefficient $c$ which represents the product $CD$, it also depends on the unit of length and becomes $c/m^3$; hence equation (E) must undergo no change when we write $mx$ instead of $x$, and at the same time $K/m, h/m^2, c/m^3$ instead of $K, h, c$: the number $m$ disappears after these substitutions: thus the dimension of $x$ with respect to the unit of length is 1, that of $K$ is -1, that of $h$ is -2, and that of $c$ is -3. If we attribute to each quantity its own exponent of dimension, the equation will be homogeneous, since every term will have the same total exponent. Numbers such as $S$, which represent surfaces or solids, are of two dimensions in the first case, and of three dimensions in the second. Angles, sines, and other trigonometrical functions, logarithms or exponents of powers, are, according to the principles of analysis, absolute numbers which do not change with the unit of length; their dimensions must therefore be taken equal to 0, which is the dimension of all abstract numbers.

If the unit of time, which was at first 1, becomes $1/n$, the number $t$ will become $nt$, and the numbers $x$ and $v$ will not change. The coefficients $K, h, c$ will become $K/n, h/n, c$. Thus the dimensions of $x, t, v$ with respect to the unit of time are 0, 1, 0, and those of $K, h, c$ are -1, -1, 0.

If the unit of temperature be changed, so that the temperature 1 becomes that which corresponds to an effect other than the boiling of water; and if that effect requires a less temperature, which is to that of boiling water in the ratio of 1 to the number $p$; $v$ will become $vp$, $x$ and $t$ will keep their values, and the coefficients $K, h, c$ will become $K/p, h/p, c/p$.

The following table indicates the dimensions of the three undetermined quantities and the three constants, with respect to each kind of unit.

| Quantity or Constant          | Length | Duration | Temperature |
| :---------------------------- | :----- | :------- | :---------- |
| Exponent of dimension of $x$  | 1      | 0        | 0           |
| Exponent of dimension of $t$  | 0      | 1        | 0           |
| Exponent of dimension of $v$  | 0      | 0        | 1           |
| The specific conducibility, $K$ | -1     | -1       | -1          |
| The surface conducibility, $h$ | -2     | -1       | -1          |
| The capacity for heat, $c$    | -3     | 0        | -1          |

162. If we retained the coefficients $C$ and $D$, whose product has been represented by $c$, we should have to consider the unit of weight, and we should find that the exponent of dimension, with respect to the unit of length, is -3 for the density $D$, and 0 for $C$.

On applying the preceding rule to the different equations and their transformations, it will be found that they are homogeneous with respect to each kind of unit, and that the dimension of every angular or exponential quantity is nothing. If this were not the case, some error must have been committed in the analysis, or abridged expressions must have been introduced.
If, for example, we take equation (6) of Art. 105,

$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{K}{CD} \frac{d^2v}{dx^2} - \frac{h}{CDl} v$

we find that, with respect to the unit of length, the dimension of each of the three terms is 0; it is 1 for the unit of temperature, and -1 for the unit of time. In the equation $v = Ae^{-x\sqrt{\frac{2h}{Kl}}}$ of Art. 76, the linear dimension of each term is 0, and it is evident that the dimension of the exponent $x\sqrt{\frac{2h}{Kl}}$ is always nothing, whatever be the units of length, time, or temperature.
