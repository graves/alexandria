# Volume 45 - Lavoisier, Fourier, Faraday

## ANTOINE LAURENT LAVOISIER (1743-1794)

Lavoisier was a French nobleman and chemist, widely considered the father of modern chemistry. He established the law of conservation of mass, named oxygen and hydrogen, and helped construct the metric system. He was executed during the French Revolution.

### Works in This Volume

- **Elements of Chemistry** - Lavoisier's revolutionary treatise that transformed chemistry from an empirical craft into a rigorous science. He introduced systematic chemical nomenclature, established the role of oxygen in combustion, and demolished the phlogiston theory.

## JEAN BAPTISTE JOSEPH FOURIER (1768-1830)

Fourier was a French mathematician and physicist best known for initiating the study of Fourier series and their application to problems of heat transfer and vibration. His mathematical methods are fundamental to modern physics and engineering.

### Works in This Volume

- **Analytical Theory of Heat** - Fourier's masterwork on heat conduction, introducing the mathematical techniques now known as Fourier analysis. His methods for representing functions as sums of trigonometric series became essential tools across mathematics and physics.

## MICHAEL FARADAY (1791-1867)

Faraday was an English scientist who made fundamental contributions to electromagnetism and electrochemistry. Despite limited formal education, he became one of the most influential scientists in history, discovering electromagnetic induction and establishing the field concept in physics.

### Works in This Volume

- **Experimental Researches in Electricity** - Faraday's collected papers documenting his groundbreaking experiments on electricity and magnetism. These researches established the principles of electromagnetic induction, electrochemistry, and the relationship between light and magnetism.
