## GEORGE BERKELEY (1685-1753)

Berkeley was an Irish philosopher and Anglican bishop, known for his idealist philosophy. He argued that material objects exist only as perceptions in the mind, famously summarized as *"esse est percipi"* (to be is to be perceived).

### Works in This Volume

- **The Principles of Human Knowledge** - Berkeley's main philosophical work, arguing that matter does not exist independently of perception. All we know are our own ideas, and objects exist only insofar as they are perceived by minds.
