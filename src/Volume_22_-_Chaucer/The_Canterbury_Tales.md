> When April with his showers sweet with fruit  
> The drought of March has pierced unto the root,  
> And bathed each vein with liquor that has power  
> To generate therein and sire the flower;  
> When Zephyrus also has, with his sweet breath,  
> Quickened again, in every holt and heath,  
> The tender shoots and buds, and the young sun  
> Into the Ram one half his course has run,  
> And many little birds make melody  
> That sleep through all the night with open eye  
> (So Nature pricks them on to ramp and rage) —  
> Then do folk long to go on pilgrimage,  
> And palmers to go seeking out strange strands,  
> To distant shrines well known in sundry lands;  
> And specially, from every shire’s end  
> Of England they to Canterbury wend,  
> The holy blessed martyr there to seek  
> Who helped them when that they were sick and weak.  
> Befell that, in that season, on a day,  
> In Southwark at the Tabard as I lay,  
> Ready to start upon my pilgrimage  
> To Canterbury with full devout courage,  
> There came at night into that hostelry  
> Some nine and twenty in a company,  
> Of sundry folk by chance together falle,  
> In fellowship, and pilgrims were they all,  
> That toward Canterbury would ride;  
> The chambers and the stables were wide,  
> And well we were provided at the best.  
> And shortly, when the sun was set and ceased,  
> So had I spoken with them, every one,  
> That I was of their fellowship anon,  
> And made accord to rise up early there  
> To take our way, as I shall you declare.  
> But nevertheless, while I have time and space,  
> Ere that I further in this tale pace,  
> It seems to me accordant with reason  
> To tell you all the condition  
> Of each of them, as it appeared to me,  
> And who they were, and of what degree,  
> And even how arrayed they were in sort:  
> And with a knight then will I first report.

### KNIGHT

> A sheef of pecok-arwes bright and kene  
> Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;

### THE PRIORESS

> Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse,  
> That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy,  
> Hir greeteste ooth was but by Seint Eloy;  
> And she was cleped Madame Eglentyne.  
> Ful wel she song the service devyne,  
> Entuned in hir nose ful semely;  
> And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,  
> After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,  
> For Frensh of Pariss was to hir unknowe.  
> At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;  
> She let no morsel from hir lippes falle,  
> Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.  
> Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,  
> That no drope ne fille upon hir brest.  
> In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest.  
> Hir over lippe wiped she so clene,  
> That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene  
> Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.  
> Ful semely after hir mete she raughte.  
> And sikerly she was of greet disport,  
> And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,  
> And peyned hir to countrefete chere  
> Of court, and been estatlich of manere,  
> And to ben holden digne of reverence.  
> But, for to speken of hir conscience,  
> She was so charitable and so pitous,  
> She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous  
> Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.  
> Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde  
> With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.  
> But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,  
> Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:  
> And al was conscience and tendre herte.  
> Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;  
> Hir nose tretys, hir eyen greye as glas;  
> Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed,  
> But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;  
> It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;  
> For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.  
> Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.  
> Of smal coral about hir arm she bar  
> A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;  
> And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene;  
> On which ther was first write a crowned A,  
> And after, Amor vincit omnia.

> Ther was also another Nonne with hir,  
> That was hir chapellein, and preestes three.  
> A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie,  
> An out-rydere that lovede venerye;  
> A manly man, to been an abbot able.  
> Ful many a deynté hors hadde he in stable;  
> And whan he rood, men mighte his bridel heere  
> Ginglen in a whistling wynd as cleer,  
> And eek as loude as dooth the chapel belle  
> Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.  
> The reule of seint Maure or seint Beneit,  
> Bycause that it was old and som-del streit,  
> This ilke Monk leet olde thinges pace,  
> And helde after the newe world the space.  
> He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,  
> That seith that hunters been nat holy men;  
> Ne that a Monk, whan he is cloisterlees,  
> Is likned til a fish that is waterlees;  
> This is to seyn, a Monk out of his cloistre.  
> But thilke text helde he nat worth an oistre;  
> And I seide his opinioun was good.  
> What sholde he studie, and make himselven wood,  
> Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,  
> Or swinken with his handes and laboure,  
> As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?  
> Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.  
> Therfore he was a pricasour aright;  
> Grehoundes he hadde as swift as fowel in flight;  
> Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare  
> Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.  
> I seigh his sleeves purfiled at the hond  
> With gris, and that the fyneste of the lond;  
> And for to festne his hood under his chin,  
> He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin;  
> A love-knot in the gretter ende ther was.  
> His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,  
> And eek his face, as he hadde been anoynt.  
> He was a lord ful fat and in good point;  
> His eyen stepe and rollende in his heed,  
> That stemed as a forneys of a leed;  
> His botes souple, his hors in greet estat.  
> Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;  
> He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost.  
> A fat swan loved he best of any roost;  
> His palfrey was as broun as is a berie.

> There was also a nun, a prioress,  
> Who, in her smiling, modest was and coy;  
> Her greatest oath was but "By Saint Eloy!"  
> And she was called Madam Eglentyne.  
> Full well she sang the service divine,  
> Intoning in her nose right seemly;  
> And French she spoke full well and gracefully,  
> After the school of Stratford atte Bowe;  
> For French of Paris was to her unknown.  
> At meat she was well taught with every grace;  
> She let no morsel fall from off her face,  
> Nor dipped her fingers in her sauce deep.  
> Well could she carry a morsel, and well keep  
> That no drop fell upon her breast indeed.  
> In courtesy was set full much her heed.  
> Her upper lip she wiped so clean and neat,  
> That in her cup was no smudge of fat or greese  
> When she had drunken of her draughts at feast.  
> Fittingly after meat she raught for bread.  
> And surely she was of a noble port;  
> Full pleasant, amiable in her comport.  
> And strove she to counterfeit the air  
> Of court, and be estatly in her fare,  
> And to be holden worthy of reverence.  
> But to speak of her conscience and penance:  
> She was so charitable and so pityous,  
> She would weep if she saw a mouse,  
> Caught in a trap, whether it were dead or bled.  
> Of small hounds had she that she fed and kept  
> With roasted flesh, or milk and fine white bread.  
> But sore would she weep if one of them were dead,  
> Or if men smote it with a rod to smart:  
> For all was conscience and a tender heart.  
> Full seemly was her wimple fashioned neat;  
> Her nose was fine; her eyes were grey and bright;  
> Her mouth was small, and therewith soft and red;  
> But certainly she had a fair forehead;  
> It was almost a span broad, I trow;  
> For, frankly, she was none of them so low.  
> Neat was her cloak, as I was well aware.  
> Of small coral about her arm she bare  
> A pair of beads, all garnished about with green;  
> And thereupon hung a brooch of gold full sheen;  
> On which was first written a crowned A,  
> And after, Amor vincit omnia.

### THE FRIAR

> A Frere ther was, a wanton and a merye,  
> A limitour, a ful solempne man.  
> In alle the ordres foure is noon that can  
> So muche of daliaunce and of fair langage.  
> He hadde maad ful many a mariage  
> Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.  
> Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.  
> Ful wel biloved and famulier was he  
> With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,  
> And eek with worthy wommen of the toun.  
> For he hadde power of confessioun,  
> As seide him-self more than a curat,  
> For of his ordre he was licentiat.  
> Ful swetely herde he confessioun,  
> And plesaunt was his absolucioun.  
> He was an esy man to yeve penaunce  
> Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce.  
> For unto a povre ordre for to yive  
> Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.  
> For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,  
> He wiste that a man was repentaunt.  
> For many a man so hard is of his herte,  
> He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.  
> Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,  
> Men moot yive silver to the povre freres.  
> His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves  
> And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.  
> And certeinly he hadde a mery note;  
> Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.  
> Of yeddinges he bar utterly the pris.  
> His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;  
> Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.  
> He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,  
> And everich hostiler and tappestere  
> Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;  
> For un-to swich a worthy man as he  
> Acorded nat, as by his facultee,  
> To han with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.  
> It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce  
> For to delen with no swich poraille,  
> But al with riche and sellers of vitaile.  
> And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,  
> Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.  
> Ther nas no man nowher so virtuous.  
> He was the beste beggere in his hous.  
> His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.  
> No of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;  
> For though a widwe hadde noght a sho,  
> So plesaunt was his In principio,  
> Yet wolde he have a ferthing er he wente.  
> His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.  
> And wayte he coude, as it were right a whelpe.  
> In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.  
> For there was he nat lyk a cloisterer,  
> With a thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,  
> But he was lyk a maister or a pope.  
> Of double worsted was his semi-cope,  
> That rounded as a belle out of the presse.  
> Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantonnesse,  
> To make his English swete upon his tonge;  
> And in his harping whan that he hadde songe,  
> His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,  
> As doon the sterres in the frosty night.  
> This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd.

> A friar there was, a wanton and a merry,  
> A limiter, a very ceremonious man.  
> In all the Orders Four there is none can  
> Match him in dalliance and in fair speech.  
> He had arranged full many a marriage  
> Of young women, at his own expense;  
> Unto his Order he was a noble post.  
> Full well beloved and familiar was he  
> With franklins over all in his country,  
> and also with worthy women of the town.  
> For he had power of confession, as he said,  
> More than a curate, for of his Order he was licentiate.  
> Full sweetly he heard confession, and pleasant was his absolution.  
> He was an easy man to give penance  
> Where he knew he would gain a good pittance.  
> For to a poor Order to give is sign that a man is well shriven.  
> For if he gave, he dared make boast, he knew the man repented.  
> For many a man so hard is of his heart, he cannot weep though he smart.  
> Therefore, instead of weeping and of prayers,  
> Men must give silver to the poor friars.  
> His tippet was aye stuffed full of knives  
> And pins, to give to fair wives.  
> And certainly he had a merry note;  
> Well could he sing and play upon a rote.  
> Of weddings he bore utterly the prize.  
> His neck was white as the lily of the field;  
> Thereunto he was strong as any champion.  
> He knew the taverns well in every town,  
> And every hostler and barmaid better  
> Than any leper or any beggar;  
> For unto such a worthy man as he  
> It did not accord, by his faculty,  
> To have acquaintance with sick lepers.  
> It is not honest, nor may it advance,  
> To deal with such poor rabble,  
> But all with rich and sellers of victuals.  
> And everywhere, where profit should arise,  
> Courteous he was, and humble for his guise.  
> There was no man nowhere so virtuous.  
> He was the best beggar in his house.  
> His earnings were far better than his rent.  
> None of his brethren came into his haunt;  
> For though a widow had not shoes to her feet,  
> So pleasant was his "In principio,"  
> Yet would he have a farthing ere he went.  
> His purchasing was better than his rent.  
> And romp he could, as if he were a whelp.  
> In love-days he could be of much help.  
> For there he was not like a cloisterer,  
> With a threadbare cope, like a poor scholar,  
> But he was like a master or a pope.  
> Of double worsted was his semi-cope,  
> That rounded as a bell out of the press.  
> Somewhat he lisped, from wantonness of phrasing,  
> To make his English sweet upon his tongue;  
> And in his harping after he had sung,  
> His eyes twinkled in his head right bright,  
> As do the stars in the frosty night.  
> This worthy limiter was called Hubert.

### THE MERCHANT

> A Marchant was ther with a forked berd,  
> In mottelee, and hye on hors he sat,  
> Upon his heed a Flaundrish bever hat;  
> His botes clasped faire and fetisly.  
> His resons he spak ful solempnely,  
> Souninge alway th' encrees of his winning.

> There was a merchant there with forked beard,  
> In motley clad, and high upon his horse he sat,  
> Upon his head a Flemish beaver hat;  
> His boots were fastened fair and neatly so.  
> His reasons he spoke full solemnly,  
> Ever stressing the increase of his winning.

---

### THE CLERK

> A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,  
> That unto logik hadde longe y-go.  
> As lene was his hors as is a rake,  
> And he was not right fat, I undertake;  
> But loche he was and therto soberly.

## THE PROLOGUE

He wolde the sea were kept for any thing  
Bitwix Middelburgh and Orewelle.  

Wele coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.  
This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette;  
Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette.  

So estatly was he of his governaunce,  
With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce.  
For sothe he was a worthy man with-all,  
But sooth to seyn, I noot how men him calle.  


### CLERK

A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,  
That unto logik hadde longe y-go.  
As lene was his hors as is a rake,  
And he nas nat right fat, I undertake;  
But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly.  
Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;  
For he had geten him yet no benefye,  
Ne was so wordly for to have offye.  

For him was lever have at his beddes heed  
Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,  
Of Aristotle and of his philosophye,  
Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye.  
But al be that he was a philosophre,  
Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;  
But al that he mighte of his freendes hente.  

On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,  
And bisily gan for the soules preye  
Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye.  
Of studie took he most cure and most hede.  
Noght o word spak he more than was nede.  
And that was seyd in forme and reverence,  
And short and quik, and ful of high sentence.  
Souninge in moral vertu was his speche.  

And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.  


### A SERGEANT OF THE LAW

A sergeant of the law, wary and wise,  
There was also, compact of excellence.  
Discreet he was, and of great reverence;  
At least he seemed so, his words were so wise.  
Often he sat as justice in assize,  
By patent or commission from the crown;  
Because of learning and of his high renown,  
He took large fees and many robes could own.  
So great a purchaser was never known.  

All was fee simple unto him, in effect,  
Wherefore his claims could never be suspect.  
Nowhere a man so busy of his class,  
And yet he seemed much busier than he was.  

All cases and all judgments could he cite  
That from King William’s time were apposite.  
And he could draw a contract so explicit  
That not any man could fault therefrom elicit;  
And every statute he’d verbatim quote.  

He rode but homely in a medley cote,  
Girt with a ceint of silk, with bars smale;  
Of his array telle I no lenger tale.  


### THE FRANKLIN

A Frankeleyn was in his companye;  
White was his beard, as is the dayesye.  
Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.  
He loved right well his morwe sop in wyn.  
To liven in delyt was ever his wonne,  
For he was Epicurus owne sonne,  
That heeld opinion that pleyn delyt  
Was verraily felicitee parfyt.  

An housholder, and that a greet, was he;  
Saint Julian he was in his contree.  
His breed, his ale, was alwey after oon;  
A better envyned man was no-wher noon.  
Withouten bake mete was never his hous.  
Of fish and flesh, and that so plentevous,  
It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke  
Of alle deyntees that men coude thinke.  

After the sondry sesons of the yeer  
So chaunged he his mete and his soper.  
Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe,  
And many a breem and many a luce in stewe.  
Wo was his cook, but-if his sauce were  
Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his gere.  

His table dormant in his halle alway  
Stood redy covered al the longe day.  
At sessions ther was he lord and sire;  
Ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire.  

An anlas and a gipser al of silk  
Heng at his girdel, white as morne milk.  
A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour;  
Was nowhere such a worthy vavasour.  


### THE HABERDASHER, THE CARPENTER, THE WEAVER, THE DYER, AND THE ARRAS-MAKER

An Haberdassher and a Carpenter,  
An Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapicer,  
Were with us eek, clothed in o liveree  
Of a solempne and greet fraternitee.  
Ful fresh and newe hir gere apiked was;  
Hir knyves were y-chaped noght with bras,  
But al with silver, wroght ful cleene and weel,  
Hir girdles and hir pouches every-deel.  

Ech of hem semed a fair burgeys  
To sitten in a yeldhalle on a deys.  
Everich, for the wisdom that he can,  
Was shaply for to been an alderman.  
For catel hadde they ynogh and rente,  
And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente;  
And elles certein were they to blame.  

It is ful fair to been y-clept "madame,"  
And goon to vigilyes al bifore,  
And have a mantel royalliche y-bore.  


### THE COOK

A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones,  
To boille the chiknes with the marybones,  
And poudre-marchant tart, and galingale.  
Wel coude he knowe a draughte of London ale.  
He coude roste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,  
Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.  

But very ille it was, it seemed to me,  
That on his shin a mormal hadde he;  
For blancmanger, that made he with the beste.  


### THE SHIPMAN

A Shipman was ther, woning fer by weste;  
For aught I woot, he was of Dartmouth.  
He rood upon a rouncy, as he couthe,  
In a gowne of falding to the knee.  
A daggere hanging on a laas hadde he  
About his nekke, under his arm adoun.  
The hot somer had maad his hew al broun;  
And certeinly, he was a good felawe.  

Ful many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-drawe  
From Burdeux-ward, whyl that the chapman sleep.  
Of nyce conscience took he no keep;  
If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond,  
By water he sente hem hoom to every lond.  

But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes,  
His stremes and his daungers him bisydes,  
His herberwe and his mone, his Iodemenage,  
Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.  
Hardy he was, and wys to undertake;  
With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake.  

He knew wel alle the havenes, as they were,  
From Gootlond to the cape of Finisterre,  
And every cryke in Britayne and in Spayne;  
His barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne.  


### THE DOCTOR

With us ther was a Doctour of Phisyk,  
In al this world ne was ther noon him lyk  
To speke of phisik and of surgerye;  
For he was grounded in astronomye.  
He kepte his pacient a ful greet del  
In houres, by his magik naturel.  
Wel coude he fortunen the ascendent  
Of his images for his pacient.  

He knew the cause of every maladye,  
Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste, or drye,  
And where engendred, and of what humour;  
He was a verrey parfit practisour.  
The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the rote,  
Anon he yaf the seke man his bote.  
Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries  
To sende him drogges and his letuaries;  
For ech of hem made other for to winne;  
Hir frendschipe nas nat newe to biginne.  

Wel knew he th'olde Esculapius,  
And Deiscorides, and eek Rufus,  
Old Ypocras, Haly, and Galien;  
Serapion, Razis, and Avicen;  
Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn;  
Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn.  

Of his diete nesurable was he,  
For it was of no superfluitee,  
But of greet norissing and digestible.  
His studie was but litel on the Bible.  
In sangwin and in pers he clad was al,  
Lyned with taffata and with sendal;  

And yet he was right chary of dispence;  
He kepte that he wan in pestilence.  
For gold in phisik is a cordial,  
Therfore he lovede gold in special.  


### THE WIFE OF BATH

A good Wyf was ther of bisyde Bathe,  
But she was somdel deef, and that was scathe.  
Of cloth-making she hadde swiche an haunt,  
She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.  
In al the parisshe wyf ne was ther noon  
That to th'offring bifore hire sholde goon;  
And if ther did, certeyn, so wrooth was she  
That she was out of alle charitee.  

Hir coverchiefs ful fine were of ground;  
I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound  
That on a Sonday were upon hire heed.  
Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed,  
Ful streite y-teyd, and shoos ful moiste and newe.  
Bold was hire face, and fair, and reed of hewe.  

She was a worthy womman al hire lyve;  
Husbondes at chirche-dore she hadde five,  
Withouten other companye in youth;  
But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouth.  
And thryes hadde she been at Jerusalem;  
She hadde passed many a straunge streem;  
At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,  
In Galice at seint Jame, and at Coloigne.  

She coude muche of wandring by the weye:  
Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.  
Upon an amblere esily she sat,  
Y-wimpled wel, and on hire heed an hat  
As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;  
A foot-mantel aboute hire hipes large.  
And on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe.  

In felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe.  
Of remedyes of love she knew perchaunce;  
For she coude of that art the olde daunce.  


### PARSON

There was a good man of religioun,  
And was a povre Persoun of a toun;  
But riche he was of holy thought and werk.  
He was also a lerned man, a clerk,  
That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;  
His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.  

Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,  
And in adversitee ful pacient;  
And swich he was y-preved ofte sythes.  
Ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes.  
But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,  
Unto his povre parisshens about  
Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce.  
He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.  

Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer a-sonder,  
But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder,  
In siknes nor in meschief, to visite  
The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte,  
Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf.  

This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,  
That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte;  
Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte:  
"If gold ruste, what shal iren do?"  
For if the preest be foul, on whom we truste,  
What wonder if a lewed man to ruste?  

And shame it is, if a preest take keep,  
A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.  
We ought a preest ensample for to yive,  
By his clennesse how that his sheep shold live.  
He sette nat his benefice to hyre,  
And leet his sheep encombred in the myre,  
And ran to London, unto Saint Poules,  
To seken him a chaunterie for soules,  
Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;  
But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,  
So that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie;  
He was a shepherde and no mercenarie.  

And though he holy were, and vertuous,  
He was to sinful man nat despitous,  
Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne,  
But in his teching discreet and benigne.  
To drawen folk to heven by fairnesse  
By good ensample was his bisynesse.  

But if it were any persone obstinat,  
What-so he were, of heigh or lowe estat,  
Him wolde he snibbe sharply for the nones.  
A better preest, I trowe, that nowher noon is.  
He wayted after no pompe and reverence,  
Ne maked him a spiced conscience,  
But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve,  
He taughte, and first he folwed it him-selve.  


### THE PLOWMAN

With him ther was a Plowman, was his brother,  
That hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother,  
A trewe swinker and a good was he,  
Livinge in pees and parfit charitee.  

God loved he best with al his hole herte  
At alle tymes, though him gamed or smerte,  
And thanne his neighebour right as him-selve.  
He wolde thresshe, and ther-to dyke and delve,  
For Cristes sake, for every povre wight,  
Withouten hyre, if it lay in his might.  

His tythes payed he ful faire and wel,  
Bothe of his propre swink and his catel.  
In a tabard he rood upon a mere.  

Ther was also a Reve and a Millere,  
A Somnour and a Pardoner also,  
A Maunciple, and myself; ther were namo.  


### THE MILLER

The Miller was a stout carl, for the nones,  
Ful big he was of braun, and eek of bones;  
That proved wel, for over-al ther he cam,  
At wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram.  
He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre,  
Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre,  
Or breke it, at a renning, with his heed.  

His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,  
And ther-to brood, as though it were a spade.  
Upon the cop right of his nose he hade  
A werte, and ther-on stood a tuft of heres,  
Red as the bristles in an old sow’s eares;  
His nostrils they were blake and very wide.  

A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde;  
His mouth was like a furnace-door for gree.  
He was a janglere and a goliardeys,  
And that was most of sinne and harlotryes.  
Wele coude he stele corn, and tollen thryes;  
And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.  

A white cote and a blue hood we red he;  
A baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne,  
And ther-with-al he broghte us out of towne.  


### THE MANCIPLE

A gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple,  
Of which achatours mighte take exemple  
For to be wise in bying of vitaille;  
For whether that he payde, or took by taille,  
Algate he wayted so in his achat,  
That he was ay biforn and in good stat.  

Now is it nat that of God a ful fair grace,  
That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace  
The wisdom of a heep of lerned men?  

Of maistres hadde he mo than thryes ten,  
That were of lawe expert and curious;  
Of which ther were a doseyn in that hous  
Worthy to been stiwardes of rente and lond  
Of any lord that is in Engelond,  
To make him live by his propre good,  
In honour dettelees, but he were wood,  
Or live as scarsly as him list desire;  
And able for to helpen al a shire  
In any cas that mighte falle or happe;  
And yet this maunciple sette hir aller cappe.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

These men were able to have helped a shire  
In any case that ever might befall;  

And yet this manciple outguessed them all.

## THE REEVE

> The Reeve was a slendre colerik man,  
> His berd was shave as ny as ever he can.

> In youthe he lerned hadde a good mister;

> This reve sat up-on a ful good stot,

> A long surcote of pers up-on he hade,

> And for to drinken strong wyn, reed as blood.  
> Than wolde he speke, and crye as he were wood.  
> And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,  
> Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn.

## THE KNIGHT’S TALE

*Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera Getis  
Prelia, laurigero, &c.* — *Statius, Theb. xii. 519*

> Once on a time, as old tales tell to us,  
> There was a duke whose name was Theseus;  
> Of Athens he was lord and governor,  
> And in his time was such a conqueror  
> That greater was there not beneath the sun.  
> Full many a rich country had he won;  
> What with his wisdom and his chivalry  
> He gained the realm of Femenye,  
> That was of old time known as Scythia.  
> There wedded he the queen, Hippolyta,  
> And brought her home with him to his country,  
> In glory great and with great pageantry,  
> And, too, her younger sister, Emily.  
> And thus, in victory and with melody,  
> Let I this noble duke to Athens ride  
> With all his armed host marching at his side.  
> And truly, were it not too long to hear,  
> I would have told you fully how, that year,  
> Was gained the realm of Femenye  
> By Theseus, and by his chivalry;  
> And all of the great battle that was wrought  
> Where Amazons and the Athenians fought;  
> And how was wooed and won Hippolyta,  
> That fair and hardy queen of Scythia;  
> And of the feast was made at their wedding,  
> And of the tempest at their home-coming;  
> But all of that I must for now forbear.  
> I have, God knows, a large field for my share.  
> And weak the oxen, and the soil is tough.  
> The remnant of the tale is long enough.  
> I will not hinder any, in my turn;  
> Let each man tell his tale, until we learn  
> Which of us all the most deserves to win;  
> So where I stopped, again I’ll now begin.
> 
> This duke, of whom I make mencion,  
> When he was come almost unto the town,  
> In al his wele and in his moste pryde,  
> He was war, as he caste his eye aside,  
> That right upon the road, as suppliants do,  
> A company of ladies, two by two,  
> Knelt, all in black, before his cavalcade;  
> But such a clamorous cry of woe they made  
> That in the whole world living man had heard  
> No such a lamentation, on my word;  
> Nor would they cease lamenting till at last  
> They’d clutched his bridle reins and held them fast.

“What folk are you that at my home-coming  
Disturb my triumph with this dolorous thing?” cried Theseus.  
“Do you so much envy my honour that you thus complain and cry?  
Or who has wronged you now, or who offended?  
Come, tell me whether it may be amended;  
And tell me, why are you clothed thus, in black?”

The eldest lady of them answered back, after she’d swooned, with cheek so deathly drear  
That it was pitiful to see and hear, and said: “Lord, to whom Fortune has but given  
Victory, and to conquer where you’ve striven, your glory and your honour grieve not us;  
But we beseech your aid and pity thus. Have mercy on our woe and our distress.  
Some drop of pity, of your gentleness, upon us wretched women, oh, let fall!

“For see, lord, there is no one of us all that has not been a duchess or a queen;  
Now we are captives, as may well be seen: thanks be to Fortune and her treacherous wheel,  
There’s none can rest assured of constant weal. And truly, lord, expecting your return,  
Here in the temple of the goddess Clemence we have been waiting through a long fortnight;  
Now help us, lord, since it is in your might.

“I, wretched woman, who am weeping thus, was once the wife of King Capaneus,  
Who died at Thebes, oh, cursed be the day! And all we that you see in this array,  
And make this lamentation to be known, all we have lost our husbands at that town  
During the siege that round about it lay. And now the old Creon, ah, welaway!  
The lord and governor of Thebes city, full of his wrath and all iniquity,  
He, in despite and out of tyranny, to do the dead a shame and villainy,  
Of all our husbands, lying among the slain, has piled the bodies in a heap, amain,  
And will not suffer them, nor give consent, to buried be, or burned, nor will relent,  
But sets his dogs to eat them, out of spite.”

And on that word, at once, without respite, they all fell prone and cried out piteously:  
“Have on us wretched women some mercy, and let our sorrows sink into your heart!”

This gentle duke, down from his horse, did start with heart of pity, when he’d heard them speak.  
It seemed to him his heart must surely break, seeing them there so miserable of state,  
Who had been proud and happy but so late. And in his arms he took them tenderly, giving them comfort and understanding;  
And swore his oath, that as he was true knight, he would put forth so thoroughly his might  
Against the tyrant Creon as to wreak vengeance so great that all of Greece should speak  
And say how Creon was by Theseus served, as one that had his death full well deserved.

This sworn and done, he no more there abode; his banner he displaced, and forth he rode.

And there he liveth, in joye and in honour, in term of his life; what nedeth wordes mo?  
And in a tour, in anguish and in wo, dwellen this Palamon and eke Arcite,  
For evermore; ther may no gold hem quyte. This passeth yeer by yeer, and day by day,  
Til it befell ones, in a morwe of May, that Emelye, that fairer was to sene  
Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene, and fresher than the May with floures newe—  
For with the rose colour stroof hir hewe, I noot which was the fairer of hem two—  
Er it were day, as was hir wone to do, she was arisen, and al redy dight;  
For May wol have no sloggardye a-night. The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,  
And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte, and seith, “Arys, and do thyn observaunce.”  
This maked Emelye have remembraunce to doon honour to May, and for to ryse.  
Y-clothed was she fresh, for to devyse; hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse  
Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse. And in the gardin, at the sonne up-riste,  
She walketh up and doun, and as hir liste she gadereth floures, party whyte and rede,  
To make a sotil gerland for hir hede. And as an aungel hevenly she song.

The grete tour, that was so thikke and strong, which of the castel was the chief dongeoun  
(Ther-as the knightes weren in prisoun of whiche I tolde yow, and tellen shal)  
Was evene joynant to the gardin-wal, ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyinge.  
Bright was the sonne, and cleer that morweninge. And Palamon, this woful prisoner,  
As was his wone, by leve of his gayler, was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh  
In which he al the noble citee seigh, and eek the gardin ful of braunches grene,  
Ther-as this fresshe Emelye the shene was in hir walk, and romed up and doun.

This sorweful prisoner, this Palamon, goth in the chambre, roming to and fro,  
And to himself compleyning of his wo; that he was born, fulofte he seyde, “Alas!”  
And so bifel, by aventure or cas, that thurgh a window, thikke of many a barre  
Of yren greet, and square as any spar, he caste his eye upon Emelya,  
And ther-with-al he bleynte, and cryde “A!” as though he stongen were unto the herte.  
And with that cry Arcite anon up-sterte, and seyde, “Cosin myn, what eyleth thee,  
That art so pale and deedly on to see? Why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence?  
For Goddes love, tak al in pacience our prisoun, for it may non other be;  
Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.

> Som wikke aspect or disposicioun  
> Of Saturne, by sum constellacioun,  
> Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;  
> So stood the heven whan that we were born;  
> We moste endure it: this is the short and pleyn.”

This Palamon answerde, and seyde ageyn, “Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun  
Thou hast a veyn imaginacioun. This prison caused me nat for to crye.  
But I was hurt right now through-out myn oghneye into myn herte, that wol my bane be.  
The fairnesse of that lady that I see yond in the gardin romen to and fro  
Is cause of al my crying and my wo. I noot wher she be womman or goddesse;  
But Venus is it, soothly, as I gesse.”

And ther-with-al on knees doun he fil, and seyde: “Venus, if it be thy wil  
Yow in this gardin thus to transfigure bifore me, sorweful wrecche creature,  
Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen. And if so be my destinee be shapen  
By eterne word to dyen in prisoun, of our linage have som compassioun,  
That is so lowe y-broght by tirannye.”

And with that word Arcite gan espye wheras this lady romed to and fro.  
And with that sighte hir beautee hurte him so, that, if that Palamon was wounded sore,  
Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or more. And with a sigh he seyde pitously:  
“The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly of hir that rometh in the yonder place;  
And, but I have hir mercy and hir grace, that I may seen hir atte leeste weye,  
I nam but deed; ther nis namore to seye.”

This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde, dispitously he loked, and answerde:  
“Whether seistow this in ernest or in pley?” — “Nay,” quod Arcite, “in ernest, by my fey!  
God help me so, me list ful yvele pleye.” This Palamon gan knitte his browes tweye:  
“It nere,” quod he, “to thee no greet honour for to be fals, ne for to be traytour  
To me, that am thy cosin and thy brother y-sworn ful depe, and ech of us til other,  
That never, for to dyen in the peyne, til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne,  
Neither of us in love to hindren other, ne in non other cas, my leve brother;  
But that thou sholdest trewely forthren me in every cas, and I shal forthren thee.  
This was thyn ooth, and myn also, certeyn; I wot right wel thou darst it nat withseyn.  
Thus artow of my counseil, out of doute. And now thou woldest falsly been aboute  
To love my lady, whom I love and serve, and ever shal, til that myn herte sterve.  
Now certes, fals Arcite, thou shah nat so. I loved hir first, and tolde thee my wo  
As to my counseil, and my brother sworn to forthre me, as I have told biforn.”

This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn, “Thou shalt,” quod he, “be rather fals than I;  
But thou art fals, I telle thee utterly; for par amour I loved hir first er thow.  
What wiltow seyn? thou wistest nat yet now whether she be a womman or goddesse!  
Thyn is affeccioun of holinesse, and myn is love, as to a creature;  
For which I tolde thee myn aventure as to my cosin, and my brother sworn.  
I pose that thou lovedest hir biforn; wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,  
That ‘who shal yeve a lover any lawe?’ Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,  
Than may be yeve to any erthly man. And therefore positif lawe and swich decree  
Is broke al-day for love, in ech degree. A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed.  
He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed, al be she mayde, or widwe, or elles wyf.  
And eek it is nat lykly, al thy lyf, to stonden in hir grace; namore shal I;  
For wel thou woost thy-selven, verraily, that thou and I be dampned to prisoun  
Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun. We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;  
They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon; ther cam a kyte, whyl that they were wrothe,  
And bar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe. And therfore, at the kinges court, my brother,  
Ech man for him-self, ther is non other. Love if thee list; for I love and ay shal;  
And soothly, leve brother, this is al. Here in this prisoun mote we endure,  
And everich of us take his aventure.”

Great was the stryf and long bitwixe hem tweye. If that I hadde leyser for to seye,  
But to the effect: it happed on a day (to telle it yow as shortly as I may)  
A worthy duk that highte Pirithous, that felawe was unto duk Theseus  
Sin thilke day that they were children lyte, was come to Athenes, his felawe to visite.  
And for to pleye, as he was wont to do — for in this world he loved no man so,  
And he loved him as tendrely ageyn. So wel they loved, as olde bokes seyn,  
That whan that oon was deed, sothly to telle, his felawe wente and soghte him doun in helle;  
But of that story list me nat to wryte.
>
> Duk Pirithous loved wel Arcite,  
> And hadde him knowe at Thebes yeer by yere;  
> And fynally, at requeste and preyere  
> Of Pirithous, with-oute any raunsoun,  
> Duk Theseus him leet out of prisoun,  
> Freely to goon, wher that him liste over-al,  
> In swich a gyse, as I you tellen shal.
>
> This was the forward, pleynly for t’endyte,  
> Bitwixen Theseus and him Arcite:

That if Arcite, any time, were found ever in life, by day or night, on ground  
Of any country of this Theseus, and he were caught, it was concerted thus,  
That by the sword he straight should lose his head. He had no choice; so taking leave he sped homeward to Thebes, lest by the sword’s sharp edge he forfeit life. His neck was under pledge.

How great a sorrow is Arcite’s now! How through his heart he feels death’s heavy blow;  
He weeps, he wails, he cries out piteously; he thinks to slay himself all privily.  
Said he: “Alas, the day that I was born! I’m in worse prison now, and more forlorn;”

## THE KNIGHT’S TALE

### First Part — Modern English

> Now am I doomed eternally to dwell  
> No more in Purgatory, but in Hell.  
>  
> Alas, that I have known Pirithous!  
>  
> For else had I remained with Theseus,  
> Fettered within that cell; but even so  
> Then had I been in bliss and not in woe.  
>  
> Only the sight of her that I would serve,  
> Though I might never her dear grace deserve,  
> Would have sufficed, oh well enough for me!  
>  
> O my dear cousin Palamon, said he,  
> Yours is the victory, and that is sure,  
> For there, full happily, you may endure.  
>  
> In prison? Never, but in Paradise!  
> Oh, well has Fortune turned for you the dice,  
> Who have the sight of her, I the absence.  
>  
> For possible it is, in her presence,  
> You being a knight, a worthy and able,  
> That by some chance, since Fortune’s changeable,  
> You may to your desire sometime attain.  
>  
> But I, that am in exile and in pain,  
> Stripped of all hope and in so deep despair  
> That there’s no earth nor water, fire nor air,  
> Nor any creature made of them there is  
> To help or give me comfort, now, in this —  
>  
> Surely I’ll die of sorrow and distress;  
> Farewell, my life, my love, my joyousness!  
>  
> Alas! Why is it men so much complain  
> Of what great God, or Fortune, may ordain,  
> When better is the gift, in any guise,  
> Than men may often for themselves devise?  
>  
> One man desires only that great wealth  
> Which may but cause his death or long ill-health.

> We fare as he that’s drunken as a mouse;

>  
> And so Arcita, in the court royal

> Is risen, and looks on the merry day.  
>  
> And now, to do his reverence to May,  
> Calling to mind the point of his desire,  
> He on a courser, leaping high like fire,  
> Is ridden to the fields to muse and play,  
> Out of the court, a mile or two away;  
> And to the grove, whereof I lately told,  
> By accident his way began to hold.  
>  
> To make him there the garland that one weaves  
> Of woodbine leaves and of green hawthorn leaves.  
> And loud he sang within the sunlit sheen:  
>  
> “O May, with all thy flowers and all thy green,  
> Welcome be thou, thou fair and freshening May:  
> I hope that I some greene gete may.”

# THE KNIGHT’S TALE

## Modern English

> And with that word he fell down in a trance  
> A long time; and after he up-started.  
> "I hope to pluck some garland green today."  
>  
> And from his courser, with a lusty heart,  
> Into the grove right hastily did start.  
>  
> And on a path he wandered up and down,  
> Near which, and as it chanced, this Palamon  
> Lay in the thicket, where no man might see,  
> For sore afraid of finding death was he.  
>  
> He knew not that Arcita was so near:  
> God knows he would have doubted eye and ear,  
> But it has been a truth these many years  
> That "Fields have eyes and every wood has ears."  
> It's well for one to bear himself with poise;  
>  
> For every day unlooked-for chance annoys.  
>  
> And little knew Arcita of his friend,  
> Who was so near and heard him to the end,  
> Where in the bush he sat now, keeping still.  
>  
> Arcita, having roamed and roved his fill,  
> And having sung his rondel, lustily,  
> Into a study fell he, suddenly,  
> As do these lovers in their strange desires,  
> Now in the trees, now down among the briers,  
> Now up, now down, like bucket in a well.  
>  
> Even as on a Friday, truth to tell,  
> The sun shines now, and now the rain comes fast,  
> Even so can fickle Venus overcast  
> The spirits of her people; as her day  
> Is changeful, so she changes her array.  
>  
> Seldom is Friday quite like all the week.  
>  
> Arcita, having sung, began to speak,  
> And sat him down, sighing like one forlorn.  
> "Alas," said he, "the day that I was born!  
>  
> How long, O Juno, of thy cruelty,  
> Wilt thou wage bitter war on Thebes city?  
>  
> Alas! Confounded beyond all reason  
> The blood of Cadmus and of Amphion;  
>  
> Of royal Cadmus, who was the first man  
> To build at Thebes, and first the town began,  
>  
> And first of all the city to be king;  
>  
> Of his lineage am I, and his offspring,  
> By true descent, and of the stock royal:  
>  
> And now I'm such a wretched serving thrall,  
> That he who is my mortal enemy,  
> I serve him as his squire, and all humbly.  
>  
> And even more does Juno give me shame,  
> For I dare not acknowledge my own name;  
>  
> But whereas I was Arcita by right,  
> Now I'm Philostrates, not worth a mite.  
>  
> Alas, thou cruel Mars! Alas, Juno!  
> Thus have your angers all our kin brought low,  
> Save only me, and wretched Palamon,  
>  
> Whom Theseus martyrs yonder in prison.  
>  
> And above all, to slay me utterly,  
> Love has his fiery dart so burningly  
> Struck through my faithful and care-laden heart,  
> My death was patterned ere my swaddling-shirt.  
>  
> You slay me with your two eyes, Emily;  
> You are the cause for which I now must die.  
>  
> For on the whole of all my other care  
> I would not set the value of a tare,  
>  
> So I could do one thing to your pleasance!"  
>  
> And with that word he fell down in a trance  
> That lasted long; and then he did up-start.

> This Palamon, who thought that through his heart  
> He felt a cold and sudden sword blade glide.  
>  
> For rage he shook, no longer would he hide.  
>  
> But after he had heard Arcita's tale,  
> As he were mad, with face gone deathly pale,  
> He started up and sprang out of the thicket,  
> Crying: "Arcita, oh you traitor wicked.  
>  
> Now are you caught, that crave my lady so,  
> For whom I suffer all this pain and woe,  
>  
> And are my blood, and know my secrets' store,

> You shall not love my lady Emily,

>  
> This Arcita, with scornful, angry heart,

> Fierce as a lion, out he pulled a sword,  
>  
> And answered thus: "By God that sits above!  
> Were it not you are sick and mad for love,

> And that you have no weapon in this place,

> But meet your death right now, and at my hand.

> What, arrant fool, love's free to choose and do,

> To come here armed and harnessed as a knight,

> This Palamon replied: "I do agree."

>  
> So on his horse, alone as he was born,  
> He carried out that harness as he'd sworn;

> And in the grove, at time and place y-set,

> Then changed the colour in their face;  
> Right as the hunter in the realm of Thrace,

> That stands at the gap with a spear,

> And hears him come rushing in the groves,

> And thinketh, "Here cometh my mortal enemy,

>  
> For either I must slay him at the gap,  
> Or he must slay me, if that me mishap:"  
>  
> So fared they, in changing of their hue,  
> As far as ever each of them other knew.  
>  
> There was no good day, nor any saluting;  
> But straight, without word or rehersing,  
> Each of them helped for to arm the other,  
>  
> As friendly as he were his own brother;  
>  
> And after that, with sharp spears strong  
> They foiled each at other wondrous long.  
>  
> Thou mightest ween that this Palamon  
> In his fighting were a wood lion,  
>  
> And as a cruel tiger was Arcite:  
>  
> As wild boars, they began to smite,  
> That froth white as foam for ire wood.

> Up to the ankle fought they in their blood.

>  
> For certainly our appetites here,

>  
> This mean I now by mighty Theseus,

>  
> And namely at the great hart in May,  
> That in his bed there dawneth him no day  
> That he is not clad, and ready for to ride  
> With hunt and horn, and houndes him beside.  
>  
> For in his hunting hath he such delight,  
> That it is all his joy and appetite  
> To be himself the great hart's bane:  
>  
> For after Mars he serveth now Diane.  
>  
> Clear was the day, as I have told ere this,

> With his Hippolyta, the fair queen,  
>  
> And Emily, clothed all in green,  
> On hunting be they ridden royally.  
>  
> And to the grove, that stood full fast by,

> And when this duke was come upon that land,  
> Under the slanting sun he looked anon,  
> And there saw Arcita and Palamon,  
> Who furiously fought, as two boars do;  
>  
> The bright swords went in circles to and fro  
> So terribly, that even their least stroke  
> Seemed powerful enough to fell an oak;  
>  
> But who the two were, nothing did he note.  
>  
> This duke his courser with the sharp spurs smote,

> And lugged his great sword out, and cried out, "Ho!  
> No more, I say, on pain of losing head!  
>  
> By mighty Mars, that one shall soon be dead

>  
> As if you rode in lists right royally?"  
>  
> This Palamon replied, then, hastily,  
> Saying: "O Sire, what need for more ado?  
>  
> We have deserved our death at hands of you.  
>  
> Two woeful wretches are we, two captives  
> That are encumbered by our own sad lives;  
>  
> And as you are a righteous lord and judge,  
> Give us not either mercy or refuge.  
>  
> But slay me first, for sacred charity;  
> But slay my fellow here, as well, with me.  
>  
> Or slay him first; for though you learn it late,  
> This is your mortal foe, Arcita — wait! —  
> That from the land was banished, on his head,  
>  
> And for which he merits to be dead.  
>  
> For this is he who came unto your gate,  
> Calling himself Philostrates — nay, wait! —  
> Thus has he fooled you well this many a year.  
>  
> And you have made him your chief squire, I hear:  
> And this is he that loves fair Emily.  
>  
> For since the day is come when I must die,  
> I make confession plainly and say on,  
>  
> That I am that same woeful Palamon  
> Who has your prison broken viciously.  
>  
> I am your mortal foe, and it is I  
> Who love so hotly Emily the bright  
> That I'll die gladly here within her sight.  
>  
> Therefore do I ask death as penalty;  
> But slay my fellow with the same mercy,  
> For both of us deserve but to be slain."  
>  
> This worthy duke presently spoke again,  
> Saying: "This judgment needs but a short session:  
> Your own mouth, aye, and by your own confession,  
> Has doomed and damned you, as I shall record.  
> There is no need for torture, on my word.  
>  
> But you shall die, by mighty Mars the red!"  
>  
> But then the queen, whose heart for pity bled,  
> Began to weep, and so did Emily  
> And all the ladies in the company.  
>  
> Great pity must it be, so thought they all,  
> That ever such misfortune should befall:  
>  
> For these were gentlemen, of great estate,  
> And for no thing, save love, was their debate.  
>  
> They saw their bloody wounds, so sore and wide,  
> And all cried out—greater and less, they cried:  
> "Have mercy, lord, upon us women all!"

> And on their bare knees adown they fell,  
> And would have kissed his feet there as he stood,  
> Till at the last his mood was slackened;  
>  
> For pity runneth soon in gentle heart.  
>  
> And though he first for ire shook and started,  
> He hath considered shortly, in a clause,  
> The trespass of them both, and eke the cause:  
>  
> And although that his ire their guilt accused,  
> Yet in his reason he them both excused;  
>  
> As thus: he thought well, that every man  
> Will help himself in love, if that he can,  
>  
> And eke deliver himself out of prison;  
>  
> And eke his heart had compassion  
> Of women, for they weep ever in one;  
>  
> And in his gentle heart he thought anon.  
>  
> And softly unto himself he said: "Fie  
> Upon a lord that will have no mercy,  
>  
> But be a lion, both in word and deed,  
> To them that be in repentance and in dread  
> As well as to a proud despitous man

>  
> And shortly, when his ire was thus agone,

>  
> "The god of love, ah benedicite!  
> How mighty and how great a lord is he!  
>  
> Against his might there gaineth none obstacles.  
> He may be called a god for his miracles;

> For he can make at his own guise

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE KNIGHT’S TALE (Part 7)

    And thanked him there with all his heart and might,
    And specially those Thebans did their part.
    And thus, with high hopes, being blithe of heart,

    At request of the queen that kneleth here,
    And eke of Emelye, my suster dear,
    And ye shul bothe anon unto me swere,
    That never-mo ye shul my contree dere,
    Ne make werre upon me night ne day,
    But been my freendes in al that ye may;
    I yow foryeve this trespass everydel.”

    And they him swore his asking fair and wel,
    And him of lordship and of mercy preyde.
    And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde:

    “To speke of royal lineage and richesse,
    Though that she were a queen or a princesse,
    Ech of yow bothe is worthy, doutelees,
    To wedden whan tyme is, but nathelees
    I speke as for my suster Emelye,
    For whom ye have this stryf and jelousye;
    Ye woot your-self, she may not wedden two
    At ones, though ye tighten evermo:
    That oon of yow, al be him looth or leef,
    He moot go pypen in an ivy-leef;
    This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
    Al be ye never so jelous, ne so wrothe.
    And for-thy I yow putte in this degree,
    That ech of yow shal have his destinee
    As him is shape; and herkneth in what wyse;
    Lo, heer your ende of that I shal devyse.
    My wil is this, for plat conclusioun,
    With-outen any replicacioun,
    If that yow lyketh, tak it for the beste,
    That everich of yow shal gon wher him leste
    Frely, with-outen raunson or daunger;
    And this day fifty wykes, fer ne ner,
    Everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes,
    Armed for listes up at alle rightes,
    Al redy to darreyne hir by bataille.
    And this bihote I yow, with-outen faille,
    Upon my trouthe, and as I am a knight,
    That whether of yow bothe that hath might,
    This is to seyn, that whether he or thou
    May with his hundred, as I spak of now,
    Sleen his contrarie, or out of listes dryve,
    Him shal I yeve Emelye to wyve,
    To whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
    The listes shal I maken in this place,
    And God so wisly on my soule rewe,
    As I shal even juge been and trewe.
    Ye shul non other ende with me maken,
    That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
    And if yow thinketh this is wel y-sayd,
    Seyeth your avys, and holdeth yow apayd.
    This is your ende and your conclusioun.”

    Who loketh lightly now but Palamon?
    Who springeth up for joye but Arcite?
    Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte,
    The joye that is maked in the place
    Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
    But doun on knees wente every maner wight,
    And thanked him with al her herte and might,
    And namely the Thebans ofte sythe.
    And thus with good hope and with herte blythe
    They take hir leve, and hom-ward gonne they ryde
    To Thebes, with his olde walles wyde.

### HERE ENDETH THE SECOND PART

### HERE FOLLOWETH THE THIRD PART

    I trowe men wolde deme it negligence,
    If I foryete to tellen the dispence
    Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
    To maken up the listes royally;
    That swich a noble theatre as it was,
    I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.
    The circuit a myle was aboute,
    Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute.
    Round was the shap, in maner of compas,
    Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,
    That, whan a man was set on o degree,
    He letted nat his felawe for to see.
    Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt,
    West-ward, right swich another in the opposit.
    And shortly to concluden, swich a place
    Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;
    For in the lond ther nas no crafty man,
    That geometrie or ars-metrik can,
    Ne purtreyour, ne kerver of images,
    That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages
    The theatre for to maken and devyse.
    And for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse,
    He est-ward hath, upon the gate above,
    In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
    Don make an auter and an oratorie;
    And west-ward, in the minde and in memorie
    Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another.
    That coste largely of gold a fother.
    And north-ward, in a touret on the wal,
    Of alabastre whyt and reed coral
    An oratorie riche for to see,
    In worship of Dyane of chastitee,
    Hath Theseus don wrought in noble wyse.
    But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
    The noble kerving, and the portreitures,
    The shap, the countenaunce, and the figures
    That weren in thise oratories three.

    First in the temple of Venus maystow see
    Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
    The broken slepes, and the sykes colde;
    The sacred teres, and the waymenting;
    The fyry strokes of the desiring,
    That loves servaunts in this lyf enduren;
    The othes, that hir covenants assuren;
    Plesaunce and hope, desyr, fool-hardinesse,
    Beautee and youthe, bauderie, richesse,
    Charmes and force, lesinges, flaterye,
    Dispense, bisynesse, and jelousye,
    That wered of yelwe goldes a gerland,
    And a cokkow sitting on hir hand;
    Festes, instruments, caroles, daunces,
    Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
    Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal,
    By ordre weren peynted on the wal,
    And mo than I can make of mencioun.
    For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
    Ther Venus hath hir chief and favoured dwelling,
    Was peynted on that wal, beyond my idling,
    With alle the gardin and the lustiness,
    Nor was forgotten the gate-ward Idleness,
    Nor lair Narcissus of the years long gon,
    Nor yet the folie of King Solomon,
    No, nor the giant strength of Hercules,
    Nor Circe’s and Medea’s sorceries;
    Nor Turnus with his hardy, fierce courage,
    Nor the rich Croesus, captive in his age.
    Thus may be seen that wisdom, nor largess,
    Beauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness,
    May with Queen Venus share authority;
    For as she wills, so must the whole world be.
    Lo, all these folk were so caught in her snare,
    They cryed aloud in sorrow and in care.
    I lere let suffice examples one or two,
    Though I might give a thousand more to you.
    The form of Venus, glorious as could be,
    Was naked, floating on the open sea;
    And from the navel down all covered was
    With green waves, bright as ever any glass.
    A citole in her small right hand had she,
    And on her head, and beautiful to see,
    A garland of red roses, sweet smelling;
    Above her swirled her white doves, fluttering.
    Before her stood her one son, Cupido,
    Whose two white wings upon his shoulders grow;
    And blind he was, as it is often seen;
    A bow he bore, and arrows bright and keen.

    Why should I not as well, now, tell you all
    The portraiture that was upon the wall
    Within the fane of mighty Mars the red?
    In length and breadth the whole wall was painted
    Like the entrails of that grisly place
    That hight the great temple of Mars in Trace,
    In thilk cold frosty region,
    Ther-as Mars hath his sovereyn mansion.
    First on the wall was limned a vast forest
    Wherein there dwelt neither man nor beast,
    With knotted, gnarled, and leafless trees, so old,
    Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;
    Through which there ran a rumbling and a swough,
    As though a storm should bresten every bough.
    And downward from an hille, under a bente,
    Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,
    Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entrec
    Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.
    And ther-out cam a rage and such a vese,
    That it made al the gates for to rese.
    The northren light in at the dores shoon,
    For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
    Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
    The dores were alle of adamant eterne,
    Y-clenched overthwart and endelong
    With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
    Every piler, the temple to sustene,
    Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.
    Ther saugh I first the derke imagining
    Of felony, and al the compassing;
    The cruel ire, reed as any glede;
    The pykepurs, and eke the pale drede;
    The smyler with the knyf under the cloke;
    The ferne barns burning with the blacke smoke;
    The treson of the mordring in the bedde;
    The open werre, with woundes al bi-bledde;
    Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace;
    Al ful of chirking was that sory place.
    The slayer of himself yet saugh I ther;
    His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer;
    The nayl y-driven in the shode a-night;
    The colde deeth, with mouth gaping upright.
    Amidstes of the temple sat Meschaunce,
    With discomfort and sory countenaunce.
    Yet saugh I woodnesse laughing in his rage;
    Armed compleint, out-heres, and hers outrage.
    The careyne in the bush, with throte y-corve;
    A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm y-storve;
    The tiraunt, with the prey by force y-raft;
    The toun destroyed, ther was nothing laft.
    Yet saugh I brent the shippes hopesteres;
    The hunte strangled with the wilde beres;
    The sowe freten the child right in the cradel;
    The cook y-scalded, for al his longe ladel.
    Noght was foryeten by th’infortune of Marte;
    The carter over-riden with his carte,
    Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
    Ther were also, of Martes division,
    The barbour, and the bocher, and the smith
    That forgeth sharp swerdes on his stith.
    And al above, depainted in a tour,
    Saw I Conquest sitting in greet honour,
    With the sharpe swerde over his heed
    Hanging by a sotil twynes threed.
    Depainted was the slaughtre of Julius,
    Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;
    Al be that thilke time they were unborn,
    Yet was hir deeth depainted ther-bifore,
    By manasinge of Mars, right by figure;
    So was it shewed in that portreiture
    As is depainted in the sterres above,
    Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.
    Suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde,
    I may not rekne hem alle, though I wolde.
    The statue of Mars upon a carte stood,
    Armed, and loked grim as he were wood;
    And over his heed ther shynen two figures
    Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures;
    That oon Puella, that other Rubeus.
    This god of armes was arrayed thus:
    A wolf ther stood bifore him at his feet
    With eyen rede, and of a man he eet;
    With sotil pencel was depainted this storie,
    In redoutinge of Mars and of his glorie.

    Now to the temple of Diane the chaste,
    As shortly as I can I wol me haste,
    To telle yow al the descripcioun.
    Depainted been the walles up and doun
    Of hunting and of shamfast chastitee.
    Ther saugh I how Calisto pined sore,
    Whan that Diane agreved was with her;
    Was turned from a womman til a bere,
    And after was she maad the lode-sterre;
    There was it; I can nat tell how such thinges be.
    Her son, well may men seen, is eke a sterre.
    Ther saugh I Daphne turned into a tree
    (I mene not Diane, but she
    That was the daughter of Peneus, cleped Daphne).
    I saugh Actaeon made a hart all rude
    For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;
    I saugh how that his hounds have him caught,
    And freten him, for that they knewe him naught.
    Yet peynted was a little further-more
    How Atalanta hunted the wild boor,
    And Meleager, and many another mo,
    For which Diane wroghte him care and wo.
    Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
    The whiche me list nat drawen to memorie.
    This goddesse on an hert ful hye sat,
    With smale houndes al about her feet;
    And underneethe her feet she hadde a mone,
    Wexing it was, and sholde wane sone.
    In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,
    With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas.
    Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun,
    Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
    A womman travailing was hir bifore,
    But, for hir child so longe was unborn,
    Ful pitously Lucina gan she calle,
    And seyde, “Help, for thou mayst best of alle.”
    Wel couthe he peynten lyfely that it wroghte,
    With many a florin he the hewes boghte.

    Now been thise listes maad, and Theseus,
    That at his grete cost arrayed thus
    The temples and the theatre everydel,
    Whan it was doon, him lyked wonder wel.
    But stinte I wol of Theseus a lite,
    And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
    The day approcheth of hir retourninge,
    That everich sholde an hundred knightes bringe
    The bataille to darreyne, as I yow tolde;
    And til Athens, hir covenant for to holde,
    Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knightes
    Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.
    And sikerly, ther trowed many a man
    That never, sithen that the world bigan,
    As for to speke of knighthod of hir hond,
    As fer as God hath maked see or lond,
    Nas, of so fewe, so noble a companye.
    For every wight that loved chivalrye,
    And wolde, his thankes, han a passant name,
    Hath preyed that he mighte ben of that game;
    And wel was him, that ther-to chosen was.
    For if ther fille to-morwe swich a cas,
    Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knight,
    That loveth paramours, and hath his might,
    Were it in Engelond, or elles-where,
    They wolde, hir thankes, willen to be there
    To fighte for a lady; benite!
    It were a lusty sighte for to see.
    And right so ferden they with Palamon.
    With him ther wenten knightes many oon;
    Some wol ben armed in an habergeon,
    And in a brest-plat and in a light gipoun;
    And some wol have a peyre plates large;
    And somme woln have a Prusse sheld, or a targe;
    Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
    And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
    Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old;
    Armed were they, as I have you told,
    Everich after his opinioun.

    Ther maistow seen coming with Palamon
    Lycurgus himself, the grete king of Trace;
    Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.
    The cercles of his eyen in his heed
    They glaucen bitwixe yelow and reed.
    And lyk a griffon loked he aboute,
    With kempe heres on his browes stoute;
    His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge,
    His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe.
    And as the gyse was in his contree,
    Ful hye upon a char of gold stood he,
    With foure whyte boles in the trays.
    In-stede of cote-armure over his hamays,
    With nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold,
    He hadde a beres skin, col-blak, for-old.
    His longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak,
    As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:
    A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte,
    Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
    Of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts.
    Aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts,
    Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
    To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
    And folwed him, with mosel faste y-bounde,
    Colers of gold, and torets fyled rounde.
    An hundred lordes hadde he in his route
    Armed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute.

    With Arcita, in stories as men finde,
    The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde,
    Upon a stede bay, trapped in steel,
    Covered in cloth of gold diapred weel,
    Cam ryding lyk the god of armes, Mars.
    His cote-armure was of cloth of Tars,
    Couched with perles whyte and rounde and grete.
    His sadel was of brend gold newe y-bete;
    A mantelet upon his shuldre hanginge,
    Bret-ful of rubies rede, as fyr sparklinge.
    His crispe heer lyk ringes was y-ronne,
    And that was yelow, and glitered as the sonne.
    His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citrin,
    His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn,
    A fewe fraknes in his face y-spreynd,
    Betwixen yelow and somdel blak y-meynd,
    And as a leoun he his loking caste.
    Of five and twenty yeer his age I caste.
    His berd was wel bigonne for to springe;
    His voys was as a trompe thunderinge.
    Upon his heed he wered of laurer grene
    A gerland fresh and lusty for to sene.
    Upon his hand he bar, for his deduyt,
    An egle tame, as eny lilye whyt.
    An hundred lordes hadde he with him there,
    Al armed, sauf hir heddes, in al hir gere.

    And some wore breast- and back-plates thick and large;
    And some woln have a Prussian sheld, or a targe;
    Some on hir legges were armed weel,
    And hadde an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
    Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old.
    Armed were they, as I have yow told,
    Everich after his opinioun.
    Ther mightestow seen with Palamon
    Lycurgus himself, the grete king of Trace;
    Black was his berd, and manly was his face.
    The eyeballs in the cercles of his heed
    They glaucen bitwixe yelow and reed.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## The Knight’s Tale — Excerpt (Modern English translation)

And like a griffin glared he round about  
From under bushy eyebrows thick and stout.

His limbs were large, his muscles hard and strong,  
His shoulders broad, his arms both big and long,  
And, as the fashion was in his country,

High in a chariot of gold stood he,

With four white bulls in traces, to progress.

Instead of coat-of-arms above harness,

With yellow claws preserved and bright as gold,

He wore a bear-skin, black and very old.

His long combed hair was hanging down his back,  
As any raven’s feather it was black:

A wreath of gold, arm-thick, of heavy weight,

Was on his head, and set with jewels great,

Of rubies fine and perfect diamonds.

About his car there circled huge white hounds,  
Twenty or more, as large as any steer,

To hunt the lion or the antlered deer;

And so they followed him, with muzzles bound,  
Wearing gold collars with smooth rings and round.

A hundred lords came riding in his rout,  
All armed at point, with hearts both stern and stout.

With Arcita, in tales men call to mind,  
The great Emetreus, a king of Ind,

Upon a bay steed harnessed all in steel,

Covered with cloth of gold, all diapered well,

Came riding like the god of arms, great Mars.

His coat-of-arms was cloth of the Tartars,  
Begemmed with pearls, all white and round and great.

Of beaten gold his saddle, burnished late;

A mantle from his shoulders hung, the thing  
Close-set with rubies red, like fire blazing.

His crisp hair all in bright ringlets was run,

Yellow as gold and gleaming as the sun.

His nose was high, his eyes a bright citrine,

His lips were full, his colouring sanguine,

And a few freckles on his face were seen,  
None either black or yellow, but the mean;

And like a lion he his glances cast.

Not more than five-and-twenty years he’d past.

His beard was well beginning, now, to spring;

His voice was as a trumpet thundering.

Upon his brows he wore, of laurel green,  
A garland, fresh and pleasing to be seen.

Upon his wrist he bore, for his delight,  
An eagle tame, as any lily white.

A hundred lords came riding with him there,  
All armed, except their heads, in all their gear,

wealthily appointed in all things;  
For, trust me well, that dukes and earls and kings  
Were gathered in this noble company  
For love and for increase of chivalry.

About this king there ran, on every side,  
Many tame lions and leopards in their pride.

And in such wise these mighty lords, in sum,  
Were, of a Sunday, to the city come  
About the prime, and in the town did light.

This Theseus, this duke, this noble knight,  
When he’d conducted them to his city,  
And quartered them, according to degree,

He feasted them, and was at so much pains  
To give them case and honour, of his gains,  
That men yet hold that never human wit,  
Of high or low estate, could better it.

The minstrelsy, the service at the feast,  
The great gifts to the highest and the least,  
The furnishings of Theseus’ rich palace,  
Who highest sat or lowest on the dais,  
What ladies fairest were or best dandling,  
Or which of them could dance the best, or sing,  
Or who could speak most feelingly of love,  
Or what hawks sat upon the perch above,  
Or what great hounds were lying on the floor —  
Of all these I will make no mention more;

But tell my tale, for that, I think, is best;  
Now comes the point, and listen if you’ve zest.

That Sunday night, ere day began to spring,  
When Palamon the earliest lark heard sing,  
Although it lacked two hours of being day,

Yet the lark sang, and Palamon sang a lay.

With pious heart and with a high courage  
He rose, to go upon a pilgrimage  
Unto the blessed Cytherea’s shrine  
(I mean queen Venus, worthy and benign).

And at her hour he then walked forth apace  
Out to the lists wherein her temple was,  
And down he knelt in manner to revere,  
And from a full heart spoke as you shall hear.

“Fairest of fair, O lady mine, Venus,  
Daughter of Jove and spouse to Vulcan,  
Thou gladdener of the Mount of Citheron,  
By that great love thou borest to Adon,  
Have pity on my bitter tears that smart  
And hear my humble prayer within thy heart.

Alas! I have no words in which to tell  
The effect of all the torments of my hell;  
My heavy heart its evils can’t bewray;  
I’m so confused I can find naught to say.

But mercy, lady bright, that knowest well  
My heart, and seest all the ills I feel,  
Consider and have ruth upon my sore  
As truly as I shall, for evermore,

Well as I may, thy one true servant be,  
And wage a war henceforth on chastity.

If thou wilt help, thus do I make my vow:  
To boast of knightly skill I care not now,  
Nor do I ask tomorrow’s victory,  
Nor any such renown, nor vain glory  
Of prize of arms, blown before lord and churl,

But I would have possession of one girl,  
Full richly in all manner of things.

For trusteth well, that dukes, earls, kings,  
Were gathered in this noble companye,  
For love and for increase of chivalrye.

About this king there ran on every part  
Full many a tame leon and leopard.

And in this wise these lords, all and some,  
Been on the Sunday to the city come  
About prime, and in the town alight.

This Theseus, this duke, this worthy knight,  
When he had brought them into his city,  
And inned them, every one in his degree,  
He feasteth them, and dooth so great labour  
To see them, and doon them all honour,

That yet men ween that no mannes wit  
Of noon estate ne could amend it.

The minstrelsy, the service at the feast,  
The great gifts to the most and least,  
The rich array of Theseus’ palace,  
Ne who sat first ne last upon the dais.  
What ladies fairest been or best dancing,  
Or which of them can dance best and sing,  
Ne who most feelingly speaketh of love;  
What hawks sit on the perch above,  
What hounds lie on the floor adown;  
Of all this make I now no mention;

But all the effect, that thinketh me the best;  
Now cometh the point, and hearken if ye lest.

The Sunday night, ere day began to spring,  
When Palamon the lark heard sing,

Although it were not day by hours two,  
Yet sang the lark, and Palamon also.

With holy heart, and with an high courage  
He rose, to wend upon his pilgrimage  
Unto the blissful Cytherea benign,  
I mean Venus, honourable and dignified.

And in her hour he walketh forth apace  
Unto the lists, where her temple was,  
And down he kneeleth, and with humble cheer  
And heart sore, he said as ye shall hear.

Fairest of faire, O lady mine, Venus,  
Daughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcan,  
Thou gladdener of the mount of Citheroun,  
For that love thou haddest to Adoun,  
Have pity of my bitter tears smert,  
And take my humble prayer at thine heart.

Allas! I ne have no language to tell  
The effects ne the torments of my hell;  
My heart may my harms not bewray;  
I am so confus, that I cannot say.

But mercy, lady bright, that knowest well  
My thought, and seest what harms that I feel,  
Consider all this, and rue upon my sore,  
As wisely as I shall for evermore,

And forth my might, thy true servant be,  
And holden war alway with chastity.  
That make I my avow, so ye me help.

I keep not of arms for to yelp,  
Nor I ne ask not to-morrow to have victory,  
Nor renown in this case, nor vain glory  
Of prize of arms blown up and down,

But I would have fully possession  
Of Emelye, and die in thy service;  
Find thou the manner how, and in what wise.

I reck not, but it may better be,  
To have victory of them, or they of me,  
So that I have my lady in my arms.

For though so be that Mars is god of arms,  
Your virtue is so great in Heaven above,  
That, if you list, I shall well have my love.

Thy temple will I worship evermore,  
And on thine altar, where I ride or go,  
I will do sacrifice, and thy fires feed.

And if ye will not so, my lady sweet,  
Then pray I thee, tomorrow with a spear  
That Arcita me through the heart pierce here.

Then reck I naught, when I have lost my life,  
Though that Arcita win her for his wife.

This is the effect and end of my prayer,  
Give me my love, thou blissful lady dear.”

When the orison was done of Palamon,  
His sacrifice he did, and that anon  
Full piteously, with all circumstances,  
Al tell I not as now his observances.

But at the last the statue of Venus shook,  
And made a sign, whereby that he took  
That his prayer accepted was that day.

For though the sign shewed a delay,  
Yet wist he well that granted was his boon;  
And with glad heart he went him home full soon.

Three hours unequal that Palamon  
Began to Venus’ temple for to goon.

Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelye,  
And to the temple of Diana gan hie.

Her maidens, that she thither with her ladde,  
Full readily with them the fire they had,  
The incense, the clothes, and the remnant all  
That to the sacrifice belong shall;

The horns full of mead, as was the guise;  
There lacked naught to do her sacrifice.

Smoking the temple, full of clothes fair.

This Emelye, with heart debonair,  
Her body washed with water of a well;  
But how she did her rite I dare not tell,  
But it be any thing in general;  
And yet it were a game to hear it all;  
To him that meaneth well, it were no charge:  
But it is good a man be at his large.

Her bright hair was kempt, untressed all;  
A coronet of green oak leaves  
Upon her head was set full fair and meet.

Two fires on the altar gan she beat,  
And did her things, as men may behold  
In Statius of Thebes, and those books old.

When kindled was the fire, with pitous cheer  
Unto Diana she spake, as ye may hear.

“O chaste goddess of the woods green,  
To whom both heaven and earth and sea is seen,  
Queen of the realm of Pluto dark and low,  
Goddess of maidens, that my heart hast knowe  
Full many a year, and wost what I desire,

As keep me from thy vengeance and thine ire  
That on Actaeon fell so cruelly.

Chaste goddess, well wost thou that I desire  
To be a virgin all my life,

Nor ever wish to be man’s love or wife.

I am, thou know’st, yet of thy company,  
A maid, who loves the hunt and venery,  
And to go rambling in the greenwood wild,  
And not to be a wife and be with child.

I do not crave the company of man.  
Now help me, lady, since thou may’st and can,  
By the three beings who are one in thee.

For Palamon, who bears such love to me,  
And for Arcita, loving me so sore,  
This grace I pray thee, without one thing more,  
To send down love and peace between those two,  
And turn their hearts away from me: so do  
That all their furious love and their desire,  
And all their ceaseless torment and their fire  
Be quenched or turned into another place;

And if it be thou wilt not show this grace,  
Or if my destiny be moulded so  
That I must needs have one of these same two,  
Then send me him that most desires me.

Behold, O goddess of utter chastity,  
The bitter tears that down my two cheeks fall.  
Since thou art maid and keeper of us all,  
My maidenhead keep thou, and still preserve,  
And while I live a maid, thee will I serve.”

The fires blazed high upon the altar there,  
While Emily was saying thus her prayer,

But suddenly she saw a sight most quaint,  
For there, before her eyes, one fire went faint,  
Then blazed again; and after that, anon,  
The other fire was quenched, and so was gone.  
And as it died it made a whistling sound,  
As do wet branches burning on the ground,  
And from the brands’ ends there ran out, anon,  
What looked like drops of blood, and many a one;

At which so much aghast was Emily  
That she was near dazed, and began to cry,  
For she knew naught of what it signified;  
But only out of terror thus she cried  
And wept, till it was pitiful to hear.

But thereupon Diana did appear,  
With bow in hand, like any right huntress,  
And said: “My daughter, leave this heaviness.  
Among the high gods it has been affirmed,  
And by eternal written word confirmed,  
That you shall be the wife of one of those  
Who bear for you so many cares and woes;  
But unto which of them I may not tell.

I can no longer tarry, so farewell.  
The fires that on my altar burn incense  
Should tell you everything, ere you go hence,  
Of what must come of love in this your case.”

And with that word the arrows of the chase  
The goddess carried, clattered and did ring,  
And forth she went in mystic vanishing;  
At which this Emily astonished was,  
And said she then: “Ah, what means this, alas!  
I put myself in thy protection here,  
Diana, and at thy disposal dear.”

And home she went then, the nearest way.  
This is the purport; there’s no more to say.

## Middle English (Chaucer) — Corrected from OCR

And lyk a gryffoun he gan lyke aboute  
With browes brade, and eek with lokkes blake.  
His limes were large, and manly everychon;  
His shuldres brode, and every lym theron,  
And as the wise was in his contree,  
Hye in a chaire of gold stood he.

With fourten white bulles in trassee  
He drow it with a loud and seemely prees;  
For in his shiel was no apparell oughte,  
But he was ragged as a beere y-wreght.

A beres sance he hadde upon his brest,  
Wroght with the pyle and gold and no more,  
And alle his heer was blac as any cole;  
A whyte coroune of laurer on his hede,  
Of which the stremes y-lad with riche ston,  
Of rubies and of cleer and brighte ston.

About his cart ther rennen houndes white,  
Twenty or more, as large as any stiere,  
To hunten wildde lyon or other beaste;  
And alle they had y-nome and coude no bite  
For muzzles bounden and with gleaming colers.

A hundred lordes with he rydeth in his route,  
Alle armed at point, with hearts bolde and stoute.

With Arcite, in tales men calle to minde,  
The grete Emetreus, kyng of Inde,  
Upon a baya stede, all armed in steel,  
Covered with cloth of gold, depyred weel,  
Came ryding as the god of werre, Mars.

His cote-armure was coveryd, large and brede,  
Begemeled with perles, round and—sooth to seyne—  
Of beaten gold his sadel brent and bleyne;  
A mantell from his chekes faste hym hong,  
Y-set with rubies rede, that blenden strong.

His cristen heer was rolled in curled gyttes,  
Y-yelowe as gold, and louche as the bright sonne.  
His nose was hye, his eyen bright and keene,  
His lippes fulle, his coler red of hewe,  
And here and there a spottes merily seene,  
Ne y-browed not neither pale nor blak.

Not mo than five and twenty wynter olde,  
His berd was new begun and semed yong;  
His voys was soun as trompe thurghout the hall.

Upon his brow a garland of laurer gree  
He wered, new-sprad and fair to see.

Upon his hond a foulen of the skye,  
An egle tame, as white as any lyly.

A hundred lordes more than he had eek,  
Alle armed save her hed, in al her leik.

[2181–2242]

THE CANTERBURY TALES

And welthily appoynted in alle thynges;  
For truste me wel, that dukes and erles and kinges  
Were gadred in this noble companye  
For love and for encrees of chivalrye.

About this kyng ther ran on every part  
Ful many a tame lyon and lepart.

And in this wise thise lordes, al and some,  
Ben on the Sonday to the citee come  
About pryme, and in the toun alight.

This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,  
Whan he hadde brought hem into his citee,  
And inned hem, euerych in his degree,  
He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labour  
To see hem, and doon hem al honour,  
That yet men wenen that no mannys wit  
Of noon estat ne coude amenden it.

The minstraleye, the service at the feste,  
The grete yiftes to the moste and leste,  
The riche array of Theseus’ paleys,  
Ne who sat first ne last upon the deys,  
What ladyes fairest been or best daunsinge,  
Or which of hem can daunce best and singe,  
Ne who most felyngly speketh of love,  
What haukes sytte upon the perch above,  
What houndes liggen on the floore adoun;  
Of al this mak I now no mencioun;

But al the effect, that thinketh me the beste;  
Now comth the poynt, and herkneth if ye leste.

The Sonday night, er day began to sprynge,  
Whan Palamon the larke herde synge,

Although it nere nat day by houres two,  
Yet song the larke, and Palamon also.

With hooly herte, and with an high corage,  
He roos, to wenden on his pilgrimage  
Un-to the blissful Cytherea benigne,  
I mene Venus, honourable and digne.

And in hire houre he walketh forth apace  
Un-to the listes, ther hire temple was,  
And doun he knelth, and with humble chere  
And herte soor, he seyde as ye shul here.

“Fairest of faire, O lady myn, Venus,  
Doughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcanus,  
Thou glader of the mount of Citheroun,  
For thilke love thou haddest to Adoun,  
Have pitee of my bitter teres smerte,  
And tak myn humble preyere at thin herte.

Allas! I ne have no langage to telle  
Th’ effectes ne the tormentes of myn helle;  
Myn herte may myn harmes nat biwreye;  
I am so confus, that I can noght seye.

But mercy, lady bright, that knowest weel  
Myn thought, and seest what harmes that I feel,  
Consider al this, and rewe upon my sore,  
As wysly as I shal for evermore,

And forth my might, thy trewe servaunt be,  
And holden werre alwey with chastitee;  
That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe.

I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe,  
Ne I ne axe nat to-morwe to have victorie,  
Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyn glorie  
Of prise of armes blowen up and doun,

But I wolde have fully possessioun  
Of Emelye, and die in thy servyse;  
Find thou the maner how, and in what wyse.

I recke nat, but it may bettre be,  
To have victorie of hem, or they of me,  
So that I have my lady in my armes.

For though so be that Mars is god of armes,  
Your vertu is so greet in hevene above,  
That, if yow list, I shal wel have my love.

Thy temple wol I worshipe evermo,  
And on thyn auter, wher I ryde or go,  
I wol don sacrifice, and fyres bete.

And if ye wol nat so, my lady swete,  
Than preye I thee, to-morwe with a spere,  
That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.

Than rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,  
Though that Arcita winne hir to his wyf.

This is the effect and ende of my preyere,  
Yif me my love, thou blisful lady deere.”

Whan th’ orisoun was doon of Palamon,  
His sacrife he dide, and that anon  
Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces;  
Al telle I noght as now his observaunces.

But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,  
And made a signe, whereby that he took  
That his preyere accepted was that day.

For though the signe shewed a delay,  
Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his boon;  
And with glad herte he wente him home ful sone.

The thridde houre, unequall, that Palamon  
Bigan to Venus’ temple for to goon.

Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye,  
And to the temple of Diane gan hye.

Hir maydens, that she thider with hire ladde,  
Ful redily with hem the fire they hadde,  
The incense, the clothes, and the remenaunt al  
That to the sacrifyce longen shal;  
The hornes ful of mead, as was the gyse;  
Ther lacked nothing to doon hir sacrifiise.

Smoking the temple, ful of clothes faire,  
This Emelye, with herte debonaire,  
Her body wessh with water of a welle;  
But how she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,  
But if it be any thing in generale;  
And yet it were a game to herne alle;  
To him that meneth wel, it were no charge:  
But it is good a man ben at his large.

Hir bright heer was kempt, untressed al;  
A coroune of grene oke on hir heed was sete,  
Upon hir heed was set ful fair and mete.

Two fyres on the auter gan she bete,  
And dide hir thinges, as men may biholde  
In Stace of Thebes, and those bookes olde.

Whan kindled was the fyr, with pitous chere  
To Diane she spak, as ye may here:

“O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,  
To whom both heven and erthe and see is sene,  
Quene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,  
Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe  
Ful many a yeer, and wost what I desire,  
As kepe me fro thy vengeaunce and thin ire  
That Actaeon aboughte cruelly.

Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I desire  
To be a mayde al my lyf,  
Ne never wol I be no love ne wyf.

I am, thou wost, yet of thy companye,  
A mayde, and love hunting and venerye,  
And for to walken in the wodes wilde,  
And noght to been a wyf, and be with childe.  
Noght wol I knowe companye of man.

Now help me, lady, sith ye may and can,  
For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee.  
And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,  
And eke Arcite, that loveth me so sore,

This grace I preye thee with-outen more,  
As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two;  
And fro me turne awey her hertes so,  
That al her hote love, and her desir,  
And al her bisy torment, and her fyr  
Be queynt, or turned into another place;

And if so be thou wolt not do me grace,  
Or if my destinee be shapen so,  
That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,  
As sende me him that most desireth me.

Beholde, goddesse of clene chastitee,  
The bittre teres that on my chekès falle.  
Sith thou are mayde and keper of us alle,  
My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,  
And whyl I live a mayde, I wol thee serve.”

The fyres brenne upon the auter clere,  
Whyl Emelye was thus in hir preyere;  
But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte.

For right anon oon of the fyres queynte,  
And quiked agayn, and after that anon  
That other fyr was queynt, and al agon;  
And as it queynt, it made a whistelinge,  
As doon these wete brondes in her brenninge,  
And at the brondes ende outran anon  
As it were blody dropes many oon;

For which so sore agast was Emelye,  
That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crie;  
For she ne wiste what it signifyed;  
But only for the fere thus hath she cryed,  
And wept, that it was pitee for to here.

And ther-with-al Diane gan appere,  
With bow in hond, right as a huntresse,  
And seide: “Doughter, stint thy hevinesse.

Among the goddes hye it is affermed,  
And by eterne word write and confirmed,  
Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho  
That han for thee so muche care and wo;  
But unto which of hem I may nat telle.  
Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.

The fyres which that on myn auter brenne  
Shul thee declaren, er that thou go henne,  
Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas.”

And with that word the arwes in the cas  
Of the goddesse clateren faste and ringe,  
And forth she wente, and made a vanisshinge;  
For which this Emelye astonied was.

And she seide: “What amounteth this, alas!  
I putte me in thy protectioun,  
Diane, and in thy disposicioun.”  
And hoom she gooth anon the nexte wey.  
This is the effect, there is namore to sey.

[2305–2366]

THE CANTERBURY TALES

The nexte houre of Mars following this,  
Arcite unto the temple walked is  
Of fierce Mars, to doon his sacrifyse,  
With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.

With pitous herte and high devotion,  
Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:

“O stronge god, that in the regnes colde  
Of Trace honoured art, and lord y-holde,  
And hast in every regne and every lond  
Of armes al the bridil in thy hond,  
And hem fortunest as thee list devyse,  
Accept of me my pitous sacrifyse.

If so be that my youthe may deserve,  
And that my might be worthy for to serve  
Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thine,  
Than preye I thee to rewe upon my pyne.

For thilke peyne, and thilke hote fyr,  
In which thou whilom brendest for desyr,  
When that thou usedest the grete beautee  
Of fayre yonge fresshe Venus free,  
And haddest hir in armes at thy wille,  
Al-though thee ones on a tyme misfille  
When Vulcanus had caught thee in his las,  
And founde thee ligging by his wif, alas!

For thilke sorwe that was in thin herte,  
Have routhe as wel upon my peynes smerte.

I am yong and unkonning, as thou wost,  
And, as I trowe, with love offended most,  
That ever was any lyves creature;  
For she, that dooth me al this wo endure,  
Ne reccheth never whether I sinke or flete;  
And wel I woot, er she me mercy hete,  
I moot with strengthe winne hir in the place;  
And wel I woot, withouten help or grace  
Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle.  
Than help me, lord, to-morwe in my bataille.  
For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,  
As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me;  
And do that I to-morwe have victorie.  
Mine be the travaile, and thin be the glorie!

Thy soverein temple wol I most honouren  
Of any place, and alwey most labouren  
In thy pleasaunce and in thy craftes stronge,  
And in thy temple I wol my baner honge,  
And alle the armes of my companye;  
And everemo, unto that day I dye,  
Eterne fyr I wol bifore thee finne.

And eke to this avow I wol me binde:  
My berd, my heer that hongeth long adoun,  
That never yet ne felte offensioun  
Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive,  
And be thy trewe servaunt whyl I live.

Now lord, have routhe upon my sorwes sore,  
Yif me victorie, I aske thee namore.”

The preyer stynt of Arcite the stronge,  
The ringes on the temple-dore that honge,  
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,  
Of which Arcite somewhat him agaste.

The fyres brende upon the auter brighte,  
That it gan al the temple for to lighte;  
And swete smel the ground anon up yaf,  
And Arcite anon his hand up-haf,

And yet more encens into the fyr he caste,  
With other rites mo; and atte laste  
The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk ringe.

And with that soun he herde a murmuringe  
Ful lowe and dim, that seyde thus, “Victorie”:  
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.

And thus with joye, and hope wel to fare,  
Arcite anon unto his inne is fare.

As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne.

And right anon swich strif ther is bigonne  
For thilke graunting, in the hevene above,  
Bitwix Venus, the goddesse of love,  
And Mars, the stierne god armipotent,  
That Jupiter was bisy it to stenten;

Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,  
That knew so many of aventures olde,  
Fond in his olde experience an art,  
That he ful sone hath plesed every part.

As sooth is sayd, elde hath greet avantage;  
In elde is bothe wisdom and usage;  
Men may the olde at-renne, and noght at rede.  
Saturne anon, to stinte stryf and drede,  
Al be it that it is agayn his kynde,  
Of al this stryf he gan remedie fynde.

“My dere doghter Venus,” quod Saturne,  
“My cours, that hath so wyde for to turne,  
Hath more power than wot any man.  
Myne is the drenche in the see so wan;  
Myne is the prison in the derk cote;  
Myne is the strangling and the hanging by the throte;  
The murmure, and the cherles rebelling,  
The groyning, and the pryvee empoysoning:  
I do vengeance and plein correccioun  
Whil I dwelle in the signe of the Leoun.

Myne is the ruine of the hye halles,  
And tumbling down of tourres and of walles  
Upon the myner and the carpenter.  
I strucke doun Samson, that piler shakere;  
And myne been alle sicknesse that biteth colde,  
Treasons, and alle engynes that ben olde;  
Myne is the glances, fader of pestilence.

Now wepe no more. I shal see, with diligence,  
That Palamon, who is youre owene knight,  
Shal have his lady, as ye holde it right.  
Though Mars may helpe his man, yet nathelees,  
Bitwix yow two must somtime spece be seene,  
And though ye be not of on charite,  
He shal be youre sires, and I shal fulfille your wille.”

Now wol I cease of goddes aboue,  
Of Mars and Venus, the goddesse of love,  
And telle yow now, as playnly as I can,  
The grete effect, for which I first bigan.

THE KNIGHT’S TALE

And more encens into the fyr he caste,  
With other rites mo; and at the laste  
The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk ringe.

And with that soun he herde a murmuringe  
Ful lowe and dim, that seyde thus, “Victorie”:  
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.

> There was no tigre in the vale of Galgophey,

> But from the ground infernal furie start,

> And lay there, moving not, as he were dead,

> And black he lay as ever coal or crow,  
> So ran the surging blood into his face.  
> Anon they carried him from out that place,  
> With heavy hearts, to Theseus' palace.  
> There was his harness cut away, each lace,  
> And swiftly was he laid upon a bed.  
> For he was yet alive and some words said,

> Men said, too, that Arcite should not die,  
> But should be healed of all his injury.  
> And of another thing they were right fain,  
> Which was, that of them all no one was slain,  
> Though each was sore, and hurt, and specially one  
> Who'd got a lance-head thrust through his breast-bone.  
> For other bruises, wounds and broken arms,  
> Some of them carried salves and some had charms;  
> And medicines of many herbs, and sage

> In all of which this duke, as he well can,

> Nor was there held any discomfiting,

> One man alone, surrounded by the foe,  
> Driven by arms, and dragged out, heel and toe,  
> And with his courser driven forth with staves

> It was not a disgrace to him at all;

> For which anon Duke Theseus let cry,

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE KNIGHT'S TALE (end)

So now may Jove have in my soul his part,
As in this world, right now, I know of none
So worthy to be loved as Palamon,
Who serves you and will do so all his life.
And if you ever should become a wife,
Forget not Palamon, the noble man.

And with that word his speech began to fail,
For from his feet up to his breast had come
The cold of death, making his body numb.
And furthermore, from his two arms the strength
Was gone out now, and he was lost at length,
Only the intellect — and nothing more —
Which dwelt within his heart, so sick and sore,
Began to fail when the heart felt death;
His eyes darkened, and he failed of breath.
But on his lady still he turned his eye,
And his last word was, “Mercy, Emily!”

His spirit changed its house and went away.
As I was never there, I cannot say
Where; so I stop, not being a soothsayer;
Of souls here naught shall I register;
Nor do I wish their notions now to tell
Who write of them, though they say where they dwell.

Arcite is cold; Mars guides his soul on high;
Now will I speak forthwith of Emily.

Shrieked Emily and howled now Palamon,
Till Theseus his sister took, anon,
And bore her, swooning, from the corpse away.
How shall it help to dwell the livelong day
In telling how she wept both night and morrow?
For in like cases women have such sorrow
When their good husband from their side must go,
And, for the greater part, they take on so,
Or else they fall into so great a malady
That, at the last, and certainly, they die.

Infinite were the sorrows and the tears
Of all — old folk and folk of tender years —
Throughout the town, at death of this Theban;
For him there wept the child and wept the man;
So great a weeping was there, ’tis certain,
As when Hector was brought back, newly slain,
To Troy. Alas, the pity that was there!
Tearing of cheeks and rending out of hair.
“Why wouldst thou be dead?” these women cry,
“Who hadst of gold enough, and Emily?”

No man might comfort then Duke Theseus,
Excepting his old father, Egeus,
Who knew this world’s mutations, and men’s own,
Since he had seen them changing up and down,
Joy after woe, and woe after happiness:
He showed them, by example, the process.

> “Just as there never died a man,” quoth he,
> “But he had lived on earth in some degree,
> Just so there never lived a man,” he said,
> “In all this world, but must be sometime dead.
> This world is but a thoroughfare full of woe,
> And we are pilgrims passing to and fro;
> Death is the end of every worldly sore.”

And after this he told them yet much more
To this effect, all wisely to exhort
The people, that they should find some comfort.
Duke Theseus now considered, with all care,
What place of burial he should make and prepare
For good Arcite, where it might best be,
And one most worthy of his high degree.
And at the last he took this resolution:
That where as first Arcite and Palamon
Had fought for love, with no man else between,
There, in that selfsame grove, so sweet and green,
Where he had had his amorous desires,
His complaint, and for love his hot desires,
He would make a pyre, and there the funeral
He might accomplish, wholly and withal.
And so he gave command to hack and hew
The ancient oaks, and lay them straight and true
In lengths well arrayed for to burn;
His officers, with swift and ready feet,
Turned and rode forth at his commandment.

And after this Duke Theseus hath sent
For a great bier, and it all over-spread
With cloth of gold, the richest that he had.
And of the same suit he clad Arcite;
Upon his hands he had white gloves; full meet;
Eke on his head a crown of laurel green,
And in his hand a sword both bright and keen.
He laid him bare, the visage on the bier;
Therewith he wept in pity, hard to hear.
And for the people should him see and all,
When it was day, he brought him to the hall,
Which roared of crying and the mournful sound.

Then came this woeful Theban Palamon,
With fluttering beard and matted, ashy hairs,
In clothes of black, all dropped with many tears;
And, surpassing others in her weeping, Emily,
The ruefullest of all the company.

And so, that every rite should be
More noble and more rich in his degree,
Duke Theseus let forth three steeds bring,
That trapped were in steel all glittering,
And covered with the arms of daun Arcite.
Upon these steeds, that were great and white,
There seten folk, of whom one bore his shield,
Another his spear up in his hands he held;
The third bore with him his Turkish bow;
Of burnished gold were quiver and the hameys;
And forth they rode at a slow and solemn pace
Toward the grove, as ye shall after hear.

The noblest of the Greeks that there were
Upon their shoulders carried the bier,
With measured pace, and eyes both red and wet,
Throughout the city, by the great main street,
Which was all spread with black, and wondrous high
Right of the same was all the street y-writ.
Upon the right hand went old Egeus,
And on that other side Duke Theseus,
With vessels in their hands of finest gold,
All full of honey, milk, and blood, and wine;
Eke Palamon, with full great company;
And after that came woeful Emily,
With fire in hand, as was the custom then,
To do the office of the funeral men.

Great labour and full great apparelling
Was at the service and the pyre-making,
That with his green top the heaven raught,
And twenty fathoms of breadth the arms were brought;
This is to say, the branches were so wide.
Full many a load of straw they did provide.
But how the fire was made to climb so high,
Or what the names were that the trees went by —
As oak, fir, birch, asp, alder, poplar, holm,
Willow, plane, ash, box, chestnut, linden, elm,
Laurel, thorn, maple, beech, yew, dogwood-tree —
Or how they were felled, shall not be told by me;
Nor how the wood-gods scampered up and down
Driven from the homes that they called their own,
Wherein they’d lived so long at ease and peace,
The nymphs, the fauns, the hamadryades;
Nor how the beasts, for fear, and all the birds,
Fled, when that ancient wood began to fall;
Nor how aghast the ground was by the light,
Not being used to seeing the sun so bright;
Nor how the fire was started first with straw,
And then with dry wood, riven thrice by saw,
And then with green wood and with spicery,
And then with cloth of gold and rich jewelry;
And garlands hanging with full many a flower,
And myrrh and incense, sweet as roses in a bower.
Nor how Arcite lay among all this,
Nor what vast riches lay about his body is;
Nor how that Emily — as was the manner —
Lighted the sacred funeral fire that day,
Nor how she swooned when men built up the pyre,
Nor what she said, nor what was her desire;
No, nor what gems men on the fire then cast
When that the white flame went high and burned fast;
Nor how one cast his shield, and one his spear,
And some their vestments on that burning bier;
With cups of wine, and cups of milk and blood,
Into that flame, which burned as wild-fire would;
Nor how the Greeks, in one huge wailing rout,
Rode slowly thrice all round about the pyre
Upon the left hand, with a loud shouting,
And three times more with weapons clattering,
While thrice the women there raised up a cry;
Nor how they led sad Emily homeward;
Nor how Arcite burned to ashes cold;
Nor aught of how the watch they kept that night,
Nor how the Greeks did play the wake-plays,
Who, naked, wrestled best, with oil anointed,
Nor who best bore him in those deeds appointed.
I will not even tell how they were gone
Home to Athens when the play was done;
But briefly to the point now will I wend,
And make of this my lengthy tale an end.

By process and by length of certain years
All ceased the mourning and the flowing tears
Of Greeks, as by one general assent;
And then, it seems, there was a parliament
At Athens, upon certain points and case,
Among the which one point spoken of was
To have with certain countries alliance,
And have fully of Thebans obedience.
Whereat this noble Theseus anon
Let send and bid the gentle Palamon,
Not telling him what was the cause and why;
But in his black clothes sorrowfully
He came at this commandment, in all haste.
Then Theseus sent for Emily.

When they were set, and hush was all the place,
And Theseus had mused a little space,
Ere any word came from his wiseful breast,
His eyes he fixed, there as he liked the best,
And with a sad visage sighed he still;
And after that right thus he said his will.

> “The primal Mover of the cause above,
> When He first made the fair chain of love,
> Greet was the effect, and high was His intent;
> Well knew He why, and what thereof He meant;
> For with that fair chain of love He bound
> The fire, the air, the water, and the ground
> In certain bounds, that they might not flee;
> That same First Mover,” then he said to me,
> “Has established, in this wretched world adown,
> Certain days and a duration
> To all that is engendered in this place,
> Beyond the which they may not pace;
> All may they yet those days well abridge;
> There needs no other authority to allege,
> For it is proved by long experience,
> But that I list to declare my sentence.

Then may men by this order well discern
That that same Mover stable is and eternal.
Well may a man know unless he be a fool
That every part derives but from the whole.
For Nature hath not taken her beginning
Of any party nor of a cantel of a thing,
But of a thing that perfect is and stable,
Descending so, until it be corruptable.
And therefore of His wise providence
He hath so well set His ordinance
That species of things and progressions
Shall endure by natural successions,
And not eternal be withouten lie;
This may you well understand and see.

Lo now the oak that has so long a nourishing
From time that it first beginneth springing,
And hath so long a life, as we may see,
Yet at the last all wasted is the tree.
Consider eke how that the harden stone
Under our feet, on which we tread and go on,
Yet wasteth it, as it lieth by the way.
The broad river sometime waxeth dry.
The great towns we see decay and wane.
Then may you see that all this thing hath end.

Of man and woman likewise may we see
That needs, in one or other of these two,
That is to say, in youth or else in age,
He must be dead — the king as well as page;
Some in their bed, some in the deep sea,
Some in the broad field, as men may see;
There helpeth naught; all go that selfsame way.
Then may I say that all this thing must die.

Who causes this but Jupiter the King?
He is the prince and cause of everything,
Converting all back to that primal well
From which it was derived, sooth to tell.
And against this, for every thing alive,
Of any state, it profits not to strive.
Then is it wisdom, as it seems to me,
To make a virtue of necessity,
And take with calm what we may not eschew,
And specially what unto us is due.
Who would complain at aught does folly plain,
And thus rebels against His potency.
And certainly a man hath most honour
In dying in his excellence and flower,
When he is certain of his high good name;
For then he gives to friend and self no shame.
And gladder ought a friend be of his death
When, in much honour, he yields up his breath
Than when his name grows feeble with old age;
For then forgotten is his former courage.
Hence it is best for all of noble fame
To die when they are highest in their name.

The contrary of this is wilfulness.
Why do we grumble? Why have heaviness
That good Arcite, chivalry’s fair flower,
Is gone with honour in his best-lived hour
Out of the filthy prison of this life?
Why grumble here his cousin and his wife
Of his welfare, who loved them so well?
Can he them thank? Nay, God knows, not tell
How they his soul and their own selves offend,
Though yet they may their desires not amend.

What may I prove by this long argument
Save that we all turn to merriment
After our grief, and give great thanks to Jove.
And so before we go from out this place
I counsel that we make, of sorrows two,
One perfect joy, lasting for aye for you;
And look now where the most of woe is here,
There will we first amend it and begin.

Sister,” quoth he, “you have my full consent,
With all the advice of this our Parliament,
That gentle Palamon, your own true knight,
Who serves you well with will and heart and might,
And so has ever since you first him knew —
That you shall of your grace his thirst subdue
By taking him for husband and for lord:
Lend me your hand, for this is our accord.
Let now your woman’s pity make him glad;
For he is a king’s brother’s son, by gad;
And though he were a poor knight-bachelor,
Since he has served you for so many a year
And borne for you so great adversity,
This ought to weigh with you, it seems to me,
For gentle mercy ought to pass mere right.”

Then said he thus to Palamon the knight:
“I think there needs but little sermonning
To make you give consent now to this thing.
Come near, and take your lady by the hand.”

Between them then was tied that nuptial band
Which is called matrimony or marriage,
By all the council and the baronage.

And thus with all bliss and melody
Hath Palamon been wedded unto Emily.
And God, that all this wide world hath wrought,
Send him his love, that dearly it hath bought.
For now is Palamon in all good weal,
Living in bliss, in riches, and in health;
And Emily him loveth so tenderly,
And he her serveth also faithfully,
That never was there any word between
Of jealousy, or any other spleen.
Thus ends Palamon and Emily;
And God preserve all this fair company!
Amen.

Here is ended The Knight’s Tale.

---

And thus, in all bliss and with melody,
Has Palamon now wedded Emily.
And God, Who all this universe has wrought,
Send him His love, who dearly it hath bought.
For now has Palamon in all things wealth,
Living in bliss, in riches, and in health;
And Emily loved him so tenderly,
And he served her so well and faithfully,
That never word once marred their happiness,
No jealousy, nor other such distress.
Thus ends Palamon and Emily;
And may God save all this fair company!
Amen.

## THE MILLER’S PROLOGUE

## HERE FOLLOWETH THE WORDS BETWEEN THE HOST AND THE MILLER

Whan that the Knight hadde thus his tale y-told,
In al the route nas ther yong ne old
That he ne seyde it was a noble storie,
And worthy for to drawen to memorye;
And namely the gentils everichoon.

Our Hoste laughe and swoor, "so moot I goon,
This gooth aright; unbokeled is the mail;
Lat see now who shal telle another tale:
For trewely the game is wel bigonne.
Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye conne
Somwhat to quyte with the Knightes tale."

The Miller, that for-dronken was al pale,
So that unnethe upon his hors he sat,
He nolde avalen neither hood ne hat,
Ne abyde no man for his curteisye,
But in Pilate's vois he gan to crye,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,
"I can a noble tale for the nones,
With which I wol now quyte the Knightes tale."

Our Hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale,
And seyde, "Abyd, Robyn, my leve brother,
Som bettre man shal telle us first another;
Abyd, and lat us werken thriftily."
"By Goddes soul," quod he, "that wol nat I;
For I wol speke, or elles go my wey."
Our Hoste answerde, "Tel on, a devel wey!
Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."

"Now herkneth," quod the Miller, "alle and some!
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke, I knowe it by my soun;
And therfore, if that I mis-speke or seye,
Wyte it the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye;
For I wol telle a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter, and of his wyf,
How that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe."

The Reeve answerde and seyde, "Stint thy clappe;
Lat be thy lewed dronken harlotrye.
It is a sinne and eek a greet folye
To apeiren any man, or him diffame,
And eek to bringen wyves in swich fame.
Thou mayst y-nogh of other thinges seyn."

This dronken Miller spak ful sone ageyn,
"And seyde, 'Love brother Oswald,—
Who hath no wyf, he is no cokewold.
But I sey nat therfore that thou art oon;
Ther been ful good wyves many oon,
And evere a thousand goode ayens oon badde,
That knowestow wel thy-self, but if thou madde.
Why artow angry with my tale now?
I have a wyf, pardee, as wel as thou.
Yet wolde I, for the oxen in my plough,
Take on me more than is ynogh,
As demen of myself that I were oon;
I wol believe wel that I am noon.
An housbond shal nat been inquisitif
Of Goddes privetee, nor of his wyf,
So he may finde Goddes foyson there;
Of the remenant nedeth nat enquere.'"

What sholde I seyn more, but this Miller,
He nolde his wordes for no man forbere,
But tolde his cherles tales in his manere;
Me thinketh that I shal reherce it here.
And therfore every gentil wight I preye,
For Goddes love, demeth nat that I seye
Of evel entente, but that I moot reherce
Hir tales alle, be they better or werse,
Or elles falsen som of my matere.
And therefore who-so list it nat y-heere,
Turne over the leef, and chese another tale;
For he shal finde ynowe grete and smale
Of storie-things that toucheth gentilesse,
And eek moralitee and holinesse;
Blameth nat me if that ye chese amis.

The Miller is a cherl, ye knowe wel this;
So was the Reeve, and othere many mo,
And harlotrye they tolden bothe two.
Avyseth yow, and putte me out of blame;
And eek men shal nat make ernest of game.

## THE CANTERBURY TALES

### HERE ENDETH THE PROLOGUE

## THE MILLER'S TALE

### HERE BEGINNETH THE MILLER HIS TALE

Whilom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
And of his craft he was a carpenter.
With him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler,
Had lerned art, but al his fantasye
Was turned for to lerne astrologie,
And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns
To demen by interrogaciouns,
If that men axed him in certein heures
Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures,
Or if men axed him what sholde bifalle
Of every thing; I may nat rekene hem alle.

This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas;
Of derne love he coude and of solas,
And ther-to he was sleigh and ful privee,
And lyk a mayden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone, withouten any companye,
Ful fetisly y-dight with herbes swote;
And he himself as swete as is the rote
Of licorys, or any cetewale.
His Almageste and bokes grete and smale,
His astrelabie, longinge for his art,
His algorism-stones layen faire apart
On shelves couched at his beddes heed;
His presse y-covered with a folding reed;
And al above ther lay a gay sautrye,
On which he made a nightes melodye
So swetely that al the chambre rong;
And "Angelus ad virginem" he song;
And after that he song the kinges note;
Ful ofte blessed was his mery throte.
And thus this swete clerk his tyme spente
After his frendes finding and his rente.

This Carpenter had wedded newe a wyf
Which that he loved more than his lyf;
Of eighteene yeer she was of age.
Jalous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage,
For she was wilde and yong, and he was old,
And demed him-self ben lyk a cokewold.
He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude,
That bad man sholde wedde his similitude;
Men sholde wedden after hir estat,
For youthe and elde is ofte at debate.
But sith that he was fallen in the snare,
He moste endure, as other folk, his care.

Fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al
As any weasel hir body gent and smal;
A ceint she werede barred al of silk,
A barmclooth eek as whyt as mome milk
Upon hir lendes, ful of many a gore.
Whyt was hir smok and brouded al bifore
And eek bihinde, on hir coler aboute,
Of col-black silk, withinne and eek without;
The tapes of hir white voluper
Were of the same suite of hir coler;
Hir filet brood of silk, and set ful hye:
And sikerly she hadde a likerous eye.

Ful smale y-pulled were hir browes two,
And tho were bent, and blake as any sloo.
She was ful more blisful on to see
Than is the newe perjonette tree;
And softer than the wolle is of a wether.
And by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether,
Tasseld with silk, and perled with latoun.
In al this world, to seken up and doun,
There nis no man so wys that coude thenche
So gay a popelote, or swich a wenche.
Ful brighter was the shyning of hir hewe
Than in the tour the noble y-forged newe.
But of hir song it was as loude and yerne
As any swalwe sitting on a beme.
Ther-to she coude skippe and make game,
As any kide or calf folwinge his dame.

Hir mouth was swete as bragget or the meeth,
Or herd of apples leyd in hay or heeth.
Winsinge she was, as is a joly colt,
Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.
A brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler,
As brood as is the bos of a buckler;
Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye;
She was a priemerole, a pyknesse nye
For any lord to leggen in his bedde,
Or yet for any good yeoman to wedde.

Now sire, and eft sire, so bifel the cas,
That on a day this hende Nicholas
Fil with this yonge wyf to rage and pleye,
Whyl that hir housbond was at Osneye,
As clerks ben ful subtile and ful queynte;
And prively he caughte hir by the queynte,
And seyde, "Y-wis, but if ich have my wille,
For derne love of thee, lemman, I spille."
And heeld hir harde by the haunche-bones,
And seyde, "lemman, love me al at-ones,
Or I wol dyen, also God me save!"
And she sprong as a colt doth in the trave,
And with hir heed she wryed faste away,
And seyde, "I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey.
Why, lat be," quod she, "lat be, Nicholas,
Or I wol crye out 'harrow' and 'alas!'
Do wey your handes for your curteisye!"

This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,
And spak so faire and profered hir so faste,
That she hir love him graunted at the laste,
And swoor hir ooth by Seint Thomas of Kent,
That she wol been at his comandement
Whan that she might hir leysur wel espye.
"Myn housbond is so ful of jalousye
That, but ye wayte wel and been privee,
I woot right wel I am but deed," quod she.
"Ye moste been ful derne, as in this cas."
"Nay, therof care thee noght," quod Nicholas,
"A clerk had litherly biset his whyle,
But if he coude a carpenter bigyle."

And thus they been acorded and y-sworn
To wayte a tyme, as I have told bifore.
Whan Nicholas hadde doon thus everydeel,
And thakked hir about the lendes weel,
He kist hir swete and taketh his sautrye,
And pleyeth faste and maketh melodye.

Than fil it thus that to the parish chirche,
Cristes owne werkes for to wirche,
This gode wyf wente on an haliday;
Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,
So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.
Now was ther of that chirche a parish clerk,
The which that was y-cleped Absolon.
Crul was his heer and as the gold it shoon,
And strouted as a fan large and brode;
Ful streight and even lay his joly shode.
His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos,
With Powles window corven on his shoos.
In hoses reed he wente fetisly;
Y-clad he was ful smal and proprely,
Al in a kirtel of a light wachet;
Ful faire and thikke been the pointes set;
And therupon he hadde a gay surplys
As whyt as is the blosme upon the ris.
A mery child he was, so God me save;
Wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave,
And make a charte of lond or acquitaunce.
In twenty manere coude he trippe and daunce
After the scole of Oxenforde tho,
And with his legges casten to and fro;
And pleyen songes on a small rubible;
Ther-to he song somtyme a loud quinible;
And as wel coude he pleyen on his giterne.

In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
That he ne visited with his solas,
Ther any galard tappestere was.
But sooth to seyn, he was somdel squaymous
Of farting, and speche daungerous.

This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,
Gooth with a sencer on the haliday,
Sensing the wyves of the parish faste;
And many a lovely look on hem he caste,
And namely on this carpenteres wyf;
To loke on hir him thoughte a mery lyf.
She was so propre and swete and likerous.
I dar wel seyn, if she had been a mous,
And he a cat, he wolde hir hente anon.

This parish clerk, this joly Absolon,
Hath in his herte swich a love-longinge
That of no wyf ne took he noon offringe;
For curteisye he seyde he wolde none.
The mone, whan it was night, ful brighte shoon,
And Absolon his giterne hath y-take,
For paramours he thoughte for to wake.
And forth he gooth, jolif and amorous,
Til he cam to the carpenteres hous
A litel after cokkes hadde y-crowe;
And dressed him up by a shot-windowe
That was upon the carpenteres wal.
He singeth in his vois gentil and smal,
"Now, dere lady, if thy wille be,
I preye yow that ye wol rewe on me,"
Ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge.

This carpenter awook, and herde him singe,
And spak unto his wyf and seyde anon,
"What! Alison! Herestow nat Absolon
That chaunteth thus under our youre wal?"
And she answerde hir housbond therwith-al,
"Yis, God wot, John, I here it everydel."

This passeth forth; what wol ye beter than wel?
Fro day to day this joly Absolon
So woweth hir that him is wo bigon.
He waketh al the night and al the day;
He kempte his lokkes brode and made him gay;
He woweth hir by menes and brocage,
And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;
He singeth brokkinge as a nightingale;
He sente hir piment, meeth, and spiced ale,
And wafres piping hote out of the glede;
And for she was of toune he profred mede.

For some folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,
And some for strokes, and some for gentillesse.
Somtyme to shewe his lightnesse and maiesty
He acted Herodes on a scaffold hye;
But what availeth him in this cas?—nay:
She loved so this hende Nicholas
That Absolon may blow his bukke-horn;
He gat naught for his labour but a scorn.
And thus she made of Absolon hir ape,
And all his ernest caste she made a jape.

For sooth is this proverbe and no lye:
Men seyn right thus, "Alwey the nye slye
Maketh the ferre love for to be looth."
For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth
Because that he fer was from hir sighte,
This nye Nicholas stood in his light.

Now bere thee wel, thou hende Nicholas!
For Absolon may waille and syngen "Alas!"
And so bifel it on a Saterday
This carpenter was goon til Osney;
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been to this conclusioun,
That he sholde play a certein subtiltee
To make the jealous housbond wene he

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## The Miller’s Tale

That Nicholas shal shapen him a wyle  
This sely jalous housbond to bigyle;  
And if so be the game wente aright,  
She sholde slepen in his arm al night,  
For this was his desyr and hir also.  
And right anon, with-outen wordes mo,  
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,  
But doth ful softe unto his chambre carie  
Bothe mete and drinke for a day or tweye,  
And to hir housbonde bad hir for to seye.  
If that he axed after Nicholas,  
She sholde seye she niste where he was,  
Of al that day she saugh him nat with yit;  
She trowed that he was in maladye,  
For, for no cry, hir mayde coude him calle;  
He nolde answere, for no-thing that mighte falle.

This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,  
That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,  
And eet and sleep, or dide what him leste,  
Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.  
This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle  
Of Nicholas, or what thing mighte him eyle,  
And seyde, “I am adrad, by Seint Thomas,  
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.  
God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!  
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;  
I saugh to-day a cors y-born to chirche  
That now, on Monday last, I saugh him wirche.  
Go up,” quod he unto his knave anoon,  
“Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon,  
Loke how it is, and tel me boldely.”

This knave gooth him up ful sturdily,  
And at the chambre-dore, whyl that he stood,  
He cryde and knokked as that he were wood: —  
“What! how! what do ye, maister Nicholay?  
How may ye slepen al the longe day?”  
But al for noght, he herde nat a word;  
An hole he fond, ful lowe upon a bord,  
Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe;  
And at that hole he looked in ful depe,  
And at the laste he hadde of him a sighte.  
This Nicholas sat gaping ever upright,  
As he had kyked on the newe mone.

Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister sone  
In what array he saugh this ilke man.  
This carpenter to blessen him bigan,  
And seyde, “help us, Seint Frideswyde!  
A man woot litel what him shal bityde.  
This man is falle, with his astromye,  
In som woodnesse or in some agonye;  
I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!  
Men sholde nat knowe of goddes privetee.  
Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man,  
That noght but only his bileve can!  

So ferde another clerk with astromye;  
He walked in the feeldes for to prye  
Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,  
Til he was in a marle-pit y-falle;  
He saugh nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,  
Me reweth sore of hende Nicholas.  
He shal be rated of his studying,  
If that I may, by Jesus, hevene king!  
Get me a staf, that I may underspore,  
Whyl that thou, Robin, hevest up the dore.  
He shal out of his studying, as I gesse” —  
And to the chambre-dore he gan him dresse.

His knave was a strong carl for the nones,  
And by the haspe he haf it up atones;  
Into the floor the dore fil anon.  
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,  
And ever gaped upward into the eir.  
This carpenter wende he were in despeir,  
And hente him by the sholdres mightily,  
And shook him harde, and cryde spitously,  
“What! Nicholay! what, how! what! loke adoun!  
Awake, and thenk on Cristes passioun;  
I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes!”  
Ther-with the night-spel seyde he anon-rightes  
On foure halves of the hous aboute,  
And on the threshfold of the dore withoute: —  
“Jesu Crist, and Seint Benedight,  
Blesse this hous from every wikked wight,  
For nightes verye, the white paternoster! —  
Where wentestow, Seint Petres soster?”

And atte laste this hende Nicholas  
Gan for to syke sore, and seyde, “Alas!  
Shal al the world be lost eftsones now?”  
This carpenter answerde, “what seystow?  
What! thenk on god, as we don, men that swinke.”  
This Nicholas answerde, “fecche me drinke;  
And after wol I speke in privetee  
Of certeyn thing that toucheth me and thee;  
I wol telle it non other man, certeyn.”

This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn,  
And broghte of mighty ale a large quart;  
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,  
This Nicholas his dore faste shette,  
And doun the carpenter by him he sette.  
He seyde, “John, myn hoste lief and dere,  
Thou shalt upon thy trouthe swere me here,  
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye;  
For it is Cristes conseil that I seye.

“Now, John, myn hoste lief and dere,  
Thou shalt upon thy trouthe swere me here,  
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye;  
For it is Cristes conseil that I seye,  
And if thou tell it man, thou art forlore;  
For this vengance shalt thou han therfore,  
That if thou wreye me, thou shalt be wood!”  
“Nay, Crist forbede it, for His holy blood!”  
Quod tho this sely man, “I nam no labbe,  
Ne, though I seye, I nam nat lief to gabbe.  
Say what thou wolt, I shal it never telle  
To child ne wyf, by him that harwed helle!”

“Now John,” quod Nicholas, “I wol nat lye;  
I have y-founde in myn astrologye,  
As I have loked in the mone bright,  
That now, a Monday next, at quarter-night,  
Shal falle a reyn and that so wilde and wood,  
That half so greet was never Noes flood.  
This world,” he seyde, “in lasse than in an hour  
Shal al be dreynt, so hidous is the shour;  
Thus shal mankynde drenche and lese hir lyf.”

This carpenter answerde, “Alas, my wife!  
And shal she drenche? Alas! myn Alisoun!”  
For sorwe of this he fil almost adoun,  
And seyde, “is ther no remedie in this cas?”  
“Why, yis, for gode,” quod hende Nicholas,  
“If thou wolt werken after lore and reed;  
Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed.  
For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe,  
‘Werk al by conseil, and thou shalt nat rewe.’  
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil,  
I undertake, with-outen mast and seyl,  
Yet shal I saven hir and thee and me.

“Hastow nat herd how saved was Noe,  
Whan that our lord hadde warned him biforn  
That al the world with water sholde be lorn?”  
“Yis,” quod this carpenter, “ful yore ago.”  
“Hastow nat herd,” quod Nicholas, “also  
The sorwe of Noe with his fellowship,  
Er that he mighte gete his wyf to shipe?  
Him hadde be lever, I dar wel undertake,  
At thilke time, than alle his wetheres blake,  
That she hadde had a ship hir-self allone.

“And therfore, wostow what is best to done?  
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing  
Men may nat preche or maken tarying.  
Anon go gete us faste in-to this inn  
A kneding-trogh, or elles a kimelin,  
For ech of us, but loke that they be large,  
In which we mowe swimme as in a barge,  
And han ther-inne vitaill suffisant  
But for a day; fy on the remenant!  
The water shal aslake and goon away  
About pryme upon the nexte day.

“But Robin may nat wite of this, thy knave,  
Ne eek thy mayde Gilte I may nat save;  
Axe nat why, for though thou aske me,  
I wol nat tellen goddes privetee.  
Sufficeth thee, but if thy wittes madde,  
To han as greet a grace as Noe hadde.  
Thy wyf shal I wel saven, out of doute,  
Go now thy wey, and speed thee heer-aboute.

“But whan thou hast, for hir and thee and me,  
Y-geten us thise kneding-tubbes three,  
Than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hye,  
That no man of our purveyaunce spyc.  
And whan thou thus hast doon as I have seyd,  
And hast our vitaille faire in hem y-layd,  
And eek an ax, to smyte the corde atwo  
When that the water comth, that we may go,  
And brok an hole an heigh upon the gable  
Unto the gardin-ward, over the stable,  
That we may frely passen forth our way  
Whan that the grete shour is goon away —  
Than shaltow swimme as myrie, I undertake,  
As doth the whyte doke after hir drake.

“Than wol I clepe, ‘Ho! Alisoun! ho! John!  
Be myrie, for the flood wol passe anon.’  
And thou wolt seyn, ‘Haile, maister Nicholay!  
Good morwe, I se thee wel, for it is day.’  
And than shul we be lordes al our lyf  
Of al the world, as Noe and his wyf.

“But of o thyng I warne thee ful right.  
Be wel avysed, on that ilke night  
That we ben entred into shippes bord,  
That noon of us ne speke nat a word,  
Ne clepe, ne crye, but been in his preyere;  
For it is goddes owne heste dere.  
Thy wyf and thou mote hange fer atwinne,  
For that bitwixe yow shal be no sinne  
No more in looking than ther shal in dede;  
This ordinance is seyd, go, god thee spede!

“Tomorwe at night, whan men ben alle aslepe,  
Into our kneding-tubbes wol we crepe,  
And sitten ther, abyding goddes grace.  
Go now thy wey, I have no lenger space  
To make of this no lenger sermoning.  
Men seyn thus, ‘send the wyse, and sey no-thing’:  
Thou art so wys, it nedeth thee nat teche;  
Go, save our lyf, and that I thee biseche.”

This sely carpenter goth forth his wey.  
Ful ofte he seith “Alas” and “Welaway,”  
And to his wife he tolde his privetee;  
And she was war, and knew it bet than he.  
What al this queynte cast was for to seye,  
But nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye,  
And seyde, “Alas! go forth thy wey anon.  
Help us to scape, or we ben lost echon;  
I am thy trewe verray wedded wyf;  
Go, dere spouse, and help to save our lyf.”

Lo! which a greet thyng is affeccioun!  
Men may dye of imaginacioun.  
So deep may impressioun be take.  
This sely carpenter biginneth quake;  
Him thinketh verraily that he may se  
Noes flood come walwing as the see  
To drenchen Alisoun, his hony dere.  
He wepeth, weyleth, maketh sory chere,  
He syketh with ful many a sory swogh.  
He gooth and geteth him a kneding-trogh,  
And after that a tubbe and a kimelin,  
And prively he sente hem to his in,  
And heng hem in the roof in privetee.

His owne hand he made laddres three,  
To climben by the ronges and the stalkes  
Unto the tubbes hanginge in the balkes,  
And hem vitailled, bothe trogh and tubbe,  
With breed and chese and good ale in a jubbe,  
Suffysinge right ynogh as for a day.  
But er that he hadde maad al this array,  
He sente his knave, and ek his wenche also,  
Upon his nede to London for to go.

And on the Monday, whan it drow to night,  
He shette his dore with-oute candle-light,  
And dressed al thing as it sholde be.  
And shortly after up they clomben alle three;  
They sitten stille wel a furlong-way.  
“Now, Pater-noster, clom!” syde Nicholay,  
And “clom,” quod John, and “clom,” seide Alisoun.  
This carpenter seide his devocioun,  
And stille he sit, and biddeth his preyere,  
Awaytinge on the reyn, if he it here.

The dede sleep, for wery bisinesse,  
Fil on this carpenter right, as I gesse,  
About corfew-tyme, or litel more;  
For travail of his goost he groneth sore,  
And eft he routeth, for his heed mislay.  
Doun of the laddre stalketh Nicholay,  
And Alisoun, ful softe adoun she spedde;  
Withouten wordes mo, they goon to bedde  
Ther-as the carpenter is wont to ly.  
Ther was the revel and the melodye;  
And thus lith Alisoun and Nicholas,  
In bisinesse of mirthe and of solas,  
Til that the belle of laudes gan to ringe,  
And freres in the chauncel gonne singe.

This parish-clerk, this amorous Absolon,  
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,  
Upon the Monday was at Osney way  
With companye, him to disporte and pleye,  
And axed up-on cas a cloisterer  
Ful prively after John the carpenter;  
And he drough him a-part out of the chirche,  
And seyde, “I noot, I saugh him here nat wirche  
Sin Saturday; I trow that he be went  
For timber, ther our abbot hath him sent;  
For he is wont for timber for to go,  
And dwellen at the grange a day or two;  
Or elles he is at his hous, certeyn;  
Wher that he be, I can nat sothly seyn.”

This Absolon ful joly was and light,  
And thoghte, “now is tyme wake al night;  
For sikirly I saugh him nat stiringe  
Aboute his dore sin day bigan to springe.  
So moot I thrive, I shal, at cokkes crowe,  
Ful prively knokken at his windowe  
That stant ful lowe upon his boures wal.  
To Alisoun now wol I tellen al  
My love-longing, for yet I shal nat misse  
That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse.  
Som maner confort shal I have, parfay,  
My mouth hath icched al this long day;  
That is a signe of kissing atte leste.  
Al night me mette eke, I was at a feste.  
Therfor I wol gon slepe an houre or tweye,  
And al the night than wol I wake and pleye.”

Whan that the first cok hath crowe, anon  
Up rist this joly lover Absolon,  
And him arrayeth gay, at point-devys.  
But first he cheweth greyn and lycorys,  
To smellen swete, er he hadde kembd his heer;  
Under his tonge a trewe love he bere,  
For ther-by wende he to ben gracious.  
He rometh to the carpenteres hous,  
And stille he stant under the shot-window;  
Unto his brest it raughte, it was so lowe;  
And softe he cogheth with a sem-soun: —

“What do ye, hony-comb, swete Alisoun?  
My faire brid, my swete cinnamome,  
Awaketh, lemman myn, and speketh to me!  
Weil litel thenken ye upon my wo,  
That for your love I swete ther I go.  
No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;  
I moorne as doth a lamb after the tete.  
Y-wis, lemman, I have swich love-longinge,  
That lyk a turtel trewe is my moorninge;  
I may nat ete no more than doth a mayde.”

“Go fro the window, Jakke fool,” she sayde,  
“As help me God, it wol nat be ‘come kisse me’;  
I love another, and elles I were to blame,  
Weil bet than thee, by Jesu, Absolon!  
Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston,  
And lat me slepe, a twenty devel wey!”

“Alas,” quod Absolon, “and weylaway!  
That trewe love was ever so yvel biset!  
Than kisse me, sin it may be no bet,  
For Jesu love and for the love of me.”  
“Wiltow than go thy wey ther-with?” quod she.  
“Ye, certes, lemman,” quod this Absolon.  
“Thanne make thee redy,” quod she, “I come anon”;  
And unto Nicholas she seyde stille,  
“Now hust, and thou shalt laughen al thy fille.”

This Absolon doun sette him on his knees,  
And seyde, “I am a lord at alle degrees;  
For after this I hope ther cometh more!  
Lemman, thy grace, and swete brid, thyn ore!”  
The window she undoth, and that in haste,  
“Have do,” quod she, “come of, and speed thee faste,  
Lest that our neighbores thee espye.”  
This Absolon gan wipe his mouth ful drye;  
Derk was the night as pich, or as the cole.  
And at the window out she putte hir hole,  
And Absolon him fel no bet ne wers.  
But with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers  
Ful savourly, er he was war of this.

Abak he sterte, and thoghte it was amis,  
For wel he wiste a womman hath no berd;  
He felte a thing al rough and long y-herd,  
And seyde, “Fy! Alas! what have I do?”  
“Tehee!” quod she, and clapte the window to;  
And Absolon goth forth a sory pas.  
“A berd, a berd!” quod hende Nicholas,  
“By goddes corpus, this goth faire and weel!”  
This sely Absolon herde every deel,  
And on his lippe he gan for anger byte;  
And to him-self he seyde, “I shal thee quyte!”

And Absolon no better felt ne wers...

> And to himself he said, “I will requite!”

Who vigorously rubbed and scrubbed his lips  
With dust, with sand, with straw, with cloth, with chips;  
But Absalom, and often cried “Alas!  
My soul I give now unto Sathanas,  
For rather far than own this town,” said he,  
“For this despite, it's well revenged I'd be.  
Alas,” said he, “from her I never blenched!”  
His hot love was grown cold, aye and all quenched;  
For, from the moment that he'd kissed her arse,  
For paramours he didn't care a curse,  
For he was healed of all his malady;  
Indeed all paramours he did defy,  
And wept as does a child that has been beat.

With silent step he went across the street  
Unto a smith whom men called Dan Jarvis,  
Who in his smithy forged plow parts, that is  
He sharpened shares and coulters busily.  
This Absalom he knocked all easily,  
And said: “Unbar here, Jarvis, for I come.”  
“What! Who are you?”  
“It's I, it's Absalom.”  
“What! Absalom! For Jesus Christ's sweet tree,  
Why are you up so early? Ben's cite!  
What ails you now, man? Some gay girl, God knows,  
Has brought you on the jump to my bellows;  
By Saint Neot, you know well what I mean.”

This Absalom cared not a single bean  
For all this play, nor one word back he gave;  
He'd more tow on his distaff, had this knave,  
Than Jarvis knew, and said he: “Friend so dear,  
This red-hot coulter in the fireplace here,  
Lend it to me, I have a need for it,  
And I'll return it after just a bit.”  
Jarvis replied: “Certainly, were it gold  
Or a purse filled with yellow coins untold,  
Yet should you have it, as I am true smith;  
But eh, Christ's foe! What will you do therewith?”  
“Let that,” said Absalom, “be as it may;  
I'll tell you all tomorrow, when it's day” —  
And caught the coulter then by the cold steel  
And softly from the smithy door did steal  
And went again up to the woodwright's wall.

He coughed at first, and then he knocked withal  
Upon the window, as before, with care.  
This Alison replied: “Now who is there?  
And who knocks so? I'll warrant it's a thief.”  
“Why no,” quoth he, “God knows, my sweet roseleaf,  
I am your Absalom, my own darling!  
Of gold,” quoth he, “I have brought you a ring;  
My mother gave it me, as I'll be saved;  
Fine gold it is, and it is well engraved;  
This will I give you for another kiss.”

This Nicholas had risen for a piss,  
And thought that it would carry on the jape  
To have his arse kissed by this jack-a-nape.  
And so he opened window hastily,  
And put his arse out thereat, quietly,  
Over the buttocks, showing the whole bum;  
And thereto said this clerk, this Absalom,  
“Speak, sweet bird, I know not where thou art.”

This Nicholas anon let flee a fart,  
As great as it had been a thunder-dent,  
That with the stroke he was almost y-blent;  
And he was ready with his iron hot,  
And Nicholas amid the arse he smote.  
Off went the skin a hand-breadth about,  
The hot coulter burned so his tout,  
And for the smart he wended for to die.  
As he were wood, for woe he gan to cry —  
“Help! Water! Water! Help, for God's dear heart!”

This carpenter out of his slumber sterte,  
And heard one cry “water” as he were wood,  
And thought, “Alas! Now comes Noel's flood!”  
He set him up withouten words more,  
And with his axe he smote the cord a-two,  
And down goeth all; he found neither to sell,  
Nor bread nor ale, till he came to the floor;  
And there aswoon he lay.

Up started Alison, and Nicholas,  
And cried “Out!” and “Harrow!” in the street.  
The neighbours, both small and great, in running,  
Came forth to gawk upon this man.  
He yet aswoon lay, both pale and wan;  
For with the fall he had broken his arm;  
But stand he must unto his own harm.  
For when he spake, he was anon borne down  
With clever Nicholas and Alisoun.  
They told every man that he was wood.  
He was aghast so of “Noel's flood”  
Through fantasy, that of his vanity  
He had bought him kneading-tubs — three.  
And had them hanged in the roof above;  
And that he prayed them, for God's love,  
To sit in the roof to keep him company.

The folk began to laugh at his fantasy;  
Into the roof they peered and they gaped,  
And turned all his harm unto a jape.  
For whatso that this carpenter answered,  
It was for nought; no man his reason heard;  
With oaths great he was so sworn adown,  
That he was holden wood in all the town;  
For every clerk anon-right held with other.  
They said, “The man is wood, my lieve brother;”  
And every wight gan laugh of this strife.

Thus swived was the carpenter's wife,  
For all his keeping and his jealousy;  
And Absalom hath kissed her nether eye;  
And Nicholas is scalded in the tout.  
This tale is done, and God save all the rout!

The carpenter's corruption.

HERE ENDETH THE MILLER HIS TALE

## THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE

When folk had laughed their fill at this nice pass  
Of Absalom and clever Nicholas,  
Then divers folk diversely had their say;  
And most of them were well amused and gay,  
Nor at this tale did I see one man grieve,  
Save it were only old Oswald the reeve,  
Because he was a carpenter by craft.  
A little anger in his heart was left,  
And he began to grouse and blame a bit.

“S' help me,” said he, “full well could I be quit  
With blinding of a haughty miller's eye,  
If I but chose to speak of ribaldry.  
But I am old; I will not play, for age;  
Grass time is done, my fodder is now forage,  
This white top advertises my old years,  
My heart, too, is as mouldy as my hairs,  
Unless I fare like medlar, all perverse.  
For that fruit's never ripe until it's worse,  
And falls among the refuse or in straw.  
We ancient men, I fear, obey this law:  
Until we're rotten we cannot be ripe;  
We dance, indeed, the while the world will pipe.  
Desire sticks in our nature like a nail  
To have, if hoary head, a verdant tail,  
As has the leek; for though our strength be gone,  
Our wish is yet for folly till life's done.  
For when we may not act, then will we speak;  
Yet in our ashes is there fire to reek.  
“Four embers have we, which I shall confess:  
Boasting and lying, anger, covetousness;  
These four remaining sparks belong to eld.  
Our ancient limbs may well be hard to wield,  
But lust will never fail us, that is truth.  
And yet I have had always a colt's tooth,  
As many years as now are past and done  
Since first my tap of life began to run.  
For certainly, when I was born, I know  
Death turned my tap of life and let it flow;  
And ever since that day the tap has run  
Till nearly empty now is all the tun.  
The stream of life now drips upon the chime;  
The silly tongue may well ring out the time  
Of wretchedness that passed so long before;  
For oldsters, save for dotage, there's no more.”

Now when our host had heard this sermoning,  
He then did speak as lordly as a king;  
He said: “To what amounts, now, all this wit?  
Why should we talk all day of holy writ?  
The devil makes a steward for to preach,  
And of a cobbler, a sailor or a leech.  
Tell forth your tale, and do not waste the time.  
Lo, Deptford! And it is half-way to prime.  
Lo, Greenwich town that many a scoundrel's in;  
It were all time thy tale to beginne.”

“Now, sirs,” quod this Oswald the reeve,  
“I pray you all that ye not you grieve,  
Though I answer and somewhat twitch his hood;  
For lawful is with force force of-should.  
This drunken miller hath told us here  
How that beguiled was a carpenter,  
Peradventure in scorn, for I am one.  
And, by your leave, I shall him quite anon;  
Right in his churl's terms will I speak.  
I pray to God his neck mote break;  
He can well in my eye seen a stalk,  
But in his own he can not see a balk.”

## THE REEVE'S TALE

HERE BEGINNETH THE REEVE'S TALE

At Trumpington, not far from Cambridge,  
There goes a brook and over that a bridge,  
Upon the which brook there stands a mill;  
And this is verily truth that I you tell.  
A miller was there dwelling many a day;  
As any peacock he was proud and gay.  
Piping he could and fishing and nets to set,  
And turn cups, and wrestle and to shoot;  
And by his belt he bore a long panade,  
And of a sword full trenchant was the blade.  
A jolly popper bore he in his pouch;  
There was no man for peril durst him touch.  
A Sheffield whittle bore he in his hose;  
Round was his face, and camus was his nose.  
As pilèd as an ape was his skull.  
He was a market-beater to the full.  
There durst no wight lay hand upon him;  
That he ne swore he should anon abegge.  
A thief he was forsooth of corn and meal,  
And that a sly, and usant for to steal.  
His name was hight, ingenious Simkin.  
A wife he had, come of noble kin;  
The parson of the town her father was.  
With her he gave full many a pan of brass.  
For that Simkin should in his blood allye.  
She was y-fostered in a nunnery;  
For Simkin would no wife, as he said,  
But she were well nourished and a maid,  
To save his estate of yeomanrye.  
And she was proud, and pert as is a pie.  
A full fair sight was it upon them two;  
On holy-days before his wife would he go  
With his tippet bound about his head,  
And she came after in a gown of red;  
And Simkin had hose of the same.  
There durst no wight call her but “dame.”  
There was none so hardy that went by the way  
That with her durst rage or once play,  
But if he would be slain of Simkin  
With panade, or with knife, or bodkin.  
For jealous folk be perilous evermo,  
At least they'd have their wives to think them so.

Besides, because she was somewhat smoterlich,  
She was as dignified as water in a ditch;  
And full of scorn and full of backbiting.  
She thought a lady should her spare,  
For her kin and her nurture there  
That she had learned in the nunnery.

A daughter had they between them two  
Of twenty years, withouten any mo,  
Saving a child that was of half-year age;  
In cradle it lay and was a proper page.  
This wench thick and well y-grown was,  
With camus nose and eyes gray as glass;  
With buttocks broad and breasts round and high,  
But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.  
The parson of the town, for she was fair,  
In purpose was to make her his heir  
Both of his chattels and of his messuage,  
And strange he made it of her marriage.  
His purpose was to bestow her high  
Into some worthy blood of ancestry;  
For holy church's goods must be expended  
On holy church's blood that is descended.  
Therefore he would his holy blood honour,  
Though that he holy church should devour.

Great seeking hath this miller, out of doubt,  
With wheat and malt of all the land about;  
And namely there was a great college,  
Men clepe the Soler-hall at Cambridge,  
There was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.  
And on a day it happed, in a stounde,  
Sick lay the manciple of a malady;  
Men wende wisely that he should die.  
For which this miller stole both meal and corn  
A hundred times more than he did before;  
For theretofore he stole but courteously,  
But now he was a thief outrageously.  
For which the warden chid and made fare;  
But thereof set the miller not a tare;  
He cracketh boast, and swore it was not so.

Then were there young poor clerks two,  
That dwelt in this hall, of which I say.  
Willful they were, and lusty for to play,  
And, only for their mirth and revelry,  
Upon the warden busily they cry,  
To give them leave but a little stound  
To go to mill and see their corn ground;  
And boldly they durst lay their necks,  
The miller should not steal them half a peck  
Of corn by sleight, nor by force bereave;  
And at the last the warden gave them leave.

John hight that one, and Aleyn hight that other;  
Of one town were they born, that hight Strother,  
Far in the north, I cannot tell where.  
This Aleyn made ready all his gear,  
And on a horse the sack he cast anon.  
Forth goes Aleyn the clerk, and also John,  
With good sword and with buckler by their side.  
John knew the way, them needed no guide.

And at the mill the sack down he lays.  
Aleyn spake first, “All hail, Symond, by my faith;  
How fares thy fair daughter and thy wife?”  
“Aleyn! Welcome,” said Simkin, “by my life,  
And John also, how now, what do ye here?”  
“Symond,” said John, “by God, need has no peer;  
Him bodes serve himself that has no sway,  
Or else he is a fool, as clerks say.  
Our manciple, I hope, he will be dead,  
So works aye the wangles in his head.  
And forthy is I come, and eke Aleyn,  
To grind our corn and carry it home again;  
I pray you speed us hence that ye may.”  
“It shall be done,” said Simkin, “by my faith;  
What will ye do while that it is in hand?”  
“By God, right by the hopper will I stand,”  
Said John, “and see how that the corn goes in;  
Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,  
How that the hopper waggles til and fro.”  
Aleyn answered, “John, and wilt thou so,  
Then will I be beneath, by my crown,  
And see how that the meal falls down  
Into the trough; that shall be my disport.  
For John, in faith, I may be of your sort;  
I am as ill a miller as are ye.”

This miller smiled at their nicety,  
And thought, “All this is done but for a wile;  
They ween that no man may them beguile;  
But, by my thrift, yet shall I blind their eye;  
For all the sleight in their philosophy.  
The more quaint tricks that they make,  
The more will I steal when I take.  
Instead of flour, yet will I give them bran.  
‘The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,’  
As whilom to the world thus spake the mare;  
Of all their art I count not a tare.”

Out at the door he goes full privily.  
When that he saw his time, softly,

# THE REEVE’S TALE

He looked up and down till he had found  
The clerks' horse, where it stood fast bound,  
Behind the mill, under an arbour green;  
And to the horse he went, then, all unseen;  
He took the bridle off him and anon,  
When the horse was free, away he was gone  
Toward the fen, where wild mares ran therein,  
And with a neigh he went, through thick and thin.

This miller straight went back and no word said,  
But did his business and with these clerks played,  
Until their corn was fairly, fully ground.  
But when the flour was sacked and the ears bound,  
This John went out, to find his horse away,  
And so he cried: “Harrow!” and “Weladay!  
Our horse is lost! Alain, for Jesus' bones,  
Get to your feet, come out, man, now at once!  
Alas, our warden's palfrey's lost and lorn!”

This Alain forgot all, both flour and corn,  
Clean out of mind was all his husbandry.  
“What? Which way did he go?” began to cry.  
The wife came bounding from the house, and then  
She said: “Alas! Your horse went to the fen  
With the wild mares, as fast as he could go.  
A curse light on the hand that tied him so,  
And him that better should have knotted rein!”

“Allas!” quoth John, “Alain, for Jesus' pain,  
Lay off thy sword, and I will mine also;  
I am as fleet, God knows, as is a roc;  
By God's heart, he shall not escape us both!  
Why didn't you put him in the barn? My oath!  
Bad luck, by God, Alain, you are a fool!”

These simple clerks began to run and roll  
Toward the marshes, both Alain and eke John.  
And when the miller saw that they were gone,  
He half a bushel of their flour did take,  
And bade his wife go knead it and bread make.  
He said: “I think those clerks some trickery feared;  
Yet can a miller match a clerkling's beard,  
For all his learning; let them go their way.  
Look where they go; yea, let the children play;  
They'll catch him not so lightly, by my crown!”

Those silly clerks ran up and down with cries:  
“Keep! Keep! Stand! Stand! Here! Beware the rear!  
Go whistle thou, and I will watch him here!”  
But shortly, till it came to utter night,  
They could not, though they put forth all their might,  
That stallion catch; he always ran so fast,  
Till in a ditch they trapped him at the last.

Weary and wet, as beast is in the rain,  
Came foolish John, and with him came Alain.  
“Allas,” said John, “the day that I was born!  
Now are we bound toward mockery and scorn.  
Our corn is stolen; folk will call us fools,  
The warden and the fellows at the schools,  
And specially this miller. Weladay!”

Thus John complained as he went upon his way  
Toward the mill, with Bayard in his hand.  
The miller sitting by the fire he found,  
For it was night, and farther could they not;  
But, for the love of God, they him besought  
For shelter and for supper, for their penny.  
The miller said to them: “If there be any,  
Such as it is, why you shall have your part.  
My house is small, but you have learned art;  
You can, by metaphysics, make a place  
A full mile wide in twenty feet of space.  
Let us see now if this place will suffice,  
Or make more room with speech, by some device.”

“Now, Symond,” said John, “by Saint Cuthbert’s beard,  
Thou'rt always merry and hast well answered.  
As I've heard, a man shall take one of two things:  
Such as he finds, or take such as he brings.  
But specially, I pray thee, host dear,  
Give us some meat and drink and some good cheer,  
And we will pay thee, truly, to the full.  
With empty hand no man takes hawk or gull;  
Lo, here's our silver, ready now to spend.”

This miller to the town his daughter sent  
For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,  
And tied their horse, that it might not go loose;  
And in his own chamber made them a bed  
With sheets and with good blankets fairly spread,  
Not from his bed more than twelve feet, or ten.  
The daughter made her lone bed near the men,  
In the same chamber with them, by and by;  
It could not well be bettered, and for why?  
There was no larger room in all the place.

They supped and talked, and gained some small solace,  
And drank strong ale, that evening, of the best.  
Then about midnight all they went to rest.  
Well had this miller varnished his bald head;  
For pale he was with drinking, and not red.  
He hiccoughed and he mumbled through his nose,  
As he were chilled with humours lachrymose.  
To bed he went, and with him went his wife.

As any jay she was with laughter rife,  
So copiously was her gay whistle wet.  
The cradle near her bed's foot-board was set,  
Handy for rocking and for giving suck.  
And when they'd drunk up all there was in crock,  
To bed went Miller's daughter, and anon  
To bed went Alain and to bed went John.  
There was no more; they did not need a dwale.

This miller had so roundly bibbed his ale  
That, like a horse, he snorted in his sleep,  
While of his tail behind he kept no keep.  
His wife joined in his chorus, and so strong,  
Men might have heard her snores a full furlong;  
And the girl snored, as well, for company.  
Alain the clerk, who heard this melody,  
He poked at John and said: “Asleep? But how?  
Did you hear ever such a song ere now?

Lo, what a compline is among them all!  
Now may the wild-fire on their bodies fall!  
Who ever heard so outlandish a thing?  
But they shall have the flour of ill ending.  
Through this long night there'll be for me no rest;  
But never mind, 'twill all be for the best.  
For, John,” said he, “so may I ever thrive,  
As, if I can, that very wench I'll swive.

Some recompense the law allows to us;  
For, John, there is a statute which thus says,  
That if a man in one point be aggrieved,  
Yet in another shall he be relieved.  
Our corn is stolen, to that there's no nay,  
And we have had an ill fit all this day.  
But since I may not have amending now,  
Against my loss I'll make some fun, I trow.  
By God's great soul it shall not otherwise be!”

This John replied: “Alain, let me advise.  
The miller is a dangerous man,” he said,  
“And if he be awakened, I'm afraid  
He may well do us both some injury.”  
But Alain said: “I count him not a fly.”  
And up he rose and to the girl he crept.  
This wench lay on her back and soundly slept,  
Until he'd come so near ere she might spy,  
It was too late to struggle then or cry;  
And, to be brief, these two were soon as one.

This John lay still a quarter-hour or so,  
Pitied himself and wept for all his woe.  
“Alas,” said he, “this is a wicked jape!  
Now may I say that I am but an ape.  
Yet has my fellow somewhat for his harm;  
He has the miller's daughter in his arm.  
He ventured, and his pains are now all sped,  
While I lie like a sack of chaff in bed;  
And when this jape is told another day,  
I shall be held an ass, a milksop, yea!  
I will arise and chance it, by my fay!  
'Unhandy is unhappy,' as they say.”

And up he rose, and softly then he went  
To find the cradle for expedient,  
And bore it over to his own foot-board.  
Soon after this the wife no longer snored,  
But woke and rose and went outside to piss,  
And came again and did the cradle miss,  
And groped round, here and there, but found it not.  
“Alas!” thought she, “my way I have forgot.  
I nearly found myself in the clerks' bed.  
Eh, benedicite! but that were wrong!” she said.

And on, until by cradle she did stand.  
And, groping a bit farther with her hand,  
She found the bed, and thought of naught but good,  
Because her baby's cradle by it stood,  
And knew not where she was, for it was dark;  
But calmly then she crept in by the clerk,  
And lay right still, and would have gone to sleep.  
But presently this John the clerk did leap,  
And over on this goodwife did he lie.  
No such gay time she'd known in years gone by.  
He pricked her hard and deep, like one gone mad.

And so a jolly life these two clerks had  
Till the third cock began to crow and sing.  
Alain grew weary in the grey dawning,  
For he had laboured hard through all the night;  
And said: “Farewell now, Maud, sweet delight!  
The day is come, I may no longer bide;  
But evermore, whether I walk or ride,  
I am your own clerk, so may I have weal.”  

“Now, sweetheart,” said she, “go and fare thee well!  
But ere you go, there's one thing I must tell.  
When you go walking homeward past the mill,  
Right at the entrance, just the door behind,  
You shall a loaf of half a bushel find  
That was baked up of your own flour, a deal  
Of which I helped my father for to steal.  
And, darling, may God save you now and keep!”

And with that word she almost had to weep.  
Alain arose and thought: “Ere it be dawn,  
I will go creep in softly by my friend John.”  
And found the cradle with his hand anon.  
“By God!” thought he, “all wrong I must have gone;  
My head is dizzy from my work tonight,  
And that's why I have failed to go aright.  
I know well, by this cradle, I am wrong,  
For here the miller and his wife belong.”

And forth he went, a twenty devil's way,  
Unto the bed there the miller lay.  
He meant to have crept by his comrade John;  
And by the miller in he crept anon,  
And caught him round the neck and softly spake,  
Saying: “Thou, John, thou swine's-head, awake!  
For Christ's soul, and hear a noble jest.  
For by that lord that called is Saint James,  
As I have thrice in this short night,  
Swived the miller's daughter bolt upright,  
While thou hast as a coward been aghast.”

“You scoundrel!” cried the miller, “thou trespassed?  
Ah, traitor false and treacherous clerk!” quoth he;  
“You shall be killed, by God's own dignity!  
Who dares be bold enough to bring to shame  
My daughter, who is born of such a name?”  

And by the gullet then he caught Alain,  
And pitilessly he handled him amain,  
And on the nose he smote him with his fist.  
Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;  
And on the floor, with nose and mouth a-soak,  
They wallowed as two pigs do in a poke.  
And up they came, and down they both went prone,  
Until the miller stumbled on a stone,  
And reeled and fell down backwards on his wife,  
Who nothing knew of all this silly strife;  
For she had fallen into slumber tight  
With John the clerk, who'd been awake all night.

But at the fall, from sleep she started out.  
“Help, holy Cross of Bromholm!” did she shout,  
“In manus tuas, Lord, to Thee I call!  
Simon, awake, the fiend is on us all!  
My heart is broken, help, I am but dead!  
There lies one on my womb, one on my head!  
Help, Simkin, for these treacherous clerks do fight!”

John started up, as fast as well he might,  
And searched along the wall, to and fro,  
To find a staff; and she arose also,  
And knowing the room better than did John,  
She found a staff against the wall anon;  
And then she saw a little ray of light,  
For through a hole the moon was shining bright;  
And by that light she saw the struggling two,  
But certainly she knew not who was who,  
Except she saw a white thing with her eye.

And when she did that same white thing espy,  
She thought the clerk had worn a nightcap there.  
And with the staff she nearer drew and near,  
And, thinking to hit Alain on his poll,  
She fetched the miller on his bald white skull;  
And down he went, crying out, “Harrow! I die!”  
The two clerks beat him well and let him lie;  
And clothed themselves, and took their horse anon,  
And got their flour, and on their way were gone.  
And at the mill they found the well-made cake  
Which of their meal the miller's wife did bake.

Thus is the haughty miller soundly beat,  
And thus he's lost his pay for grinding wheat,  
And paid for both the suppers, so be told,  
Of Alain and of John, who've tricked him bold.  
His wife is taken, also his daughter sweet;  
Thus it befalls a miller who is a cheat.  
And therefore is this proverb said with truth,  
"Evil end to evil man, forsooth."  
The cheater shall himself be well cheated be.  
And God, who sits on high in majesty,  
Save all this company, both strong and frail!  
Thus have I paid this miller with my tale.

Here is ended the Reeve's Tale.

The cook from London, while the reeve yet spoke,  
Patted his back with pleasure at the joke.  
“Ha, ha!” laughed he, “by Christ's great suffering,  
This miller had a mighty sharp ending  
Upon his argument of harbourage!  
For well says Solomon, in his language,  
‘Bring thou not every man into thine house’;  
For harbouring by night is dangerous.  
Well ought a man to know the man that he  
Has brought into his own security.”

# INTRODUCTION TO THE MAN OF LAW’S PROLOGUE

## The Words of the Host to the Company — Modern English

Our good host saw well that the shining sun  
The arc of artificial day had run  
A quarter part, plus half an hour or more;  
And though not deeply expert in such lore,  
He reckoned that it was the eighteenth day  
Of April, which is harbinger to May;  
And saw well that the shadow of each tree  
Was, as to length, of even quantity  
As was the body upright causing it.  
And therefore by the shade he had the wit  
To know that Phoebus, shining there so bright,  
Had climbed degrees full forty-five in height;  
And that, that day, and in that latitude,  
It was ten of the clock, he did conclude,  
And suddenly he put his horse about.

“Masters,” quoth he, “I warn all of this rout,  
A quarter of this present day is gone;  
Now for the love of God and of Saint John,  
Lose no more time, or little as you may;  
Masters, the time is wasting night and day,  
And steals away from us, what with our sleeping  
And with our sloth, when we awake are keeping,  
As does the stream, that never turns again,  
Descending from the mountain to the plain.

And well may Seneca, and many more,  
Bewail lost time far more than gold in store.  
‘For chattels lost may yet recovered be,  
But time lost ruins us for aye,’ says he.  
It will not come again, once it has fled,  
Not any more than will Malkin’s maidenhead  
When she has lost it in her wantonness;  
Let’s not grow mouldy thus in idleness.

“Sir Lawyer,” said he, “as you have hope of bliss,  
Tell us a tale, as our agreement is;  
You have submitted, by your free assent,  
To stand, in this case, to my sole judgment;  
Acquit yourself, keep promise with the rest,  
And you’ll have done your duty, at the least.”

“Mine host,” said he, “by the gods, I consent;  
To break a promise is not my intent.  
A promise is a debt, and by my fay  
I keep all mine; I can no better say.  
For such law as man gives to other wight,  
He should himself submit to it, by right;  
Thus says our text; nevertheless, ’tis true  
I can relate no useful tale to you,

But Chaucer, though he can but lewdly  
On metres and on ryming craftily,  
Hath seyd hem in swich English as he can  
Of olde tyme, as knoweth many a man.  
And if he have not seyd hem, leve brother,  
In one book, he hath seyd hem in another.  
For he hath told of lovers up and down  
Mo than Ovid made of mention  
In his Epistelles, that been ful olde.

What sholde I tellen hem, sin they ben tolde?  
In youthe he made of Ceys and Alcion,  
And sithen hath he spoke of everichon,  
These noble wyves and these lovers eke.  
Who-so that wol his large volume seke  
Cleped the Seintes Legende of Cupyde,  
There may be seen the large woundes wide  
Of Lucrece, and of Babylonian Tisbee;  
The swerd of Dido for the false Enee;  
The tree of Phillis for hir Demophon;  
The pleinte of Deianire and Hermione,  
Of Ariane and of Hypsipyle;  
The baryne isle standing in the see;  
The drownde Leander for his Hero;  
The teres of Eleyne, and eke the wo  
Of Briseis, and of thee, Laodomea;  
The crueltee of thee, queen Medea,  
Thy little children hanging by the hals  
For thy Jason, that was of love so fals!  
O Hypermnestra, Penelope, Alceste,  
Your wifehood he commendeth with the beste!

But certeinly no word ne wryteth he  
Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee,  
That Iovede hir owne brother sinfully;  
Of swiche cursed stories I sey ‘fy’;  
Or elles of Tyro Apollonius,  
How that the cursed king Antiochus  
Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede.  
That is so horrible a tale for to rede,  
Whan he hir throuw upon the pavement.

And therfor he, of ful avysement,  
Nolde never wryte in none of his sermouns  
Of swiche unkinde abhominaciouns,  
Ne I wol noon reherse, if that I may.

But of my tale how shal I doon this day?  
Me were looth be lyked, doutelees,  
To Muses that men clepe Pierides —  
Metamorphoseos wot what I mene: —  
But nathelees, I recche noght a bene  
Though I come after him with hawk-bake;  
I speke in prose, and lat him rymes make.”

And with that word he, with a sober chere,  
Bigan his tale, as ye shal after here.

# THE MAN OF LAW’S TALE

## The Tale of the Man of Law — Modern English

In Syria, once, there dwelt a company  
Of traders rich, all sober men and true,  
That far abroad did send their spicery,  
And cloth of gold, and satins rich in hue;  
Their wares were all so excellent and new  
That everyone was eager to exchange  
With them, and sell them divers things and strange.

It came to pass, the masters of this sort  
Decided that to Rome they all would wend,  
Were it for business or for only sport;  
No other message would they thither send,  
But went themselves to Rome; this is the end.  
And there they found an inn and took their rest  
As seemed to their advantage suited best.

Sojourned have now these merchants in that town  
A certain time, as fell to their pleasance.  
And so it happened that the high renown  
Of th’ emperor’s daughter, called the fair Constance,  
Reported was, with every circumstance,  
Unto these Syrian merchants in such wise,  
From day to day, as I shall you devise.

This was the common voice of every man—  
“Our emperor of Rome, God save and see,  
A daughter has that, since the world began,  
To reckon as well her goodness as her beauty,  
Was never such another as is she;  
I pray to God in honour her sustene,  
And would she were of all Europe the queen.

In her is high beauty, without pride,  
Youth, without greenhood or folly;  
To all her works virtue is her guide,  
Humblesse hath slayn in her all tirannye.  
She is mirror of all courtesy;  
Her heart is very chamber of holiness,  
Her hand, minister of freedom for alms.”

And all this voice was sooth, as God is true,  
But now to purpose let us turn again;  
These merchants have done fraught their ships anew,  
And, when they had this blissful maiden seen,  
Home to Syria were they gone full fain,  
And do their needs as they had done of yore,  
And live in weal; I can say you no more.

Now so it fell that these merchants stood in grace  
Of him that was the sultan of Syria;  
For when they came from any foreign place,  
He would, of his benign and courteous way,  
Make them good cheer, and busily espy  
Tidings of sundry realms, for to learn  
The wonders that they might have seen or heard.

Among other things, especially  
These merchants told him of dame Constance,  
So great nobleness in earnest, certainly,  
That this sultan caught so great pleasance  
To have her figure in his remembrance,  
That all his lust and all his busy cure  
Was for to love her while his life might dure.

Peradventure in that large book  
Which men call the heaven was written  
With stars, when that he his birth took,  
That he for love should have his death, alas!  
For in the stars, clearer than is glass,  
Is written, God wot, whoso could it read,  
The death of every man, withouten drede.

In stars, many a winter ther-biforn  
Was written the death of Hector, Achilles,  
Of Pompey, Julius, ere they were born;  
The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,  
Of Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates—  
The death; but men’s wits are so dull  
That no wight can well read it at the full.

This sultan for his privy-council sent,  
And, shortly, of this matter for to pace,  
He did to them declare his whole intent,  
And said that, surely, save he might have grace  
To gain Constance within a little space,  
He was but dead; and charged them speedily  
To find out, for his life, some remedy.

By divers men, then, divers things were said;  
They reasoned, and they argued up and down;  
Full much with subtle logic there they sped;  
They spoke of spells, of treachery in Rome town;  
But finally, as to an end foreknown,  
They were agreed that nothing should gainsay  
A marriage, for there was no other way.

Then saw they therein so much difficulty,  
When reasoning of it (to make all plain,  
Because such conflict and diversity  
Between the laws of both lands long had lain)  
They held: “No Christian emperor were fain  
To have his child wed under our sweet laws,  
Given us by Mahomet for God’s cause.”

But he replied: “Nay, rather then than lose  
The Lady Constance, I’ll be christened, yes!  
I must be hers, I can no other choose.  
I pray you let be no rebelliousness;  
Save me my life, and do not be careless

The mother of the sultan, well of vices,  
Has heard the news of her son’s full intent,  
That he will leave the ancient sacrifices;  
And she at once for her own council sent;  
And so they came to learn what thing she meant.  
And when they were assembled, each compeer,  
She took her seat and spoke as you shall hear.

> “My lords,” said she, “you know well, every man,  
> My son intends to forgo and forget  
> The holy precepts of our Alkoran,  
> Given by God’s own prophet, Mahomet.  
>  
> But I will make one vow to great God yet:  
> The life shall rather from my body start  
> Than Islam’s laws out of my faithful heart!  
>  
> “What should we get from taking this new creed  
> But thralldom for our bodies and penance?  
> And afterward be drawn to Hell, indeed,  
> For thus denying our faith’s inheritance?  
>  
> But, lords, if you will give your sustenance,  
> And join me for the wisdom I’ve in store,  
> I swear to save us all for evermore.”  
>  
> They swore and they assented, every man,  
> To live by her and die, and by her stand;  
> And each of them, in what best wise lie can,  
> Shall gather friends and followers into band;  
> And she shall take the enterprise in hand,  
> The form of which I soon will you apprise,  
> And to them all she spoke, then, in this wise.

> “We will first feign the Christian faith to take;  
> Cold water will not harm us from the rite;  
> And I will such a feast and revel make  
> As will, I trust, to lull be requisite.  
>  
> For though his wife be christened ever so white,  
> She shall have need to wash away the red,  
> Though a full font of water be there sped.”

O sultana, root of iniquity!  
Virago, you Semiramis second!  
O serpent hid in femininity,  
Just as the Serpent deep in Hell is bound!  
O pseudo-woman, all that may confound  
Virtue and innocence, through your malice,  
Is bred in you, the nest of every vice!

> The moder of the sowdan, welle of vyces,  
> Espyed hath hir sones pleyn entente,  
> How he wol lete his olde sacrifyces.

O sowdanesse, rote of iniquitee,  
Virago, thou Semyram the secounde,  
O serpent under femininitee,  
Lyk to the serpent depe in helle y-bounde,  
O feyned womman, al that may confounde  
Vertu and innocence, thurgh thy malyce,  
Is bred in thee, as nest of every vyce!

This sowdanesse, whom I thus blame and wary,  
Let prively her council go their way.  
Why should I in this tale longer tarry?  
She rode unto the sultan, on a day,  
And said to him that she would renounce her lay,  
And christendom of priestes' hands fonge.  
Repenting, she had been heathen so long,  
Beseeching him to do her that honour,  
That she must have the Christian men to feast:  
“To please them I will do my labour.”  
The sultan saith, “I will do at your hest.”  
And kneeling thanketh her of that request.  
So glad he was, he wist not what to say;  
She kissed her son, and home she gooth her way.

> This sowdanesse, whom I blame and warie,  
> Leet prively hir conseil goon hir way.

## THE TALE OF THE MAN OF LAW

> To Wales was fled the Christianity  
> Of the old Britons dwelling in this isle;  
> That was their refuge in the wild meanwhile.  
> Yet ne’er were Christian Britons so exiled  
> But some of them assembled, privately,  
> To honour Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;  
> And near the castle dwelt of such men three.  
> But one of them was blind and could not see,  
> Save with the inner optics of his mind,  
> Wherewith all men see after they go blind.  
> Bright was the sun upon that summer’s day  
> When went the warden and his wife also,  
> And Constance, down the hill, along the way  
> Toward the sea, a furlong off, or so,  
> To frolic and to wander to and fro;  
> And in their walk on this blind man they came,  
> With eyes fast shut, a creature old and lame.  
> “In name of Christ!” this blind old Briton cried,  
> “Dame Hermengild, give me my sight again.”  
> But she was frightened of the words, and sighed,  
> Lest that her husband, briefly to be plain,  
> Should have her, for her love of Jesus, slain;  
> But Constance strengthened her and bade her work  
> The will of God, as daughter of his kirk.  
> The warden was confounded by that sight,  
> And asked: “What mean these words and this affair?”  
> Constance replied: “Sir, it is Jesus’ might  
> That helps all poor folk from the foul Fiend’s snare.”  
> And so far did she our sweet faith declare  
> That she the constable, before ’twas eve,  
> Converted, and in Christ made him believe.  
> This constable, though not lord of that place,  
> Kept it full strongly many winters’ space  
> Under Alla, king of all Northumberland,  
> Who was full wise and worthy of his hand  
> Against the Scots, as men may well hear;  
> But now I turn again unto my matter.  
>  
> Satan, that ever waits us to beguile,  
> Saw in Constance all her perfection,  
> And plotted how to pay her for her while;  
> He made a young knight that dwelt in that town  
> Love her so hotly, with foul affection,  
> That verily he thought his heart should spill  
> Unless of her he might once have his will.  
> He wooed her, but it availed him naught;  
> She would do no sin, by any way or might;  
> And, for despite, he plotted in his thought  
> To make her die a death of shame and blight.  
> He waited till the constable was away,  
> And privately, upon a night, crept he  
> Into Hermengild’s chamber while she slept.  
> Weary with waking in her orisons,  
> Slept Constance and Hermengild also.  
> This knight, through Satan’s temptations,  
> Softly to the bed approached and stood;  
> And cut the throat of Hermengild in two,  
> And laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,  
> And went his way—where God give him mischance!

---

Soon after came the constable home again,  
And also Alla, who was king of that land;  
And saw his wife so pitilessly slain,  
For which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;  
And in the bed the bloody dagger found  
Beside Dame Constance; ah! what might she say?  
For very woe her wit was all away.

King Alla was informed of this mischance,  
And told the time, and where, and in what wise  
That in a ship was found Dame Constance,  
As heretofore you have heard me devise.  
The king’s heart, full of pity, gan to rise,  
When he saw so benignant a creature  
Fall in distress and in misadventure.  
For as the lamb unto his death is brought,  
So stood this innocent before the king;  
The false knight that had wrought this treason bad  
Swore that it was she who had done this thing.  
Nevertheless, there was great mourning  
Among the people, saying, “They cannot guess  
That she hath done so great a wickedness;  
For they have seen her always virtuous,  
And loving Hermengild right as her life.”  
Of this bore witness each one in that house—  
Save he that slew the woman with his knife.  
The gentle king suspected motive rife,  
And thought he would inquire the truth entire,  
Deeper therein, the whole matter to learn.

Alas, Constance! thou hast no champion,  
Nor canst thou fight; it is a grievous day!  
But He who died for us upon the cross,  
And bound Satan (though yet he lies where he lay),  
So be thy doughty Champion this day!  
For, unless Christ a miracle make known,  
Withouten guilt thou shalt be slain full soon.

She set her down upon her knees and prayed thus:
> “Immortal God, who saved the fair Susanna  
> From lying blame, and Thou, O merciful Maid,  
> Mary, I mean, the daughter of Saint Anne,  
> Before whose Child the angels sing hosanna—  
> If I be guiltless of this felony,  
> My succour be, for else indeed I die!”

Have you not sometimes seen a pallid face  
Among the crowd of one that’s led to death—  
One who hath gotten no mercy or grace?  
Such pallor did upon her visage sit,  
So that all must mark it, full of horrid dread,  
Among the other faces in the rout.  
So stood fair Constance and looked all about.

O queens that live in all prosperity,  
Duchesses, and you ladies every one,  
Have pity now upon her adversity;  
An emperor’s daughter standeth there alone;  
She has no wight to whom to make her moan.  
O royal blood that stands there in such dread,  
Far are your friends away in your great need!  
King Alla showed such tender compassion—  
Since gentle hearts are full of all pity—  
That from his eyes the waters ran adown.

“Now send and fetch a book,” quoth he, “anon,  
And if this knight will swear that it was she  
Who slew the woman, then will we make clear  
The case; we shall appoint a judge to hear.”

A book of Gospels written in the British tongue  
Was brought, and on this Book he swore anon her guilt;  
But in the midst of his perjury a hand  
Smote him upon the shoulder-bone so hard,  
That down he fell as stunned as any stone,  
And both his eyes burst from his face in sight  
Of every person in that place that night.

A voice was heard in general audience,  
Saying: “Thou hast here slandered the guiltless  
Daughter of holy Church in high presence;  
Thus hast thou done, and further I will not press.”  
Whereat was all the crowd amazed and mute;  
They stood as men bewildered, every one,  
For dread of vengeance—save fair Constance alone.  
Great was the fear and also deep repentance  
Of those that had conceived so ill suspicion  
Against this simple innocent Constance;

And by this miracle and by her mediation,  
The king and many others in that place  
Were converted, thanks be to Christ’s grace!  
The false knight was slain for his foul untruth  
By judgment of King Alla—suddenly;  
Yet Constance had on his death great ruth.  
And after this, by Jesus of His mercy,  
King Alla took to wife full solemnly  
This holy maiden, that is bright and sheen,  
And thus hath Christ made Constance a queen.

But who was woful, if I shall not lie,  
At this wedding, save Donegild and none more—  
The king’s mother, full of tyranny?  
She thought her cursed heart would burst in twain;  
She would not that her son had done this thing;  
She deemed it shame that he should take  
So strange a creature unto his make.

I will not of the chaff or of the straw  
Make so long a tale as of the corn;  
What should I tell of all the royalty  
At marriage, or of which course went first,  
Who blew in trumpet or in horn?  
The fruit of every tale is but to say:  
They ate and drank and danced and sang and played.  
They went to bed, as was but right and meet;  
For though that wives be holy, heavenly things,  
They must in patience for a while put by  
Such necessaries as are pleasantings  
To folk that have them wedded with the ring,  
And lay a little by their holiness for sleep;  
For thus must be, and better may not be.

On her he got a man-child straight anon;  
And to a bishop and his constable eke  
He gave his wife to keep while he was gone  
To Scotland-ward, his foemen there to seek;  
Now fair Constance, who was so humble and meek.  
So long she kept in child until the time  
She held her chamber still, awaiting Christ’s will.

The time was come—she bore a knavish child;  
Mauricius at the font-stone they him call.  
The constable sent forth a messenger,  
And wrote unto his king that cleped was Alla,  
How that this blissful tidings was befell,  
And other tidings needful for to tell.  
He took the letter and forth he went his way.

This messenger, to do his own advantage,  
Unto the king’s mother rode with speed and craft,  
And saluted her full courteously in language:  
“Madame,” quoth he, “you may be glad and blithe,  
And thank God a hundred thousand times.  
My lady the queen hath child, withouten doubt,  
To joy and bliss of all this realm about.”

“Lo, here are letters sealed that say this thing,  
Which I must bear with all the haste I can;  
If you will send aught to your son the king,  
I am your humble servant, night and day.”  
Donegild answered: “As for this time, nay;  
But here tonight I would have you take your rest;  
Tomorrow I will say what I think best.”

This messenger drank deep of ale and wine,  
And while he slept his letters were stolen slyly  
Out of his box; and other letters counterfeited,  
Wrought subtly and full sinfully,  
Were sent unto the king regarding this affair,  
Claiming from the constable as source, as ye shall hear.

The counterfeit letter spake in this wise:
> “The queen delivered was of such a fiendish creature  
> That in the castle none so hardy was  
> To suffer there for any length of time.  
> The mother was an elf, or fairy come by chance,  
> By charms or sorcery—by such confusion—  
> And all good men hated her company.”

Sad was the king when he these letters saw;  
But to no man he told his sorrow sore;  
Yet with his own hand he wrote back anon:
> “Welcome what’s sent from Christ for evermore  
> To me, that am now learned in His lore;  
> Lord, welcome be Thy will, though hidden still;  
> My own desire is but to do Thy will.  
> Guard well this child, though foul it be or fair,  
> And guard my wife until my home-coming;  
> Christ, when He will, may send me an heir  
> More consonant than this to my liking.”

This letter sealed and inwardly weeping,  
Was taken to the same messenger straightway,  
And forth he went; there is no more to say.

O messenger given wholly to drunkenness,  
Strong is thy breath, thy limbs do falter aye;  
Thou bidd’st and brawlest, and betray’st all secrets;  
Thy mind is lost, thou janglest like a jay;  
Thy face is turned into a motley array.  
Where drunkenness can reign in any rout,  
There is no counsel kept, beyond a doubt.

O Donegild, I have no English fit  
To set against thy malice and thy tyranny!  
Therefore to the Fiend I fully thee resign;  
Let him write of thy foul treachery!  
Fie, mannish woman! Nay, by God, I lie not!  
Fie, fiendish spirit! for I dare well tell  
Though thou walk here, thy spirit is in Hell!

This messenger came back from the king again,  
And at the king’s mother’s court he alighted,  
And she was of this messenger full fain  
To please him in whatever way she might.  
He drank until his girdle was too tight;  
He slept and snored and mumbled drunken-wise  
All night, until the sun began to rise.

Again were letters stolen every one,  
And counterfeit letters crafted in this style:
> “The king commands his constable anon,  
> On pain of hanging by the high justice,  
> That he shall not suffer Constance in his realm  
> To stay beyond three days and a quarter of a tide;  
> But in the same ship as he her found,  
> Her and her young son and all her gear,  
> He shall put and crowd her from the land,  
> And charge her that she never eft come there.”

O my Constance, well may thy spirit fear,  
And sleeping in thy dream be sore distrest,  
When Donegild cast such cruel ordinance!

This messenger, when he awoke, forth rode  
Unto the castle by the nearest way,  
And to the constable delivered the letter;  
And when he read that piteous ordinance,  
Full oft he cried, “Alas!” and “Wey! alway!”  
“Lord Christ,” quoth he, “how may this world endure?  
So full of sin is many a creature!  
O mighty God, if this be Thy will,  
Since Thou art righteous Judge, how may it be  
That Thou wilt suffer innocents to spill,  
And wicked folk to reign in prosperity?  
O good Constance, alas! so woe is me  
That I must be thy torturer, or die  
On shameful death; there is no other way!”

Wept both the young and old there in that place  
When that the king this cursed letter sent;  
And Constance, with a deadly pale face,  
Upon the fourth day to her ship she went.  
Nevertheless she took in good intent  
The will of Christ, and kneeling on the strand,  
She said: “Lord, aye welcome be Thy command!  
He that kept me from false blame when I  
Was on the land among you, he can keep  
Me from all harm and from all future shame  
On salt sea, although I see not how;  
As strong as e’er He was, so is He now.  
In Him I trust and in His mother dear—  
She is to me my sail and eke my steer.”

Her little child lay weeping in her arm,  
And kneeling, piteously to him she said,  
“Peace, little son, I will do thee no harm.”  
With that she took her kerchief from her head,  
And o’er his little eyes she gently laid;  
And in her arm she lulled him fast asleep,  
And up to Heaven her eyes she cast and wept.

“Mother,” she said, “O maiden bright, Mary,  
True is that through woman’s enticement  
Mankind was lost and doomed evermore to die,  
For which Thy Son upon the cross was rent;  
Thy blessed eyes beheld all His torment;  
Wherefore there’s no comparison between  
Thy woe and any woe that men sustain.”

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

> “Thou sawest them slay Thy Son before Thine eyes;  
> And yet lives now my little child, I say!  
>  
> O Lady bright, to Whom affliction cries.  
>  
> Thou glory of womanhood, O Thou fair May,  
> Haven of refuge, bright star of the day,

> Pity my child. Who of Thy gentleness  
> Hast pity on mankind in all distress!  
>  
> “O little child, alas! What is your guilt,  
>  
> Who never wrought the smallest sin? Ah me,  
>  
> Why will your too hard father have you killed?  
> Have mercy, O dear constable!” cried she,  
>  
> “And let my little child bide, safe from sea;  
>  
> And if you dare not save him, lest they blame,  
>  
> Then kiss him once in his dear father’s name!”  

> Thou sawe thy child y-slayn bifor thyn yen,  
> And yet now liveth my litel child, parfay!  
> Now, lady bright, to whom alle woful cryen,  
> Thou glorie of wommanhede, thou faire may.  
> Thou haven of refut, brighte sterre of day,  
> Rewe on my child, that of thy gentillesse  
> Rewest on every rewful in distresse!  
>  
> O litel child, alas! what is thy gilt,  
> That never wroughtest sinne as yet, pardee,  
> Why wil thyn harde fader han thee spilt?  
>  
> “O mercy, dere constable!” quod she;  
>  
> “As lat my litel child dwelle heer with thee;  
> And if thou darst not saven him, for blame,  
> So kis him ones in his fadres name!”  

Therewith she gazed long backward at the land,  
And said: “Farewell, my husband merciless!”  

And up she rose and walked right down the strand  
Toward the ship; followed her all the press;  

And ever she prayed her child to cry the less;  

And took her leave; and with a high intent  
She crossed herself; and aboard ship she went.

> Ther-with she loketh bakward to the londe,  
> And seyde, “far-wel, housbond routhcless!”  
> And up she rist, and walketh doun the stronde  
> Toward the ship; hir folweth al the prees,  
>  
> And ever she preyeth hir child to holde his pees;  
> And taketh hir leve, and with an holy entente  
> She blesseth hir; and in-to ship she wente.  

Victualled had been the ship, ’tis true — indeed  
Abundantly — for her, and for long space;  

Of many other things that she should need  
She had great plenty, thanks be to God’s grace!  
Through wind and weather may God find her place  
And bring her home! I can no better say;  

But out to sea she stood upon her way.

> Vitailled was the ship, it is no drede,  
> Habundantly for hir, ful longe space,  
>  
> And other necessaries that sholde nede  
> She hadde y-nogh, heried be goddes grace!  
> For wind and weder almighty god purchace,  
> And bringe hir hoom! I can no bettre seye;  
> But in the see she dryveth forth hir weye.  

## HERE ENDETH THE SECOND PART

## HERE FOLLOWETH

Alla the king came home soon after this  
Unto his castle, of the which I’ve told,  

And asked for wife and child, whom he did miss.

The constable about his heart grew cold,  

And plainly all the story he then told,  
As you have heard, I cannot tell it better,  
And showed the king his seal and the false letter.  

And said: “My lord, as you commanded me,  
On pain of death, so have I done — in vain!”  

The messenger was tortured until he  

Made known the facts to all men, full and plain,  
From night to night, in what beds he had lain.  

And thus, by dint of subtle questioning,  
’Twas reasoned out from whom this harm did spring.  

The hand was known, now, that the letter wrote,  
And all the venom of this cursed deed.  

But in what wise I certainly know not,  
The effect is this, that Alla, for her meed,  
His mother slew, as men may plainly read,

## THE THIRD PART

Alla the king comth hoom, sone after this,  
Unto his castel of the which I tolde,  
And axeth wher his wyf and his child is.  

The constable gan aboute his herte colde.  
And pleynly al the maner he him tolde  
As ye han herd, I can telle it no bettre,  
And sheweth the king his seel and his lettre.  

And seyde, “lord, as ye comaunded me  
Up peyne of deeth, so have I doon, certcin.”  

This messager tormented was til he  
Moste biknowe and tellen, plat and plein,  
Fro night to night, in what place he had leyn.  
And thus, by wit and subtil enqueringe,  
Ymagined was by whom this harm gan springe.  

The hand was knowe that the lettre wroot,  
And al the venim of this cursed dede,  
But in what wyse, certaynly I noot.  

Th’effect is this, that Alla, out of drede,  
His moder slow, that men may pleinly rede,  
For that she traitour was to hir ligeaunce.  

Thus endeth olde Donegild with meschaunce.  

The sorwe that this Alla, noght and day,  
Maketh for his wyf and for his child also,  
Ther is no tonge that it telle may.  

But now wol I unto Custance go,  
That fleteth in the see, in peyne and wo,  
Fyve yeer and more, as lyked Cristes sonde,  
Er that hir ship approched unto londe.  

Under an hethen castel, atte laste,  
Of which the name in my text noght I finde,  
Custance and eke hir child the see up-caste.  
Almighty god, that saveth al mankinde,  
Have on Custance and on hir child som minde.  
That fallen is in hethen land eft-sone,  
In point to spille, as I shal telle yow sone.

She being false to her sworn allegiance,  
And thus old Donegild ended with mischance.  

The sorrow that this Alla, night and day,  
Felt for his wife, and for his child also,  
There is no human tongue on earth to say.  

But now will I back to fair Constance go,  
Who drifted on the seas, in pain and woe.  
Five years and more, as was Lord Christ’s command  
Before her ship approached to any land.  

Under a heathen castle, at the last,  
Whereof the name not in my text I find,  
Constance and her young son the sea did cast.  
Almighty God, Redeemer of mankind,  
Have Constance and her little child in mind!  
Who must fall into heathen hands and soon  
Be near to death, as I shall tell anon.

Down from the castel comth ther many a wight  
To gauren on this ship and on Custance.  

But shortly, from the castel, on a night,  
The lordes styward — God yeve him meschaunce! —  
A theef, that had reneyed our creance,  
Com into ship allone, and seyde he sholde  
Hir lemman be, wher-so she wolde or nolde.  

Wo was this wrecched womman tho bigon,  
Hir child cryde, and she cryde pitously;  
But blisful Marie heelp hir right anon;  
For with hir strugling wel and mightily  
The theef fil over bord al sodeinly,  
And in the see he dreynte for vengeance;  
And thus hath Crist unwemmed kept Custance.

Down from the castle came full many a wight  
To stare upon the ship and on Constance.  

But briefly, from the castle, on a night,  
The warden’s steward — God give him mischance!  
A thief who had renounced allegiance  
To Christ, came to the ship and said he should  
Possess her body, whether or not she would.

Woe for this wretched woman then began,  
Her child cried out and she cried, piteously;  

But blessed Mary helped her soon; the man  
With whom she struggled well and mightily,  
This thief fell overboard all suddenly,  
And in the sea was drowned by God’s vengeance;  
And thus has Christ unsullied kept Constance.

## AUTHOR

O foule lust of luxurie! lo, thyn ende!  

Nat only that thou feyntest mannes minde,  
But verraily thou wolt his body shende;  
Th’ende of thy werk or of thy lustes blinde  
Is compleyning, how many-oon may men finde  
That noght for werk som-tyme, but for th’entente  
To doon this sinne, ben outher sleyn or shente!  

How may this wayke womman han this strengthe  
Hir to defende agayn this renegat?  

O Golias, unmesurable of lengthe,  
How mighte David make thee so mat,  
So yong and of armure so desolat?  
How dorste he loke up-on thy dredful face?  
Wel may men seen, it nas but Goddes grace!  

Who yaf Judith corage or hardinesse  
To sleen him, Olofernus, in his tente,  
And to deliveren out of wrecchednesse  
The peple of God? I seye, for this entente,  
That, right as God spirit of vigour sente  
To hem, and saved hem out of meschance,  
So sente he might and vigour to Custance.

O foul desire of lechery, lo thine end!  
Not only dost thou cripple a man’s mind,  
But verily dost thou his body rend;  
The end of all thy work and thy lusts blind  
Is bitterness; how many may we find  
That not for actions but for mere intent  
To do this sin, to shame or death are sent.  

How could this poor weak woman have the strength  
To keep herself against that renegade?  

Goliath of immeasurable length,  
How could young David such a death have made,  
So slight and without armour? How arrayed  
Himself to look upon that dreadful face?  
Men may well see, it was but God’s own grace!  

Who gave to Judith courage all reckless  
To slay him, Holofernes, in his tent,  
And to deliver out of wretchedness  
The folk of God? I say, for this intent  
That just as God a soul of vigour sent  
To them, and saved them out of their mischance,  
So sent He might and vigour to Constance.

Forth went her ship and through the narrow mouth  
Of Ceuta and Gibraltar, on its way,

Sometimes to west, and sometimes north or south,  
Aye and sometimes east, many a weary day,  

Until Christ’s Mother (blessed be she ay!)  
Did destine, out of good that is endless,  
To make an end of Constance’ heaviness.

Somtyme west, somtyme north and south,  
And somtyme east, ful many a weary day,  
Til Cristes moder (blessed be she ay!)  
Hath shapen, through hir endless goodnesse,  
To make an ende of al hir hevinesse.

But let us leave this Constance now, and turn  
To speak of that same Roman emperor  
Who does, from Syria, by letters, learn  
The slaughter of Christians and the dishonour  
Done to his daughter by a vile traitor —  

I mean that old sultana, years ago,  
Who, at the feast, slew all men, high and low.  

For which this emperor did send anon  
A senator, with royal ordinance,  
And other lords, God knows, and many a one,  
On Syrians to take full high vengeance.  

They burn, they slay, they give them all mischance  
Through many a day; but, briefly to make end,  
Homeward to Rome, at last, the victors wend.

This senator returned with victory  
To Rome again, sailing right royally,  
And spied the ship (so goes the old story)  
In which our Constance sat so piteously,  
Nothing he knew of who she was, or why  
She was in such a plight; nor would she say  
Aught of herself, though she might die that day.

He took her into Rome, and to his wife  
Gave her in charge, and her young son also;  
And in his house she lived awhile her life.  

Thus can Our Lady bring from deepest woe  
Most woeful Constance, aye and more, we know.  
And for a long time dwelt she in that place,  
Engaged in God’s good works, such was her grace.

Now lat us stinte of Custance but a throwe,  
And spake we of the Romain Emperour,  
That out of Syrie hath by lettres knowe  
The slaughter of Cristen folk, and dishonour  
Don to his doghter by a fals traitour,  
I mene the cursed wikked sowdanesse,  
That at the feste leet sleen both more and lesse.  

For which this emperour hath sent anoon  
His senatour, with royal ordinance,  
And other lordes, God wot, many oon,  
On Surriens to taken heigh vengeance.  

They brennen, sleen, and bringe hem to meschance  
Ful many a day; but shortly, this is the ende,  
Homeward to Rome they shapen hem to wende.

This senatour repaireth with victorie  
To Rome-ward, sailling ful royally,  
And mette the ship dryving, as seith the storie,  
In which Custance sit ful pitously.  
No-thing ne knew he what she was, ne why  
She was in swich array; ne she nil seye  
Of hir estat, althogh she sholde deye.

He bringeth hir to Rome, and to his wife  
He yaf hir, and hir yonge sone also;  
And with the senatour she ladde her lyf.  

Thus can our lady bringen out of wo  
Woful Custance, and many another mo.  
And longe tyme dwelled she in that place,  
In holy werkes ever, as was hir grace.

The senator’s good wife her own aunt was,  
Yet for all that she knew her never the more;  
I will no longer tarry in this case,  
But to King Alla, whom we left, of yore,  
Weeping for his lost wife and sighing sore,  
I will return, and I will leave Constance  
Under the senator’s roof and governance.

King Alla, who had had his mother slain,  
Upon a day fell to such repentance,  
That, but to tell it briefly and be plain,  
To Rome he came to pay his just penance  
And put himself in the pope’s ordinance,  
In high and low; and Jesus Christ he sought  
To pardon all the wicked deeds he’d wrought.

The news anon through all Rome town was borne,  
How King Alla would come on pilgrimage,  
By harbingers that unto him were sworn;  
Whereat the senator, as was usage,  
Rode out to him, with many of his lineage,  
As well to show his own magnificence  
As to do to any king a reverence.

Great cheer did this noble senator  
To King Alla, and he to him also;  
Everich of hem doth other greet honour;  
And so befell that, in a day or two,  
This senator is to King Alla go  
To feste, and shortly, if I shall not lie,  
Constance’s son went in his company.

Some men would say, at request of Constance,  
This senator hath lad this child to feste;  
I may not tell every circumstance,  
Be as be may, there was he at the leste.  
But sooth is this, that, at his modres heste,  
Before Alla, during the metes space,  
The child stood, looking in the kinges face.

This Alla king hath of this child great wonder.  
And to the senator he seyde anon,  
“Whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?”  
“I know not,” quod he, “by God, and by Saint John!  
A moder he hath, but fader hath he non  
That I of woot” — but shortly, in a stounde,  
He tolde Alla how that this child was founde.

“But God wot,” quod this senatour also,  
“So vertuous a liver in my lyf,  
Ne saugh I never as she, ne herde of mo  
Of worldly wommen, mayden, nor of wyf;  
I dar wel seyn hir hadde lever a knyf  
Thurgh-out her breste, than been a womman wikke;  
Ther is no man coude bringe hir to that prikke.”

Now was this child lyk unto Constance  
As possible is a creature to be.  
This Alla hath the face in remembrance  
Of dame Custance, and ther-on mused he  
If that the childes moder were aught she  
That was his wyf, and privily he sighte,  
And spedde him fro the table that he mighte.

“Parfay,” thoghte he, “fantome is in myn heed!  
I oghte deme, of skilful jugement,  
That in the salte see my wyf is deed.”  

And afterward he made his argument —  
“What woot I, if that Crist have hider y-sent  
My wyf by see, as wel as he hir sente  
To my contree fro thennes that she wente?”  

And, after noon, home with the senator  
Goth Alla, for to see this wonder chaunce.  
This senator dooth Alla greet honour.  
And hastily he sente after Custance.

But trusteth weel, hir liste nat to daunce  
When that she wiste wherefor was that sonde.  
Unnethe upon hir feet she mighte stonde.

When Alla saugh his wyf, faire he hir grette,  
And weep, that it was routhe for to see.  
For at the firste look he on hir sette  
He knew wel verraily that it was she.  
And she for sorwe as domb stant as a tree;

So was her heart shut up in her distress  
When she remembered his unkindliness.

Twice did she swoon away there, in his sight;  
He wept and he protested piteously.  

“Now God,” quoth he, “and all His angels bright  
So truly on my spirit have mercy  
As of your ills all innocent am I,  
As is Maurice, my son, so like your face,  
Or may the foul Fiend take me from this place!”  

Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain  
Before their woeful hearts could find surcease;  
Great was the pity to hear them complain,  
Whereof their sorrows surely did increase.

I pray you all my labour to release;  
I cannot tell their grief until tomorrow,  
I am so weary, speaking long of sorrow.

But, truth being known and all doubt now dismissed,  
And Alla proven guiltless of her woe,  
I think a hundred times they must have kissed,  
And such great bliss there was between the two  
That, save the joy that nevermore shall go,  
There was naught like it, present time or past,  
Nor shall be, ever, while the world shall last.

Then prayed she of her husband, all meekly,  
As for her pain a splendid anodyne,  
That he would pray her father, specially,  
That, of his majesty, he would incline  
And that, some day, would come with him to dine;  
She prayed him, also, he should in no way  
Unto her father one word of her say.

Some men would say, it was the child Maurice  
Did bear this message to the emperor;  
But, as I guess, King Alla was too nice  
In etiquette to one of such honour  
As he that was of Christendom the flower,  
To send a child; and it is best to deem  
He went himself, and so it well may seem.

This emperor has granted, graciously,  
To come to dinner, as he’s been besought,  
And, well I think, he pondered busily  
Upon the child, and on his daughter thought.  

Alla went to his inn, and, as he ought,  
Made ready for the feast in every wise  
As far as his experience could devise.

The morrow came, and Alla rose to dress,  
And, too, his wife, the emperor to meet;  
And forth they rode in joy and happiness.

And when she saw her father in the street,  
She lighted down, and falling at his feet,  
“Father,” quoth she, “your young child, your Constance,  
Is now gone clean out of your remembrance.  

“I am your daughter Constance,” then said she,  
“That once you sent to Syria. ’Tis I.”

Twice she swooned in his own sight;  
He wept, and him excused piteously:

“Now God,” quod he, “and alle his halwes brighte,  
So wisely on my soule have mercy,  
That of your harm as guiltless am I  
As is Maurice my son, so lyk your face;  
Elies the feend me fecche out of this place!”  

Long was the sobbing and the bitter peyne  
Ere that their woeful hertes might cesse;  
Great was the pity to hear them pleyne,  
Through which complaints gan hir wo encresse.

I prey yow al my labour to relesse;  
I may nat telle hir wo until tomorwe,  
I am so wery for to speke of sorwe.

But finally, when that the sooth is wist  
That Alla gilteless was of hir wo,  
I trowe an hundred tymes been they kist,  
And swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two  
That, save the joye that lasteth evermo,  
Ther is non lyk, that any creature  
Hath seyn or shal, whyl that the world may dure.

Tho preyde she hir housbond mekely  
In relief of hir longe pitous pyne,  
That he wolde preye hir fader specially  
That, of his magestee, he wolde enclyne  
To vouche-sauf som day with him to dyne;  
She preyde him eek, he sholde by no weye  
Unto hir fader no word of hir seye.

Som men wold seyn, how that the child Maurice  
Doth this message unto this emperour;  
But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nyce  
To him, that was of so sovereyn honour  
As he that is of Cristen folk the flour,  
Sente any child, but it is bet to deme  
He wente him-self, and so it may wel seme.

This emperour hath graunted gentilly  
To come to diner, as he him bisoȝhte;  
And wel rede I, he loked bisily  
Up-on this child, and on his doghter thoghte.

Alla goth to his in, and, as him oghte,  
Arrayed for this feste in every wyse  
As ferforth as his conning may suffyse.

The morwe cam, and Alla gan him dresse,  
And eke his wyf, this emperour to mete;  
And forth they ryde in joye and in gladnesse.

And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete,  
She lighte doun, and falleth him to fete.  
“Fader,” quod she, “your yonge child Custance  
Is now ful dene out of your remembrance.

I am your doghter Custance,” quod she,  
“That whylom ye han sent unto Surrye.

It is I, father, who, on the salt sea,  
Was sent, alone to drift and doomed to die.

But now, good father, mercy must I cry:  
Send me namore unto non hethenesse,  
But thank my lord here of his kindeness.”

Who can the pitous joye tellen al  
Bitwix hem three, sin they ben thus y-mette?  
But of my tale make an ende I shal;  
The day goth faste, I wol no lenger lette.

These glad folk to diner they hem sette;  
In joye and blisse at mete I lete hem dwelle  
A thousand fold wel more than I can telle.

This child Maurice was sithen emperour  
Made by the pope, and lived Cristenly.  
To Cristes chirche he dide greet honour;  
But I lete al his storie passen by,  
Of Custance is my tale specially.

In olde Romayn gestes may men finde  
Maurices lyf; I bere it noght in minde.

This king Alla, whan he his tyme sey,  
With his Custance, his holy wyf so swete,  
To Engelond been they come the right wey,  
Wher-as they live in joye and in quiete.

But litel whyl it lasteth, I yow hete,  
Joye of this world, for tyme wol nat abyde;  
Fro day to night it changeth as the tyde.

Who lived ever in swich delyt o day  
That him ne moeved outher conscience,  
Or ire, or talent, or som kin affray,  
Envye, or pryde, or passion, or offence?

I ne seye but for this ende this sentence,  
That litel whyl in joye or in plesance  
Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custance.

For deeth, that taketh of heigh and low his rente,  
When passed was a yeer, even as I gesse,  
Out of this world this king Alla he hente.

For whom Custance hath ful gret hevinesse.  
Now lat us preyen God his soule blesse!

And dame Custance, fynally to seye,  
Towards the toun of Rome gooth hir weye.

To Rome is come this holy creature,  
And fyndeth ther hir frendes hole and sounder:  
Now is she scaped al hir aventure;  
And whan that she hir fader hath y-founde,  
Doun on hir knees falleth she to grounde;  
Weeping for tendrenesse in herte blythe.  

She herieth God an hundred thousand sythe.

In vertu and in holy almes-dede  
They liven alle, and never a-sonder wende;  
Til deeth departed hem, this lyf they lede.

And fareth now weel, my tale is at an ende.

Now Jesu Crist, that of his might may sende  
Joye after wo, governe us in his grace,  
And kepe us alle that ben in this place! Amen.

# The Wife of Bath’s Prologue

He is too niggardly who will not lend
A man to light his candle at his lantern;
He shall have never the less light, pardee;
Since you have enough, there’s no need to complain.

You say also that if we make ourselves gay
With clothing and with precious array,
That it is peril to our chastity;
And yet, with sorrow, you must force yourself,
And say these words in the apostle’s name:
“In habits meet for chastity and shame
Your women shall be arrayed,” said he,
“And not with braided hair and gay perry,
With pearls, nor with gold, nor costly clothes”;
After your text, and after your rubric,
I will not follow more than would a gnat.
You said this too, that I was like a cat;
For if one were to singe a cat’s furred skin,
Then the cat would well remain within the house;
And if the cat’s coat be all sleek and gay,

She will not dwell in house a half a day,
But out she’ll go, ere dawn of any day,
To show her skin and caterwaul and play.
This is to say: if I’m a little gay,
To show my rags I’ll gad about all day.

“Sir ancient fool, what ails you with your spies?
Though you pray Argus, with his hundred eyes,
To be my body-guard and do his best,
Faith, he shall not hold me, save I be modest;
I could delude him easily—trust me!
You said also that there are three things —
three —
Which things are a trouble on this earth,
And that no man may ever endure the fourth:
O dear sir rogue, may Christ cut short your life!
Yet do you preach and say a hateful wife
Is to be reckoned one of these mishances.
Are there no other kinds of resemblances
That you may liken thus your parables to,
But must a hapless wife be made to do?

“You liken woman’s love to very hell,
To barren land where waters do not dwell.
You liken it also unto wildfire;
The more it burns, the more it has desire
To consume everything that burned may be.
You say that just as worms destroy a tree,
Just so a wife destroys her own husband;
Men know this who are bound in marriage band.

“Masters, thus, as you must understand,
Did I my old men charge and censure, and
Claim that they said these things in drunkenness;
And all was false, but yet I took witness
Of Jenkin and of my dear niece also.
O Lord, the pain I gave them and the woe,
All guiltless too, by God’s sweet grievousness!
For like a stallion could I neigh and bite.
I could complain, though mine was all the guilt,
Or else, full many a time, I’d lost the tilt.
Whoso comes first to mill first gets the meal ground;
I whimpered first and so did them confound.
They were right glad to hasten to excuse
Things they had never done, save in my ruse.
‘With wenches would I charge him,’ by my hand,
When, for some illness, he could hardly stand.
Yet tickled this the heart of him, for he
Deemed that it was love produced such jealousy.
I swore that all my walking out at night
Was but to spy on girls he kept outright;
And under cover of that I had much mirth.
For all such wit is given us at birth;
Deceit, weeping, and spinning — God gives
To women, naturally, while they live.

And thus of one thing I speak boastfully:
I got the best of each one, finally,
By trick, or force, or by some kind of thing,
As by continual growls or murmuring;
Especially in bed had they mischance;
There would I chide and give them no pleasance;
I would no longer in the bed abide
If I but felt his arm across my side,
Till he had paid his ransom unto me;
Then would I let him do his nicety.

And therefore every man this tale I tell,
Win who-so may, for all is for to sell.
With empty hand men may no hawks lure;
For winning would I all his lust endure,
And make me a feigned appetite;
And yet in bacon had I never delight;
That made me ever to chide them so.
For though the pope had sat there at their side,
I would not spare them at their own board;
For by my troth, I quit them word for word.
As help me very God omnipotent,
Though I right now should make my testament,
I owe them not a word that it is not quit;
I brought it so about by my wit
That they must give it up, as for the best;
Or else we had never been in rest.
For though he looked like a wood lion,
Yet should he fail of his conclusion.
Then would I say, ‘Good lief, take heed:
How meekly looks Wilkin, our poor sheep;
Come near, my spouse, let me kiss your cheek!
You should be all patient and meek,
And have a sweet, scrupulous conscience,
Since you so preach of Job’s patience.
Suffer always, since you so well can preach;
And but you do, certainly we shall teach
That it is fair to have a wife in peace.
One of us two must bow, doubtless;
And since a man is more reasonable
Than woman is, ye must be sufferable.
What aileth you to grudge thus and groan?
Is it because you would have my queynte alone?
Why take it all? Lo, have it every-deel;
Peter! I beshrew you but you love it well!
For if I would sell my belle chose,
I could walk forth as fresh as is a rose;
But I will keep it for your own sweet tooth.
You are to blame, by God, I say you sooth.’

Such manner words had we on hand.
Now will I speak of my fourth husband.

My fourth husband was a revelour;
That is to say, he had a paramour;
And I was young and full of ragerye,
Stubborn and strong and jolly as a pie.
Well could I dance to a small harp,
And sing, by God, as any nightingale
When I had drunk a draught of sweet wine.
Metellius, the foul churl, the swine,
That with a staff bereft his wife of life,
Because she drank wine — had I been his wife,
He should not have daunted me from drink;
And after wine, on Venus most must I think:
For as surely as cold engenders hail,
A licorous mouth must have a licorous tail.
In women vinolence is no defence —
This know lechers by experience.

But Lord Christ! when that it remembereth me
Upon my youth and on my jollity,
It tickles me about my heart’s deep root.
To this day it does my heart some good
That I have had my world in my time.
But age, alas! that all will envenom,
Has taken away my beauty and my pith;
Let go, farewell, the devil go with it!
The flour is gone, there is no more to tell;
The bran, as best I may, must now I sell;
But yet to be right merry I’ll try and strive.

I say that in my heart I had great despite
When he of any other had delight.
But he was quit, by God and by Saint Jooce!
I made, of the same wood, a staff most gross;
Not with my body, nor in manner foul,
But certainly I showed so gay a soul
That in his own thick grease I made him fry
For anger and for utter jealousy.
By God, on earth I was his purgatory,
For which I hope his soul lives now in glory.
For God knows many a time he sat and sung
When the shoe bitterly his foot had wrung;
There was no one, save God and he, that knew
How low, in so many ways, I’d twist the screw.
He died when I came from Jerusalem,
And lies entombed beneath the great rood beam;
Although his tomb is not so glorious
As was the sepulchre of Darius,
Which Appelles wrought full subtly;
'Twas waste to bury him expensively.
Let him fare well; God give his soul good rest:
He now is in the grave and in his chest.

And now of my fifth husband will I tell;
God grant his soul may never come to Hell!
And yet he was to me the most brutal too;
My ribs yet feel as though they were black and blue,
And ever shall, until my dying day.
But in our bed he was so fresh and gay,
And therewithal he could so well impose
When that he wanted use of my belle chose,
That though he’d beaten me on every bone,
I could re-win my love, and that full soon.
I think I loved him best of all, for he
Gave of his love most sparingly to me.
We women have, if I shall not lie,
In this love matter a quaint fantasy:
We want a thing we may not lightly have,
And after that we’ll cry and crave all day.
Forbid a thing, and that thing covet we;
Press hard upon us, then we turn and flee.
Sparingly we offer up our goods when fair;
Great crowds at market make for dearer ware,
And what’s too common brings but little price;
All this knows every woman who is wise.

My fifth husband, God his spirit bless!
Whom I took all for love, and not for riches,
Had once been sometime a student at Oxford,
And had left school and come home to board
With my best gossip, dwelling in our town —
God save her soul! Her name was Alison.
She knew my heart and all my privity
Better than did our parish priest, so help me!
To her confided I my secrets all.
For had my husband pissed against a wall,
Or done a thing that might have cost his life,
To her and to another worthy wife,
And to my niece, whom I loved well always,
I would have told his counsel every-deel.
And so I did full often, God it wot;
Which made his face full often red and hot
For very shame; he blamed himself that he
Had told to me so great a privity.
So it befell that once, in Lent (for oft
I to my gossip went), because I loved
To be gay, and for to walk in March and May,
From house to house, to hear sundry tales,
That Jenkin the clerk, and my gossip Dame Alis,
And I myself, into the fields went.
My husband was at London all that Lent,
I had the better leisure then to play,
And for to see, and also to be seen
Of lusty folk; what wist I where my grace
Was shaped for to be, or in what place?
Therefore I made my visitations,
To vigils and to processions,
To preaching eke, and to these pilgrimages,
To plays of miracles and marriages,
And wore upon my gay scarlet garments.
These worms, nor moths, nor mites upon my peril
Fretted them never a deal; and know you why?
For they were used well, and so I rode.

Now will I tell forth what happened me.
I say that in the fields we walked till we three
Had such dalliance—this clerk and I—
That of my purveyance I spake to him,
And said how that if I were widow, he
Should wed me. For certainly, I say,
I was never without purveyance
Of marriage, nor of other things also.
I hold a mouse’s heart not worth a leek
That hath but one hole for to start unto,
And if that fail, then all is y-do.
I made him think he had enchanted me;
My dame taught me that subtlety.
And eke I said I met of him all night;
He would have slain me as I lay upright,
And all my bed was full of very blood;
But yet I hoped that he would do me good,
For blood betokeneth gold, as I was taught.
And all was false; I dreamed of it naught,
But as I followed ever my dame’s lore,
As well of this as of other things more.

But now, sir, let me see what I shall say?
Ah! By God, I have my tale again.
When that my fourth husband lay upon his bier,
I wept enough and made sorry cheer,
As wives must do, for that is usage,
And with my coverchief covered up my visage;
But for that I was purveyed of a make,
I wept but small, and that I undertake.
To church my husband was borne a-morrow
With neighbors that for him made signs of sorrow;
And Jenkin our clerk was one of those.
As help me God, when that I saw him go
After the bier, me thought he had a pair
Of legs and of feet so clean and fair
That all my heart I gave unto his hold.
He was, I think, but twenty winters old,
And I was forty, if I tell the truth;
But then I always had a young colt’s tooth.
Gap-toothed I was, and that became me well;
I had the print of holy Venus’ seal.
So help me God, I was a healthy one,
And fair and rich and young and full of fun;
And truly, as my husbands all told me,
I had the silkiest quoniam that could be.
For truly I am all Venusian in feeling,
And my brain is Mars’s also revealing.
Venus gave me my lust, my lickerishness,
And Mars gave me my sturdy hardiness.
Taurus was my ascendant, with Mars therein.
Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!
I followed always my own inclination
By virtue of my natal constellation;
Which wrought me so I never could withdraw
My Venus-chamber from a good fellow.
Yet have I Mars’s mark upon my face,
And also in another private place.
For God so truly my salvation be,
As I have never loved for policy,
But ever followed my own appetite,
Though he were short or tall or black or white;
I took no heed, so that he cared for me,
How poor he was nor even of what degree.

What should I say now, save that at the month’s end
This jolly, gentle Jenkin, my dear friend,
Had wedded me full ceremoniously,
And to him gave I all the land in fee
That ever had been given me before;
But afterward I repented me full sore.
He never suffered me to have my way.
By God, he smote me on the ear one day
Because I tore out of his book a leaf,
So that from this my ear is grown deaf.
Stubborn I was as is a lioness,
And with my tongue a very jay, I guess;
And walk I would, as I had done before,
From house to house, though I should not, he swore.
For which he oftentimes would sit and preach
And read old Roman tales to me and teach
How Sulpicius Gallus left his wife
And her forsook for term of all his life,
Because he saw her with a bared head,
Looking out from his door upon a day.

Another Roman told he of by name
Who, since his wife was at a summer game
Without his knowing, he forsook her eke.
And then would he within his Bible seek
That proverb of the old Ecclesiast...

## THE WIFE OF BATH'S PROLOGUE

Where he commands so freely and so fast  
That man forbid his wife to gad about;  

Then would he thus repeat, with never doubt;  
‘Whoso would build his whole house out of sallows,  
And spur his blind horse to run over fallows,  
And let his wife alone go seeking hallows,  
Is worthy to be hanged upon the gallows.’

But all for naught, I didn’t care a haw.

That al myn herte I yaf unto his hold.  
He was, I trowe, a twenty winter old,  
And I was fourty, if I shai scye sooth;  
But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.  
Gat-tooth I was, and that bicam me weel;  
I hadde the prente of seynt Venus seel.  
As help me God, I was a lusty oon,  
And faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon;  
And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me,  
I had the beste quoniam mighte be.  

For certes, I am al Venerien  
In felinge, and myn herte is Marcien.  
Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse,  
And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse.  
Myn ascendent was Taur, and Mars therinne.  
Allas! allas! that ever love was sinne!  

I folwed ay myn inclinacioun  
By vertu of my constellacioun;  
That made me I coude noght withdrawe  
My chambre of Venus from a good felawe.  
Yet have I Martes mark upon my face,  
And also in another privee place.  
For, God so wis be my savacioun,  
I ne loved never by no discrecioun.  
But ever folwede myn appetyt,  
Al were he short or long, or blak or whyt;  
I took no kepe, so that he lyked me,  
How pore he was, ne eek of what degree.  

What sholde I seye, but, at the monthes ende,  
This joly clerk Jankin, that was so hende,  
Hath wedded me with greet solempnitee,  
And to him yaf I al the lond and fee  
That ever was me yeven ther-bifore;  
But afterward repented me ful sore.  
He nolde suffre nothing of my list.  
By God, he smoot me ones on the list,  
For that I rente out of his book a leef.  
That of the strook myn ere wex al deef.  
Stibom I was as is a leonesse,  
And of my tonge a verray jangleresse.  
And walke I wolde, as I hadde doon biforn,  
From hous to hous, al-though he hadde it sworn.  
For which he often tymes wolde preche,  
And me of olde Romayn gestes teche.  
How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wyf,  
And hir forsook for terme of al his lyf,  
Noght but for open-heeded he hir say  
Lokinge out at his dore upon a day.  
Another Romayne tolde he me by name.  
That, for his wyf was at a someres game  
With-oute his witing, he forsook hir eke.  
And than wolde he upon his Bible seke  
That ilke proverbe of Ecclesiaste,  
Wher he comandeth and forbeedeth faste  
Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute;  

> Than wolde he seye right thus, withouten doute,  
> “Who-so that buildeth his hous al of sallwes,  
> And priketh his blinde hors over the falwes,  
> And suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes,  
> Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!”

But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe  
Of his proverbes ne of his olde sawe,  
Ne I wolde nat of him corrected be.  
I hate him that my vices telleth me,  
And so do mo, God woot! of us than I.  
This made him with me wood al outrely;  
I nolde noght forbere him in no cas.  

Now wol I seye yow sooth by seint Thomas,  
Why that I rente out of his book a leef.  
For which he smoot me so that I was deef.  
He hadde a book that gladly, night and day,  
For his desport he wolde rede alway.  
He cleped it Valerius and Theophraste,  
At which book he lough alwey ful faste.  
And eek ther was som-tyme a clerk at Rome,  
A cardinal, that highte Seint Jerome,  
That made a book agayn Jovinian;  
In which book eek ther was Tertulan,  
Crisippus, Trotula, and Heloyse,  
That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys;  
And eek the Parables of Salomon,  
Ovides Art, and bokes many on,  
And alle thise wer bounden in o volume.  
And every night and day was his custume,  
Whan he hadde leyser and vacacioun  
From other worldly occupacioun,  
To reden on this book of wikked wyves.  
He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves  
Than been of gode wyves in the Bible.  

For trusteth wel, it is an impossible  
That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,  
But if it be of holy seintes lyves,  
Ne of noon other womman never the mo.  
Who peyntede the leoun, tel me who?  
By God, if wommen hadde writen stories,  
As clerkes han withinne hir oratories,  
They wolde han writen of men more wikkednesse  
Than all the mark of Adam may redresse.  

The children of Mercurie and of Venus  
Been in hir wirking ful contrarious;  
Mercurie loveth wisdom and science,  
And Venus loveth ryot and dispence.  
And, for hir diverse disposicioun,  
Ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun;  
And thus, God woot! Mercurie is desolat  
In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat;  
And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reysed;  
Therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed.  

The clerk, whan he is old, and may noght do  
Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho,  
Than sit he doun, and write in his dotage  
That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage!  

But now to purpos, why I tolde thee  
That I was beten for a book, pardee.  
Upon a night Jankin, that was our syre,  
Redde on his book, as he sat by the fyre,  
Of Eva first, that, for hir wikkednesse,  
Was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse,  
For which that Jesu Crist himself was slayn,  
That boghte us with his herte-blood agayn.  
Lo, here expres of womman may ye finde,  
That womman was the los of al mankinde.

Then read he how Samson lost his heres,  
Sleeping, his leman kitte hem with hir sheres;  
Through which tresoun loste he bothe his yeen.  

Then read he me, if that I shal nat lyen,  
Of Hercules and of his Deianira,  
That caused him to sette himself a-fyre.  
Nothing forgat he of the penaunce and wo  
That Socrates had with his wyves two;  
How Xantippe caste pisse upon his heed;  
This sely man sat stille, as he were deed;  
He wiped his heed, namore dorste he seyn  
But “Er that thonder stinte, comth a reyn.”  

Of Pasiphae, that was the quene of Crete,  
For shrewednesse, him thought the tale swete;  
Fy! spek na-more — it is a grisly thing —  
Of hir horrible lust and hir lyking.  

Of Clytemnestra, for hir lecherye,  
That falsly made hir housbond for to dye,  
He redde it with ful good devocioun.  
He tolde me eek for what occasioun  
Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lyf;  
Myn housbond hadde a legende of his wyf,  
Eriphilem, that for an ouche of gold  
Hath prively unto the Grekes told  
Wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place.  
For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace.  

Of Lyma tolde he me, and of Lucye,  
They bothe made hir housbondes for to dye;  
That oon for love, that other was for hate;  
Lyma hir housbond, on an even late,  
Empoysoned hath, for that she was his fo.  
Lucya, likerous, loved hir housbond so  
That, for he sholde alwey upon hir thinke,  
She yaf him swich a maner love-drinke,  
That he was deed, er it were by the morwe;  
And thus algates housbondes han sorwe.  

Than tolde he me, how oon Latumius  
Compleyned to his felawe Arrius,  
That in his gardin growed swich a tree,  
On which, he seyde, how that his wyves three  
Hanged hem-self for herte despitous.  
“O leve brother,” quod this Arrius,  
“Yif me a plante of thilke blessed tree,  
And in my gardin planted shal it be!”  

Of later date, of wyves hath he red,  
That somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed,  
And lete hir lechour dighte hir al the night  
Whyl that the corps lay in the floor up-right.  
And somme han drive nayles in hir brayn  
Whyl that they slepte, and thus they han hem slayn.  
Somme han hem yeve poysoun in hir drinke.  
He spak more harm than herte may bithinke.  

And ther-with-al, he knew of mo proverbes  
Than in this world ther growen gras or herbes.  
“Bet is,” quod he, “thyn habitacioun  
Be with a leoun or a foul dragoun,  
Than with a womman usinge for to chyde.  
Bet is,” quod he, “hye in the roof abyde  
Than with an angry wyf doun in the hous;  
They been so wikked and contrarious;  
They haten that hir housbondes loveth ay.  
He seyde, ‘a womman cast hir shame away

Whan she cast of hir smock; and furthermo,  
‘A fair womman, but she be chaste also,  
Is lyk a gold ring in a sowes nose.’

Who woulde wene, or who woulde suppose  
The wo that in myn herte was, and pyne?  
And whan I saugh he wolde never fyne  
To reden on this cursed book al nyght,  
Al sodeynly three leves have I plight  
Out of his book, right as he radde, and eke  
I with my fist so toke him on the cheke,  
That in our fyr he fil bakward adoun.  
And he up-stirte as dooth a wood leoun,  
And with his fist he smoot me on the heed,  
That in the floor I lay as I were deed.  

And when he saugh how stifle that I lay,  
He was agast, and wolde han fled his way.  
Til atte laste out of my swogh I breyde:  
“O! hastow slayn me, false theef?” I seyde,  
“And for my land thus hastow mordred me?  
Er I be deed, yet wol I kisse thee.”  

And neer he cam, and kneled faire adoun,  
And seyde, “Dere suster Alisoun,  
As help me God, I shal thee never smyte;  
That I have doon, it is thy-self to wyte.  
Foryeve it me, and that I thee biseke.”  

And yet eft-sones I hitte him on the cheke,  
And seyde, “Theef, thus muchel am I wreke;  
Now wol I dye, I may ne lenger speke.”  

But atte laste, with muchel care and wo,  
We fille acorded, by us selven two.  
He yaf me al the brydel in myn hond  
To han the governance of hous and lond,  
And of his tonge and of his hond also,  
And made him brenne his book anon right tho.  
And whan that I hadde geten unto me,  
By maistrie, al the soveraynetee,  
And that he seyde, “Myn owene trewe wyf,  
Do as thee lust the terme of al thy lyf,  
Keep thyn honour, and keep eek myn estaat” —  
After that day we hadden never debaat.  

God help me so, I was to him as kinde  
As any wyf from Denmark unto Inde,  
And also trewe, and so was he to me.  
I prey to God that sit in magestee,  
So blesse his soule, for his mercy dere!  
Now wol I seye my tale, if ye wol here.

---

The friar laughed, whan he hadde herd al this,  
“Now, dame,” quod he, “so have I joye or blis,  
This is a long preamble of a tale!”  

And whan the Somnour herde the Frere gale,  
“Lo!” quod the Somnour, “Goddes armes two!  
A frere wol entremette him ever-mo.  
Lo, gode men, a flye and eek a frere  
Wol falle in every dish and eek matere.  
What spekestow of preambulacioun?  
What! amble, or trotte, or pees, or go sit doun;  
Thou lettest our disport in this manere.”  

“Ye, wol tow so, sir Somnour?” quod the Frere,  
“Now, by my feith, I shal, er that I go,  
Telle of a Somnour swich a tale or two,  
That alle the folk shal laughen in this place.”

“Otherwise, frere, I beshrew thy face,”  
Replied this Somnour, “and I beshrew me  
If I do not tell tales here, two or three,  
Of freres ere I come to Sittingbourne,  
That certainly will give you cause to mourn.  
For wel I wot thy patience is goon.”  

Our hoste cryde, “Pees! and that anoon!”  
And seyde, “Lat the womman telle hir tale.  
Ye fare as folk that dronken been of ale.  
Do, dame, tel forth your tale, and that is best.”  

“Al redy, sir,” quod she, “right as yow lest,  
If I have licence of this worthy Frere.”  

“Yis, dame,” quod he, “tel forth, and I wol here.”

### HERE ENDETH THE WIFE OF BATH HER PROLOGUE

## THE TALE OF THE WIFE OF BATH

### HERE BEGINNETH THE TALE OF THE WIFE OF BATH

Now in the olden dayes of King Arthur,  
Of whom the Britons speken greet honour,  
Al was this land ful-fild of fayerye.  
The elf-queen, with hir joly companye,  
Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede;  
This was the olde opinion, as I rede.  
I speke of manye hundred yeres ago;  
But now can no man see none elves mo.  

For now the grete charitee and prayeres  
Of limitours and othere holy freres,  
That serchen every lond and every streem,  
As thikke as motes in the sonne-beem,  
Blessinge halles, chambres, kichenes, boures,  
Citees, burghes, castels, hye toures,  
Thropes, bemes, shipnes, dayeryes.  
This maketh that ther been no fayeryes.  

For ther as wont to walken was an elf,  
Ther walketh now the limitour himself  
In undermeles and in morweninges,  
And seyth his matins and his holy thinges  
As he goth in his limitacioun.  
Wommen may go saufly up and doun,  
In every bush, or under every tree;  
Ther is noon other incubus but he,  
And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour.  

And so bifel it, that this king Arthour  
Hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler,  
That on a day cam ryding fro river;  
And happed that, allone as she was born,  
He saugh a mayde walkinge him biforn;  
Of which mayde anon, maugree hir heed,  
By verray force he refte hir maydenheed,  
For which oppressioun was swich clamour  
And swich pursute unto the king Arthour,  
That dampned was this knight for to be deed  
By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed  
Paraventure, swich was the statut tho;  
(waterfowl beside a stream or mere.)

But that the quene and othere ladies mo  
So longe preyeden the king of grace,  
Til he his lif him graunted in the place,  
And yaf him to the quene al at hir wille,  
To chese, whether she wolde him save or spille.  
The quene thanketh the king with al hir might,  
And after this thus spak she to the knight,  
Whan that she saugh hir tyme, upon a day:  

“Thou standest yet,” quod she, “in swich array,  
That of thy lif yet hastow no suretee.  
I grante thee lif, if thou canst tellen me  
What thing is it that wommen most desyren.  
Be war, and keep thy nekke-boon from yren.  
And if thou canst nat tellen it anon,  
Yet wol I yeve thee leve for to gon  
A twelf-month and a day, to seche and lere  
An answere suffisant in this matere.  
And suretee wol I han, er that thou pace,  
Thy body for to yelden in this place.”  

Wo was this knight and lothly he syketh;  
But what! he may nat do al as him lyketh.  
And at the laste, he chees him for to wende,  
And come agayn, right at the yeres ende,  
With swich answere as God wolde him purvey;  
And taketh his leve, and wendeth forth his weye.  

He seketh every hous and every place,  
Wher-as he hopeth for to finde grace,  
To lerne what thing wommen loven most;  
But he ne coude arryven in no cost,  
Wher-as he mighte finde in this matere  
Two creatures accordinge in-fere.  

Somme seyde, wommen loven best richesse,  
Somme seyde, honour, somme seyde jolynesse;  
Somme, riche array, somme seyden, lust abedde,  
And ofte tyme to be widwe and wedde.  

Somme seyde, that our hertes been most esed  
Whan that we been y-flatered any y-plesed.  
He gooth ful ny the sothe, I wol nat lye;  
A man shal winne us best with flaterye;  
And with attendance, and with bisinesse,  
Been we y-lymed, bothe more and lesse.  

And somme seyn, that greet delyt han we  
For to ben holden stable and eek secree,  
And in o purpos stedefastly to dwelle,  
And nat biwreye thing that men us telle.  
But that tale is nat worth a rake-stele;  
Pardee, we wommen conne no-thing hele;  
Witnesse on Myda; wol ye here the tale?  
Ovyde, amonges othere thinges smale.

Some said that women love best riches,  
Some said, fair fame, and some, prettiness;  
Some, rich array, some said 'twas lust abed,  
And often to be widowed and re-wed.  

Some said that our poor hearts are aye most eased  
When we have been most flattered and thus pleased.  
He went nigh the truth, I will not lie;  
A man shall win us best with flattery;  

And with attendance, and with business,  
We are enticed, both more and less.  

And some say that great delight we have  
To be esteemed stable and also secret,  
To dwell steadfast in one purpose,  
And not to reveal things that men us tell.  
But that tale is not worth a rake-shaft;  
Pardee, we women can no thing heal;  
Witness on Midas; will ye hear the tale?  
Ovid, among other little things.

# THE TALE OF THE WIFE OF BATH

And with attentions and with busyness  
We’re often limed, the greater and the less.

And some say, too, that we do love the best  
To be quite free to do our own behest,  
And that no man reprove us for our vice,  
But saying we are wise, take our advice.

For truly there is no one of us all,  
If anyone shall rub us on a gall,  
That will not kick because he tells the truth.  
Try, and he’ll find who does so, I say sooth.

No matter how much vice we have within,  
We would be held for wise and clean of sin.  
And some folk say that great delight have we  
To be held constant, also trustworthy,  
And on one purpose steadfastly to dwell,  
And not betray a thing that men may tell.

But that tale is not worth a rake’s handle;  
By God, we women can no thing conceal.  
As witness Midas. Would you hear the tale?  
Ovid, among some other matters small,

Said Midas had beneath his long curled hair  
Two ass’s ears that grew in secret there,  
The which defect he hid, as best he might,  
Full cunningly from every person’s sight,  
And, save his wife, no one knew of it, no.  
He loved her most, and trusted her also;  
And he prayed of her that to no creature  
She’d tell of his disfigurement impure.

She swore him: “Nay, for all this world to win  
She would do no such villainy or sin  
And cause her husband have so foul a name;  
Nor would she tell it for her own deep shame.”  
Nevertheless, she thought she would have died  
Because so long the secret must she hide;  
It seemed to swell so big about her heart  
That some word from her mouth must surely start;  
And since she dared to tell it to no man,  
Down to a marsh, that lay hard by, she ran;  
Till she came there her heart was all afire,  
And as a bittern booms in the quagmire,  
She laid her mouth low to the water down:
“Betray me not, you sounding water blown,”  
Said she, “I tell it to none else but you:  
Long ears like asses’ has my husband two!  
Now is my heart at ease, since that is out;  
I could no longer keep it, there’s no doubt.”

Here may you see, though for a while we bide,  
Yet out it must; no secret can we hide.  
The rest of all this tale, if you would hear,  
Read Ovid: in his book does it appear.

This knight my tale is chiefly told about  
When what he went for he could not find out,  
That is, the thing that women love the best;  
Most saddened was the spirit in his breast;  
But home he goes, he could no more delay.  
The day was come when home he turned his way;  
And on his way it chanced that he should ride  
In all his care, beneath a forest’s side,  
And there he saw, a-dancing him before,  
Full four and twenty ladies, maybe more;  
Toward which dance eagerly did he turn  
In hope that there some wisdom he should learn.  
But truly, ere he came upon them there,  
The dancers vanished all, he knew not where.  
No creature saw he that gave sign of life,  
Save, on the greensward sitting, an old wife;  
A fouler person could no man devise.

Before the knight this old wife did arise,  
And said: “Sir knight, hence lies no travelled way.  
Tell me what thing you seek, and by your fay,  
Perchance you’ll find it may the better be;  
These ancient folk know many things,” said she.

“Dear mother,” said this knight assuredly,  
“I am but dead, save I can tell, truly,  
What thing it is that women most desire;  
Could you inform me, I’d pay well your hire.”  
“Plight me your troth here, hand in hand,” said she,  
“That you will do, whatever it may be,  
The thing I ask if it lie in your might;  
And I’ll give you your answer ere the night.”

### Middle English (lines 6535–6594)

Seyde, Myda hadde, under his longe hercs,  
Growing up-on his heed two asses eres,  
The whiche vyce he hidde, as he best mighte,  
Ful subtilly from every mannes sighte,  
That, save his wyf, ther wiste of it na-mo.  
He loved hir most, and trusted hir also;  
He preyede hir, that to no creature  
She sholde tellen of his disfigure.  

She swoor him “nay, for al this world to winne,  
She nolde do that vileinye or sinne,  
To make hir housbond han so foul a name;  
She nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame.”  

But nathelces, hir thoughte that she dyde,  
That she so longe sholde a conseil hyde;  
Hir thoughte it swal so sore aboute hir herte,  
That nedely som word hir moste asterte;  
And sith she dorste telle it to no man,  
Doun to a mareys faste by she ran;  
Til she came there, hir herte was a-fyre,  
And, as a bitore bombleth in the myre,  
She leyde hir mouth un-to the water doun:  
“Biwreye me nat, thou water, with thy soun,”  
Quod she, “to thee I telle it, and namo;  
Myn housbond hath longe asses eres two!  
Now is myn herte all hool, now is it oute;  
I mighte no lenger kepe it, out of doute.”  

Heer may ye se, thogh we a tyme abyde,  
Yet out it moot, we can no conseil hyde;  
The remenant of the tale if ye wol here,  
Redeth Ovyde, and ther ye may it lere.

This knight, of which my tale is specially,  
Whan that he saugh he mighte nat come therby,  
This is to seye, what wommen loven moost,  
With-inne his brest ful sorweful was the goost;  
But hoom he gooth, he mighte nat sojourne.  

The day was come, that hoomward moste he tourne,  
And in his wey it happed him to ryde,  
In al this care, under a forest-syde,  
Wher-as he saugh up-on a daunce go  
Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo;  
Toward the whiche daunce he drow ful yerne,  
In hope that som wisdom sholde he leme.  
But certeinly, er he came fully there,  
Vanisshed was this daunce, he niste where.  
No creature saugh he that bar lyf,  
Save on the grene he saugh sittinge a wyf;  
A fouler wight ther may no man devyse.  

Agayn the knight this olde wyf gan ryse,  
And seyde, “sir knight, heer-forth ne lyth no wey.  
Tel me, what that ye seken, by your fey?  
Paraventure it may the bettre be;  
Thise olde folk can muchel thing,” quod she.

“My leve mooder,” quod this knight certyen,  
“I nam but deed, but-if that I can seyn  
What thing it is that wommen most desyre;  
Coude ye me wissc, I wolde wel quyte your hyre.”  
“Plight me thy trouth, heer in myn hand,” quod she,  
“The nexte thing that I requere thee,  
Thou shalt it do, if it lye in thy might;  
And I wol telle it yow er it be night.”

---

“Have here my trouthe,” quod the knight, “I grante.”  
“Thanne,” quod she, “I dar me wel avante.  
Thy lyf is sauf, for I wol stonde therby,  
Up-on my lyf, the queen wol seye as I.  
Lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle  
That wereth on a coverchief or a caul,  
That dar seye nay, of that I shal thee teche;  
Lat us go forth with-outen lenger speche.”

Tho rouned she a pistel in his ere,  
And bad him to be glad, and have no fere.

Whan they be comen to the court, this knight  
Seyde, “he had holde his day, as he hadde hight.  
And redy was his answere,” as he sayde.

Full many a noble wyf, and many a mayde,  
And many a widwe, for that they ben wyse,  
The quene hir-self sittinge as a justyse,  
Assembled been, his answere for to here;  
And afterward this knight was bode appere.  

To every wight comanded was silence,  
And that the knight sholde telle in audience  
What thing that worldly wommen loven best.  
This knight ne stood nat stille as doth a best.  
But to his questioun anon answerde  
With manly voys, that al the court it herde:  

“My lige lady, generally,” quod he,  
“Wommen desyren to have sovereyntee  
As wel over hir housbond as hir love,  
And for to been in maistrie him above;  
This is your moste desyr, thogh ye me kille.  
Doth as yow list, I am heer at your wille.”

In al the court ne was ther wyf ne mayde,  
Ne widwe, that contraried that he sayde,  
But seyden, “he was worthy han his lyf.”  
And with that word up stirte the olde wyf,  
Which that the knight saugh sittinge in the grene:  
“Mercy,” quod she, “my sovereyn lady quene!

Er that your court departe, do me right.  
I taught this answere un-to the knight;  
For which he plighte me his trouthe there.  
The firste thing I wolde of him requere,  
He wolde it do, if it lay in his might.  
Bifore the court than preye I thee, sir knight,” quod she,  
“That thou me take un-to thy wyf;  
For wel thou wost that I have kept thy lyf.  
If I sey fals, sey nay, up-on thy fey!”

This knight answerde, “Alas! and weylawey!  
I woot right wel that swich was my biheste.  
For goddes love, as chees a newe requeste;  
Tak al my good, and lat my body go.”

“Nay than,” quod she, “I shrewe us bothe two!  
For thogh that I be foul, and old, and pore,  
I nolde for al the metal, ne for ore,  
That under erthe is grave, or lyth above,  
But-if thy wyf I were, and eek thy love.”

“My love?” quod he; “nay, my damnacioun!  
Allas! that any of my nacioun  
Sholde ever so foule disparaged be!”

But al for noght, the ende is this, that he  
Constreyned was, he nedes moste hir wedde;  
And taketh his olde wyf, and gooth to bedde.

### Middle English (lines 6595–6654)

“Have heer my trouthe,” quod the knight, “I grante.”  
“Thanne,” quod she, “I dar me wel avante.  
Thy lyf is sauf; and I wol stonde therby,  
Up-on my lyf, the queen wol seye as I.  
Lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle  
That wereth on a coverchief or a caul,  
That dar seye nay, of that I shal thee teche;  
Lat us go forth with-outen lenger speche.”  

Ihen whispered she a sentence in his ear,  
And bade him to be glad and have no fear.

When they were come unto the court, this knight  
Said he had kept his promise as was right,  
And ready was his answer, as he said.

Full many a noble wife, and many a maid,  
And many a widow, since they are so wise,  
The queen herself sitting as high justice,  
Assembled were, his answer there to hear;  
And then the knight was bidden to appear.

Command was given for silence in the hall,  
And that the knight should tell before them all  
What thing all worldly women love the best.  
This knight did not stand dumb, as does a beast,  
But to this question presently answered  
With manly voice, so that the whole court heard:

“My liege lady, generally,” said he,  
“Women desire to have the sovereignty  
As well upon their husband as their love,  
And to have mastery their man above;  
This thing you most desire, though me you kill.  
Do as you please, I am here at your will.”

In all the court there was no wife or maid  
Or widow that denied the thing he said,  
But all held, he was worthy to have life.

And with that word up started the old wife  
Whom he had seen a-sitting on the green.

“Mercy,” cried she, “my sovereign lady queen!  
Before the court’s dismissed, give me my right.  
’Twas I who taught the answer to this knight;  
For which he did plight troth to me, out there,  
That the first thing I should of him require  
He would do that, if it lay in his might.

Before the court, now, pray I you, sir knight,” said she,  
“That you will take me for your wife;  
For well you know that I have saved your life.  
If this be false, say nay, upon your fay!”

This knight replied: “Alas and welaway!  
That I so promised I will not protest.  
But for God’s love pray make a new request,  
Take all my wealth and let my body go.”

“Nay then,” said she, “beshrew us if I do!  
For though I may be foul and old and poor,  
I will not, for all metal and all ore  
That from the earth is dug or lies above,  
Be aught except your wife and your true love.”

“My love?” cried he, “nay, rather my damnation!  
Alas! that any of my race and station  
Should ever so dishonoured foully be!”

But all for naught; the end was this, that he  
Was so constrained he needs must go and wed,  
And take his ancient wife and go to bed.

---

Now, peradventure, would some men say here,  
That, of my negligence, I take no care  
To tell you of the joy and all the array  
That at the wedding feast were seen that day.

Make a brief answer to this thing I shall;  
I say, there was no joy or feast at all;  
There was but heaviness and grievous sorrow;  
For privately he wedded on the morrow,  
And all day then he hid him like an owl;  
So sad he was, his old wife looked so foul.  
Great was the woe the knight had in his thought  
When he, with her, to marriage bed was brought;  
He rolled about and turned him to and fro.

His old wife lay there, always smiling so,  
And said: “O my dear husband, benedicite!  
Fareth every knight with wife as you with me?  
Is this the custom in King Arthur’s house?  
Are knights of his all so fastidious?  
I am your own true love and, more, your wife;  
And I am she who saved your very life;  
And truly, since I’ve never done you wrong,  
Why do you treat me so this first night long?  
You act as does a man who’s lost his wit;  
What is my fault? For God’s love tell me it,  
And it shall be amended, if I may.”

“Amended!” cried this knight, “Alas, nay, nay!  
It will not be amended ever, no!  
You are so loathsome, and so old also,  
And therewith of so low a race were born,  
It’s little wonder that I toss and turn.  
Would God my heart would break within my breast!”

“Is this,” asked she, “the cause of your unrest?”  
“Yes, truly,” said he, “and no wonder ’tis.”  
“Now, sir,” said she, “I could amend all this,  
If I but would, and that within days three,  
If you would bear yourself well towards me.

“But since you speak of such gentility  
As is descended from old wealth, till ye  
Claim that for that you should be gentlemen,  
I hold such arrogance not worth a hen.  
Find him who is most virtuous alway,  
Alone or publicly, and most tries aye  
To do whatever noble deeds he can,  
And take him for the greatest gentleman.

“Christ wills we claim from Him gentility,  
Not from ancestors of land or lineage.  
For though they give us all their heritage,  
For which we claim to be of high lineage,  
Yet can they not bequeath, in anything,  
To any of us their virtuous living  
That made men say they had gentility,  
And bade us follow them in like degree.

“Well does that poet wise of great Florence,  
Called Dante, speak his mind in this sentence;  
Somewhat like this may it translated be:

‘Rarely unto the branches of the tree  
Doth human worth mount up: and so ordains  
He Who bestows it; to Him it pertains.’”

### Middle English (lines 6655–6712)

Now wolden som men seye, paraventure,  
That, for my necligence, I do no cure  
To tellen yow the joye and al th’array  
That at the feste was that ilke day.

To which thing shortly answer I shal;  
I seye, ther nas no joye ne feste at al,  
Ther nas but hevinesse and muche sorwe;  
For prively he wedded hir on a morwe,  
And al day after hidde him as an oule;  
So wo was him, his wyf looked so foule.

Greet was the wo the knight hadde in his thoght.  
Whan he was with his wyf a-bedd y-broght;  
He walweth, and he tumeth to and fro.

His olde wyf lay smylinge evermo,  
And seyde, “O dere housbond, benedicite!  
Fareth every knight thus with his wyf as ye?  
Is this the lawe of King Arthures hous?  
Is every knight of his so dangerous?  
I am your owene love and eek your wyf;  
I am she, which that saved hath your lyf;  
And certes, yet dide I yow never unright;  
Why fare ye thus with me this firste night?  
Ye faren lyk a man had lost his wit;  
What is my gilt? for Goddes love, tel me it,  
And it shal been amended, if I may.”

“Amended?” quod this knight, “Alas! nay, nay!  
It wol nat been amended never mo!  
Thou art so loothly, and so old also,  
And ther-to comen of so lowe a kinde,  
That litel wonder is, thogh I walwe and winde.  
So wolde God min herte wolde breste!”

“Is this,” quod she, “the cause of your unrest?”

“Ye, certainly,” quod he, “no wonder is.”  
“Now, sire,” quod she, “I coude amende al this,  
If that me liste, er it were dayes three.  
So wel ye mighte bere yow un-to me.

But for ye speken of swich gentillesse  
As is descended out of old richesse,  
That therfore sholden ye be gentil men,  
Swich arrogance is nat worth an hen.  
Loke who that is most vertuous alway,  
Privee and apert, and most entendeth ay  
To do the gentil dedes that he can,  
And tak him for the grettest gentil man.

Crist wol, we clayme of him our gentillesse,  
Nat of our eldres for hir old richesse.  
For thogh they yeve us al hir heritage,  
For which we clayme to been of heigh parage.  
Yet may they nat biquethe, for no-thing,  
To noon of us hir vertuous living,  
That made hem gentil men y-called be,  
And bad us folwen hem in swich degree.

Wel can the wyse poete of Florence,  
That highte Dant, speken in this sentence;  
Lo in swich maner rym is Dantes tale:

‘Ful selde up ryseth by his branches smale  
Prowesse of man; for God, of his goodnesse,  
Wol that of him we clayme our gentillesse.’”

---

For of our elders may we nothing claim  
But temporal thing, that man may hurt and maim,  
Eek every wight wot this as wel as I,  
If gentillesse were planted naturelly  
Un-to a certayn linage, doun the lync,  
Privee ne apert, than wolde they never fyne  
To doon of gentillesse the faire office;  
They mighte do no vileinye or vyce.

Tak fyr, and ber it in the derkeste hous  
Bitwix this and the mount of Caucasus,  
And lat men shette the dores and go thenne;  
Yet wol the fyr as faire lye and brenne,  
As twenty thousand men mighte it biholde;  
His office naturel ay wol it holde,  
Up peril of my lyf, til that it dye.

Heer may ye see wel, how that genterye  
Is nat annexed to possessioun,  
Sith folk ne doon hir operacioun  
Alwey, as dooth the fyr, lo! in his kinde.  
For, God it woot, men may wel often finde  
A lordes sone do shame and vileinye;  
And he that wol han prys of his gentrye  
For he was boren of a gentil hous,  
And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous,  
And nil him-selven do no gentil dedis,  
Ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed is.

He nis nat gentil, be he duk or erl;  
For vileyns sinful dedes make a cherl.  
For gentillesse nis but renomee  
Of thyne auncestres, for hir heigh bountee.  
Which is a strange thing to thy persone.  
Thy gentillesse cometh fro God allone;  
Than comth our verray gentillesse of grace,  
It was no-thing biquethe us with our place.

Thenketh how noble, as seith Valerius,  
Was thilke Tullius Hostilius,  
That out of povert roos to heigh noblesse.  
Redeth Senek, and redeth eek Boece,  
Ther shul ye seen expres that it no drede is,  
That he is gentil that doth gentil dedis;  
And therfore, leve housbond, I thus conclude,  
Al were it that myne auncestres were rude.  
Yet may the hye God, and so hope I,  
Grante me grace to liven vertuously.  
Thanne am I gentil, whan that I beginne  
To liven vertuously and weyve sinne.

And ther-as ye of povert me repreve,  
The hye God, on whom that we bileve,  
In wilful povert chees to live his lyf.  
And certes every man, mayden, or wyf,  
May understonde that Jesus, hevene king,  
Ne wolde nat chese a vicious living.  
Glad povert is an honest thing, certeyn;  
This wol Senek and othere clerkes seyn.

Who-so that halt him payd of his poverte,  
I holde him riche, al hadde he nat a sherte.  
He that coveyteth is a povre wight,  
For he wolde han that is nat in his might.  
But he that noght hath, ne coveyteth have,  
Is riche, al-though ye holde him but a knave.  
Verray povert, it singeth proprely;

Juvenal seith of povert merily:

‘The povre man, whan he goth by the weye,  
Bifore the theves he may singe and pley.’

Povrt is odious good, and, as I gess,  
A ful greet bringer out of bisiness;  
A greet amender eek of sapience  
To him that taketh it in pacience.

Povrt is this, al-though it seme eleng:  
Possession, that no wight wol chalenge.  
Povert ful ofte, whan a man is lowe,  
Maketh his God and eek him-self to knowe.  
Povert a spectacle is, as thinketh me,  
Thurgh which he may his verray frendes see.  
And therefore, sire, sin that I noght yow greve,  
Of my povert na-more ye me repreve.

Now, sire, of elde ye repreve me;  
And certes, sire, though noon auctoritee  
Were in no book, ye gentils of honour  
Sein that men sholde an old wight doon favour,  
And clepe him fader, for your gentillesse;  
And auctours shal I finden, as I gesse.

Now ther y seye, that I am foul and old,  
Than drede you noght to been a cokewold;  
For filthe and elde, al-so mote I thee,  
Been grete wardeyns up-on chastitee.  
But nathelees, sin I knowe your delyt,  
I shal fultille your worldly appetyt.

Chees now, quod she, oon of thise thinges tweye,  
To han me foul and old til that I deye,  
And be to yow a trewe humble wyf,  
And never yow displese in al my lyf;  
Or elles ye wol han me yong and fair,  
And take your aventure of the repair  
That shal be to your hous, by-cause of me,  
Or in som other place, may wel be.  
Now chees your-selven, whether that yow lyketh.”

This knight avyseth him and sore syketh,  
But atte laste he seyde in this manere,  
“My lady and my love, and wyf so dere,  
I put me in your wyse governance;  
Cheseth your-self, which may be most plesance,  
And most honour to yow and me also.  
I do no fors the whether of the two;  
For as yow lyketh, it suffiseth me.”

“Thanne have I gete of yow maistrye,” quod she,  
“Sin I may chese, and governe as me lest?”  
“Ye, certes, wyf,” quod he, “I holde it best.”  
“Kis me,” quod she, “we be no longer wrothe;  
For, by my trouthe, I wol be to yow bothe,  
This is to seyn, ye, bothe fair and good.

I prey to God that I mot sterven wood,  
But I to yow be al-so good and trewe  
As ever was wyf, sin that the world was newe.  
And, but I be to-morn as fair to sene  
As any lady, emperyce, or quene,  
That is bitwixe the est and eke the west,  
Doth with my lyf and deeth right as yow lest.  
Cast up the curtin, loke how that it is.”

And whan the knight saugh verraily al this,  
That she so fair was, and so yong ther-to,  
For joye he hente hir in his armes two.  
His herte bathed in a bath of blisse;  
A thousand time a-rewe he gan hir kisse.

And she obeyed him in every thing  
That mighte doon him plesance or liking.  
And thus they live, un-to hir lyves ende,  
In parfit joye; and Jesu Crist us sende  
Housbondes meke, yonge, and freshe a-bedde;  
And grace t’overbyde hem that we wedde.

> And eek I preye Jesu shorte hir lyves  
> That wol nat be governed by hir wyves;  
> And olde and angry nigardes of dispence,  
> God sende hem sone verray pestilence.
> 
> For joy he clasped her in his strong arms two,  
> His heart bathed in a bath of utter bliss;  
> A thousand times, all in a row, he’d kiss.  
> And she obeyed his wish in everything  
> That might give pleasure to his love-liking.  
> 
> And thus they lived unto their lives’ fair end,  
> In perfect joy; and Jesus to us send  
> Meek husbands, and young ones, and fresh in bed,  
> And good luck to outlive them that we wed.
> 
> And I pray Jesus to cut short the lives  
> Of those who’ll not be governed by their wives;  
> And old and querulous niggards with their pence,  
> And send them soon a mortal pestilence!

This worthy limiter, this noble friar,  
He turned always a lowering face, and dire,  
Upon the summoner, but for courtesy  
No rude and insolent word as yet spoke he.  

But at the last he said unto the wife:  
“Lady,” said he, “God grant you a good life!  
You have here touched, as I may prosperous be,  
Upon school matters of great difficulty;  
You have said many things right well, I say;  
But, lady, as we ride along our way,  
We need but talk to carry on our game,  
And leave authorities, in good God’s name,  
To preachers and to schools for clergymen.  
But if it pleases all this company, then,  
I’ll tell you of a summoner, to make game.  
By God, you could surmise it by the name  
That of a summoner may no good be said;  
I pray that none of you be angered.  
A summoner is a runner up and down  
With summonses for fornication known,  
And he is beaten well at each town’s end.”

Our host then spoke: “O sir, you should attend  
To courtesy, like man of your estate;  
In company here we will have no debate.  
Tell forth your tale and let the summoner be.”

“Nay,” said the summoner, “let him say to me  
What pleases him; when it falls to my lot,  
By God I’ll then repay him, every jot.  
I’ll then make plain to him what great honour  
It is to be a flattering limiter;  
I’ll certainly tell him what his business is.”

Our host replied: “Oh peace, no more of this!”  
And after that he said unto the friar:  
“Tell now your tale to us, good master dear.”

## THE FRIAR’S TALE

### HERE BEGINNETH THE FRIAR'S TALE

> Once on a time there dwelt in my country  
> An archdeacon, a man of high degree,  
> Who boldly executed the Church’s frown  
> In punishment of fornication known,  
> And of witchcraft and of all known bawdry,  
> And defamation and adultery  
> Of church-wardens, and of false testaments  
> And contracts, and the lack of sacraments,  
> And still of many another kind of crime  
> Which need not be recounted at this time,  
> And usury and simony also.
> 
> But unto lechers gave he greatest woe;  
> They should lament if they were apprehended;  
> And payers of short tithes to shame descended.  
> If anyone informed of such, ’twas plain  
> He’d not escape pecuniary pain.  
> For all short tithes and for small offering  
> He made folk pitifully to howl and sing.  
> For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,  
> They were already in the archdeacon’s book.
> 
> Then had he, by his competent jurisdiction,  
> Power to punish them by such infliction.  
> He had a summoner ready to his hand,  
> A slyer rogue was not in all England;  
> For cunningly he’d espionage to trail  
> And bring reports of all that might avail.
> 
> He could protect of lechers one or two  
> To learn of four and twenty more, mark you.  
> For though this man were wild as is a hare,  
> To tell his evil deeds I will not spare;  
> For we are out of his reach of infliction;  
> They have of us no competent jurisdiction,  
> Nor ever shall for term of all their lives.
> 
> “Peter! So are the women of the dives,”  
> The summoner said, “likewise beyond my cure!”  
> “Peace, with mischance and with misadventure!”  
> Thus spoke our host, “and let him tell his tale.  
> Now tell it on, despite the summoner’s wail,  
> Nor spare in anything, my master dear.”
> 
> This false thief then, this summoner (said the friar),  
> Had always panders ready to his hand,  
> For any hawk to lure in all England,  
> Who told him all the scandal that they knew;  
> For their acquaintances were nothing new.  
> They were all his informers privily;  
> And he took to himself great gain thereby;  
> His master knew not how his profits ran.
> 
> Without an order, and an ignorant man,  
> Yet would he summon, on pain of Christ’s curse,  
> Those who were glad enough to fill his purse  
> And feast him greatly at the taverns all.  
> And just as Judas had his purses small  
> And was a thief, just such a thief was he.  
> His master got but half of every fee.

Whilom ther was dwellinge in my contree  
An erehedeken, a man of heigh degree,  
That boldely dide execucioun  
In punisshinge of fornicacioun,  
Of wicchecraft, and eek of bauderye,  
Of diffamacioun, and avoutrye,  
Of chirche-reves, and of testaments,  
Of contractes, and of lakke of sacraments,  
And eek of many another maner cryme  
Which nedeth nat rehercen at this tyme;  
Of usure, and of symonye also.  

But certes, lechours dide he grettest wo;  
They sholde singen, if that they were hent;  
And smale tithes weren foule y-shent.  
If any persone wolde up-on hem pleyne,  
Ther mighte asterte him no pecunial peyne.  
For smale tythes and for smal offringe  
He made the peple pitously to singe.  
For er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook,  
They weren in the erchedeknes book.  

Thanne hadde he, thurgh his jurisdiccioun,  
Power to doon on hem correccioun.  
He hadde a Somnour redy to his hond,  
A slyer boy was noon in Engelond;  
For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,  
That taughte him, wher that him mighte availle.  
He coude spare of lechours oon or two,  
To techen him to foure and twenty mo.  

For thogh this Somnour wood were as an hare,  
To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare;  
For we been out of his correccioun;  
They han of us no jurisdiccioun,  
Ne never shullen, terme of alle hir lyves.  
“Peter! so been the wommen of the styves,”  
Quod the Somnour, “y-put out of my cure!”  
“Pees, with mischance and with misaventure,”  
Thus seyde our host, “and lat him telle his tale.  
Now telleth forth, thogh that the Somnour gale,  
Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister dere.”

This false theef, this Somnour, quod the Frere,  
Hadde alwey baudes redy to his hond,  
As any hauk to lure in Engelond,  
That tolde him al the secree that they knewe;  
For hir acqueyntance was nat come of newe.  
They weren hise approwours privily;  
He took him-self a greet profit therby;  
His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.  
With-outen mandement, a lewed man  
He coude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs,  
And they were gladde for to fille his purs,  
And make him grete festes atte nale.  
And right as Judas hadde purses smale,  
And was a theef, right swich a theef was he;  
His maister hadde but half his ductee.

He was, if I shall yeven him his laude,  
A theef, and eke a Somnour, and a baude.  
He hadde eke wenches at his retinue,  
That, whether that sir Robert or sir Huw,  
Or Jakke, or Rauf, or who-so that it were,  
That lay by hem, they tolde it in his ere;  
Thus was the wenche and he of oon assent.  
And he wolde fetch a feyned mandement,  
And somne hem to the chapitre bothe two,  
And file the man, and lete the wenche go.  
Thanne wolde he seye, “Frend, I shal for thy sake  
Do stryken hir out of our lettres blake;  
Thee thar na-more as in this cas travaille;  
I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle.”  

Certeyn he knew of bryberyes mo  
Than possible is to telle in yeres two.  
For in this world nis dogge for the bowe,  
That can an hurt deer from an hool y-knowe.  
Bet than this Somnour knew a sly lechour,  
Or an avouter, or a paramour.  
And, for that was the fruit of al his rente,  
Therefore on it he sette al his entente.

And so bifel, that ones on a day  
This Somnour, ever waiting on his pray,  
Rood for to somne a widwe, an old ribybe,  
Feyninge a cause, for he wolde brybe.  
And happed that he saugh bifore him ryde  
A gay yeman, under a forest-syde.  
A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene;  
He hadde up-on a courtepy of grene;  
An hat up-on his heed with frenges blake.  

“Sir,” quod this Somnour, “hayl! and wel a-take!”  
“Wel-come,” quod he, “and every good felawe!  
Wher rydestow under this grene shawe?”  
Seyde this yeman, “Wiltow fer to day?”  
This Somnour him answerde, and seyde, “nay;  
Heer faste by,” quod he, “is myn entente  
To ryden, for to reysen up a rente  
That longeth to my lordes duetee.”
“Artow thanne a bailly?”  
“Ye!” quod he.  
He dorste nat, for verray filthe and shame,  
Seye that he was a somnour, for the name.

“Depardieux,” quod this yeman, “dere brother.  
Thou art a bailly, and I am another.  
I am unknowen as in this contree;  
Of thyn aqueyntance I wolde praye thee.  
And eek of brotherhede, if that yow leste.  
I have gold and silver in my cheste;  
If that thee happe to comen in our shyre,  
Al shal be thyn, right as thou wolt desyre.”  
“Grantmercy,” quod this Somnour, “by my feith!”  

Everich in otheres hand his trouthe leith,  
For to be swome bretheren til they deye.  
In daliance they ryden forth hir weye.  
This Somnour, which that was as ful of jangles,  
As ful of venim been thise wariangles,  
And ever enquering up-on every thing.

“Brother,” asked he, “where now is your dwelling  
If some day I should wish your side to reach?”  
This yeoman answered him in gentle speech,  
“Brother,” said he, “far in the north country,  
Where, as I hope, some day you’ll come to me.  
Before we part I will direct you so  
You’ll never miss it when that way you go.”

“Now, brother,” said this summoner, “I pray  
You’ll teach me, while we ride along our way,  
Since that you are a bailiff, as am I,  
A trick or two, and tell me faithfully  
How, in my office, I may most coin win;  
And spare not for nice conscience, nor for sin,  
But as my brother tell your arts to me.”

“Now by my truth, dear brother,” then said he,  
“If I am to relate a faithful tale,  
My wages are right scanty, and but small.  
My lord is harsh to me and niggardly,  
My job is most laborious, you see;  
And therefore by extortion do I live.  
Forsooth, I take all that these men will give;  
By any means, by trick or violence,  
From year to year I win me my expense.  
I can no better tell you faithfully.”

“Now truly,” said this summoner, “so do I.  
I never spare to take a thing, God wot,  
Unless it be too heavy or too hot.  
What I get for myself, and privately,  
No kind of conscience for such things have I.  
But for extortion, I could not well live,  
Nor of such japes will I confession give.  
Stomach nor any conscience have I, none;  
A curse on father-confessors, every one.  
Well are we met, by God and by Saint James!  
But, my dear brother, tell your name or names.”

Thus said the summoner, and in meanwhile  
The yeoman just a little began to smile.

“Brother,” said he, “and will you that I tell?  
I am a fiend; my dwelling is in Hell.  
But here I ride about in hope of gain  
And that some little gilt I may obtain.  
My only income is what so is sent.  
I see you ride with much the same intent  
To win some wealth—you never care just how;  
Even so do I, for I would ride, right now,  
Unto the world’s end, all to get my prey.”

“Ah,” cried he, “benecci! What do you say?  
I took you for a yeoman certainly.  
You have a human shape as well as I;  
Have you a figure then determinate  
In Hell, where you are in your proper state?”

“Nay,” said he, “there of figure we have none;  
But when it pleases us we can take one.  
Or else we make you think we have a shape,  
Sometimes like man, or sometimes like an ape;  
Or like an angel can I seem, you know.  
It is no wondrous thing that this is so;  
A lousy juggler can deceive, you see,  
And by God, I have yet more craft than he.”

“Why,” asked the summoner, “ride you then, or go  
In sundry shape, and not always in one?”

“For we,” said he, “will us such formes make  
As most able is our preys for to take.”

“What maketh you to have all this labour?”

“Full many a cause, dear sir Summoner,”  
Said this fiend, “but all things have their time.  
The day is short, and it is passed prime,  
And yet ne won I nothing in this day.  
I will intend to win, if that I may,  
And not intend our wits to declare.  
For, brother mine, thy wit is all too bare  
To understand, although I told them thee.  
But, for thou askest why labour we;  
For, sometimes, we be God’s instruments,  
And means to do his commandments,  
When that him list, upon his creatures,  
In divers art and in divers figures.  
Withouten him we have no might, certain.  
If that him list to stonden ther-again.  
And sometimes, at our prayer, have we leave  
Only the body and not the soul grieve;  
Witness on Job, whom that we diden woe.  
And sometimes have we might of both two,  
That is to say, of soul and body eke.  
And sometimes be we suffered for to seeke  
Upon a man, and do his soul unrest,  
And not his body, and all is for the best.  
When he withstandeth our temptation,  
It is a cause of his salvation;  
Albeit that it was not our entente  
He should be sauf, but that we wolde him hente.  
And sometimes be we servant unto man,  
As to the archbishop Saint Dunstan,  
And to the apostles’ servant eke was I.”

“Yet tell me,” quod the Somnour, “faithfully.  
Make ye you new bodies thus alway  
Of elements?”

The fiend answered, “Nay;  
Somtime we feign, and sometime we arise  
With dead bodies in full sundry wise,  
And speak as reasonably and fair and well  
As to the Phitonissa did Samuel.  
And yet will some men say it was not he;  
I do no fors of your divinity.  
But one thing warn I thee, I will not jape,  
Thou wilt at all times know how we are shaped;  
Thou shalt hereafter, my brother dear,  
Come where thee needeth not of me to learn.  
For thou shalt by thine own experience  
Con in a chair read of this sentence  
Better than Virgil while he was alive,  
Or Dante also; now let us ride blyve.  
For I will hold company with thee  
Till it be so that thou forsake me.”

“Nay,” quod this Somnour, “that shall not betide;  
I am a yeoman, known is full wide;  
My troth will I hold as in this case.  
For though thou were the devil Sathanas,  
My troth will I hold to my brother,  
As I am sworn, and each of us to other  
For to be trewe brother in this case.”

In sundry shap, and not always in one?  

“For we,” said he, “will such figures make  
As best beseems the preys that we shall take.”

“Why do you labour thus?” asked the summoner.

“Full many a cause, dear sir Summoner,” replied the fiend.  
“But everything hath its time. The day is short and past prime,  
And yet have I won nothing this day. I will try to win, if I may,  
And not unfold our wits and arts to thee.  
For, brother mine, thy wit is all too poor  
To understand, though I should tell thee more.  
But since thou askest why thus we toil,  
Sometimes we are God’s own instruments,  
And means whereby He brings about His will,  
When pleases Him, on creatures all,  
In divers arts and many forms.  
Withouten Him we have no might at all,  
If He will set Himself against our will.  
And sometimes, by our prayer, we have leave  
To vex the body only, not the soul;  
As witness Job, upon whom we wrought great woe.  
And sometimes we have power of soul and body both.  
That is to say, of soul and body eke.  
And sometimes we are suffered to assay  
A man and make his soul be full unrest,  
But not his body, and that turneth to the best.  
When he withstands our temptations,  
That brings about his soul’s salvation;  
Though it was not our purpose that he should be saved,  
We would have had him fall into our hand.  
And sometimes we serve unto man,  
As unto the archbishop Saint Dunstan,  
And to the apostles’ servant once was I.”

“Yet tell me,” said the summoner, “faithfully,  
Do ye make yourselves new bodies always  
Of elements?”

The fiend answered, “Nay;  
Sometimes we feign them, sometimes we rise  
With dead bodies in divers different wise,  
And speak as reasonably, fair, and well  
As Samuel to the witch at Endor.  
Yet some will say it was not he; I care not for your divinity.  
But one thing warn I thee: I will not jape,  
Thou shalt at length know how we are shaped;  
Thou shalt hereafter, brother dear,  
Come where thou needest not to learn of me.  
For thou shalt by thine own experience  
Sit in a red chair and judge this sentence  
Better than Virgil while he lived,  
Or Dante likewise; now let us ride.  
For I will keep company with thee  
Until it be that thou forsake me.”

“Nay,” said the summoner, “that shall not betide;  
I am a yeoman known both far and wide;  
My troth will I keep in this affair.  
Though thou wert Satan himself the devil,  
My troth will I hold stedfast to my brother,  
As I am sworn, each of us to other  
To be true brethren in this case.”

## THE FRIAR’S TALE

And let us both abouten our purchas.
Tak thou thy part, what that men wol thee yive,
And I shal myn; thus may we bothe live.
And if that any of us have more than other,
Lat him be trewe, and parte it with his brother.”

“I graunte,” quod the devel, “by my fey.”
And with that word they ryden forth hir wey.
And right at the entring of the tounes ende,
To which this Somnour shoop him for to wende,
They saugh a cart, that charged was with hey,
Which that a carter droof forth in his wey.

Deep was the wey, for which the carte stood.
The carter smoot, and cryde, as he were wood,
“Hayt, Brok! hayt, Scot! what spare ye for the stones?
The feend,” quod he, “yow fecche body and bones,
As ferforthly as ever were ye foled!
So muche wo as I have with yow tholde!
The devel have al, bothe hors and cart and hey!”

This Somnour seyde, “heer shal we have a pley;”
And neer the feend he drough, as noght ne were,
Ful privily, and rouned in his ere:
“Herkne, my brother, herkne, by thy feith;
Herestow nat how that the carter seith?
Hent it anon, for he hath yeve it thee,
Bothe hey and cart, and eek hise caples three.”

“Nay,” quod the devel, “god wot, never a deel;
It is nat his entente, trust me weel.
Axe him thy-self, if thou nat trowest me,
Or elles stint a while, and thou shalt see.”

This carter thakketh his hors upon the croupe,
And they bigonne drawen and to-stoupe;
“Heyt, now!” quod he, “ther Jesu Crist yow blesse,
And al his handwerk, bothe more and lesse!
That was wel twight, myn owene lyard boy!
I pray god save thee and seynt Loy!
Now is my cart out of the slow, pardee!”

“Lo! brother,” quod the feend, “what tolde I thee?
Heer may ye see, myn owene dere brother,
The carl spak oo thing, but he thoghte another.
Lat us go forth abouten our viage;
Heer winne I no-thing up-on cariage.”

Whan that they comen som-what out of toune,
This Somnour to his brother gan to roune,
“Brother,” quod he, “heer woneth an old rebekke,
That hadde almost as lief to lese hir nekke
As for to yeve a peny of hir good.
I wol han twelf pens, though that she be wood,
Or I wol sompne hir un-to our office;
And yet, God wot, of hir knowe I no vyce.
But, for thou canst nat, as in this contree,
Winne thy cost, tak heer ensample of me.”

This Somnour clappeth at the widwes gate.
“Com out,” quod he, “thou olde she-reprobate!
I trowe thou hast som frere or preest with thee!”
“Who clappeth?” seyde this widwe, “benedicite!
God save you, sire, what is your swete wille?”

“I have,” quod he, “of somonce here a bille;
Up peync of cursing, loke that thou be
To-morn bifore the archedekenes knee
T’answere to the court of certeyn thinges.”

“Now, lord,” quod she, “Crist Jesu, king of kinges,
So wysly helpe me, as I ne mai.
I have been syk, and that ful many a day.
I may nat go so fer,” quod she, “ne ryde,
But I be deed; so priketh it in my syde.
May I nat axe a libel, sir Somnour,
And answere there, by my procurour,
To swich thing as men wol opposen me?”

“Yis,” quod this Somnour, “pay anon, lat se,
Twelf pens to me, and I wol thee acquyte.
I shall no profit han ther-by but lyte;
My maister hath the profit, and nat I.
Com of, and lat me ryden hastily;
Yif me twelf pens, I may no lenger tarie.”

“Twelf pens,” quod she, “now lady Seinte Marie
So wysly helpe me out of care and sinne,
This wyde world thogh that I sholde winne,
Ne have I nat twelf pens withinne myn hold.
Ye knowen wel that I am povre and old;
Kythe your almesse on me povre wrecche.”

“Nay than,” quod he, “the foule feend me fecche
If I th'excuse, though thou sholde be spilt!”
“Alas,” quod she, “God woot, I have no gilt.”

“Pay me,” quod he, “or by the swete Seinte Anne,
As I wol bere awey thy newe panne
For dette, which that thou owest me of old,
Whan that thou madest thyn housbond cokewold.
I payde at hoom for thy correccioun.”

“Thou lixt,” quod she, “by my savacioun!
Ne was I never er now, widwe ne wyf,
Somoned un-to your court in al my lyf;
Ne never I nas but of my body trewe!
Un-to the devel blak and rough of hewe
Yeve I thy body and my panne also!”

And whan the devel herde hir cursen so
Up-on hir knees, he seyde in this manere,
“Now Mabely, myn owene moder dere,
Is this your wil in ernest, that ye seye?”
“The devel,” quod she, “so fecche him er he deye,
And panne and al, but he wol him repente!”

“Nay, olde stot, that is nat myn entente,”
Quod this Somnour, “for to repente me,
For any thing that I have had of thee;
I wolde I hadde thy smok and every clooth!”

“Now, brother,” quod the devel, “be nat wrooth;
Thy body and this panne ben myne by right.
Thou shalt with me to helle yet to-night,
Where thou shalt knowen of our privetee
More than a maister of divinitee.”

And with that word this foule feend him hente;
Body and soule, he with the devel wente
Wher-as that somnours han hir heritage.

And God, that maked after his image
Mankinde, save and gyde us alle and some;
And grant that summoners good men become!
And leve this Somnour good man to bicome!

God save yow alle, save this cursed Frere;
My prologe wol I ende in this manere.

## THE SUMMONER’S PROLOGUE

High in his stirrups this Somnour hye stood;
Upon this Frere his herte was so wood,
That lyk an aspen leef he quook for yre.
“Lordinges,” quod he, “but o thing I desyre:
I yow biseke that, of your curteisye,
Sin ye han herd this false Frere lye,
As suffereth me I may my tale telle!
This Frere bosteth that he knoweth helle.
And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;
Freres and feendes been but lyte a-sonder.
For pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle
How that a frere ravisshed was to helle
In spirit ones by a visioun;
And as an angel ladde him up and doun,
To shewen him the peynes that ther were.
In al the place saugh he nat a frere;
Of other folk saugh he y-nowe in wo.
Un-to this angel spak the frere tho:
“Now, sir,” quod he, “han freres swich a grace
That noon of hem shal come to this place?”
“Yis,” quod this angel, “many a millioun!”
And un-to Sathanas he ladde him doun.
“And now hath Sathanas,” seith he, “a tayl
Brodder than of a carrik is the sayl.
Hold up thy tayl, thou Sathanas!” quod he,
“Shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere see
Wher is the nest of freres in this place!”
And, er that half a furlong-wey of space,
Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,
Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve
Twenty thousand freres in a route.
And thurgh-out helle swarmeden aboute
And comen agayn, as faste as they may gon,
And in his ers they crepten everichon.
He clapte his tayl agayn, and layful stille.
This frere, whan he loked hadde his fille
Upon the torments of this sory place,
His spirit God restored of his grace
Un-to his body agayn, and he awook;
But natheles, for fere yet he quook.
So was the develes ers ay in his minde,
That is his heritage of verray kinde.
God save yow alle, save this cursed Frere;
My prologe wol I ende in this manere.

Here endeth the Prologe of the Summoner’s Tale.

## THE SUMMONER’S TALE

Lordinges, ther is in Yorkshire, as I gesse,
A mersshy contree called Holdernesse,
In which ther wente a limitour aboute
To preche, and eek to begge, it is no doute.
And so bifel, that on a day this frere
Had preched at a chirche in his manere.
And specially, aboven every thing,
Excited he the peple in his preching
To trentals, and to yeve, for Goddes sake,
Wher-with men mighten holy houses make,
Ther-as divyne service is honoured,
Nat ther as it is wasted and devoured,
Ne ther it nedeth nat for to be yive,
As to possessioners, that mowen live,
Thanked be God, in wele and habundaunce.
“Trentals,” seyde he, “deliveren fro penaunce
Hir freendes soules, as wel olde as yonge,
Ye, whan that they been hastily y-songe;
Nat for to holde a preest joly and gay,
He singeth nat but o masse in a day;
Delivereth out,” quod he, “anon the soules;
Ful hard it is with fleshhook or with oules
To been y-clawed, or to brenne or bake;
Now spede yow hastily, for Cristes sake.”

And whan this frere had seyd al his entente,
With cui cum patre forth his wey he wente.
Whan folk in chirche had yeve him what hem leste,
He wente his wey, no lenger wolde he reste.
With scrippe and tipped staf, y-tukked hye;
In every hous he gan to poure and prye.
And beggeth mele, and chese, or elles corn.
His felawe hadde a staf tipped with horn,
A peyre of tables al of yvory,
And a poyntel polisshed fetisly.
And wroot the names alwey, as he stood,
Of alle folk that yaf him any good,
As if for hem he wolde for ever preye;
“Yevus a busshel whete, or a goddes kechil,
A busshel; or a Goddes cake; or some chese;
Or elles what yow list, we may nat chese;
A goddes halfpeny or a masse-peny,
Or yeve us of your brawn, if ye have eny;
A dagon of your blanket, leve dame,
Our suster dere, lo! here I write your name;
Bacon or beef, or swich thing as ye finde.”

A sturdy harlot wente ay hem bihinde,
That was hir hostes man, and bar a sak,
And what men yaf hem, leyd it on his bak.
And whan that he was out at dore anon,
He planed awey the names everichon
That he biforn hadde writen in his tables;
He served hem with nyfles and with fables.
“Nay, ther thou lixt, thou Somnour,” quod the Frere.
“Pees,” quod our Host, “for Cristes moder dere;
Tel forth thy tale and spare it nat at al.”
So thryve I,” quod this Somnour, “so I shal.”

So longe he wente hous by hous, til he
Cam til an hous ther he was wont to be
Refresshed more than in an hundred placis.
Sik lay the gode man, whos that the place is;
Bedrede up-on a couche lowe he lay.
“Dews hie,” quod he, “O Thomas, freend, good day,”
Seyde this frere curteisly and softe.
“Thomas,” quod he, “God yelde yow! ful ofte
Have I up-on this bench faren ful weel.
Here have I eten many a mery meel”;
And fro the bench he droof awey the cat,
And leyde adoun his potente and his hat,
And eek his scrippe, and sette him softe adoun.
His felawe was go walked in-to toun,
Forth with his knave, in-to that hostelrye
Wher-as he shoop him thilke night to lye.

“O dere maister,” quod this syke man,
“How han ye fare sith that March bigan?
I saugh yow noght this fourtenight or more.”
“God woot,” quod he, “laboured have I ful sore;
And specially, for thy savacioun
Have I seyd many a precious orisoun,
And for our othere frendes, God hem blesse!
I have to-day been at your chirche at messe,
And seyd a sermon after my simple wit,
Nat al after the text of holy writ;
For it is hard to yow, as I suppose,
And therfore wol I teche yow al the glose.
Glosinge is a glorious thing, certeyn,
For lettre sleeth, so as we clerkes seyn.
Ther have I taught hem to be charitable,
And spende hir good ther it is resonable.
And ther I saugh our dame; a! wher is she?”
“Yond in the yerd I trowe that she be,”
Seyde this man, “and she wol come anon.”
“Ey, maister! wel-come be ye, by seint John!”
Seyde this wyf, “how fare ye hertely?”

The frere aryseth up ful curteisly,
And hir embraceth in his armes narve,
And kiste hir swete, and chirketh as a sparwe
With his lippes: “dame,” quod he, “right weel.
As he that is your servant everydeel.
Thanked be God, that yow yaf soule and lyf,
Yet saugh I nat this day so fair a wyf
In al the chirche, God so save me!”
“Ye, God amende defautes, sir,” quod she,
“Algates wel-come be ye, by my fey!”
“Graunt mercy, dame, this have I founde alwey.
But of your grete goodnesse, by your leve,
I wolde preye yow that ye nat yow greve,
I wol with Thomas speke a litel throwe.
Thise curats been ful necligent and slowe
To grope tendrely a conscience.
In shrift, in preching is my diligence,
And studie in Peteres wordes, and in Poules.
I walke, and fisshe Cristen mennes soules,
To yelden Jesu Crist his propre rente;
To sprede his word is set al myn entente.”

“Now, by your leve, o dere sir,” quod she,
“Chydeth him weel, for seint Trinitee.
He is as angry as a pissemyre,
Though that he have al that he can desyre.
Though I him wrye a-night and make him warm,
And on hym leye my leg outher myn arm,
He groneth lyk our boor, lyth in our sty.
Other desport right noon of him have I;
I may nat plese him in no maner cas.”

“O Thomas! Je voids dy, Thomas! Thomas!
This maketh the feend, this moste ben amended.
Ire is a thing that hye God defended,
And ther-of wol I speke a word or two.”

“Now maister,” quod the wyf, “er that I go,
What wol ye dyne? I wol go ther-aboute.”
“Now dame,” quod he, “Je vous dy sanz doute,
Have I nat of a capon but the livere,
And of your softe breed nat but a shivere.
And after that a rosted pigges heed,
(But that I nolde no beest for me were deed),
Thanne hadde I with yow hoomly suffisaunce.
I am a man of litel sustenaunce.
My spirit hath his fostring in the Bible.

## The Summoner’s Tale

### Modern English

The body is aye so ready and pensive  
To wake, that my stomach is destroyed.  
I pray you, dame, you be not annoyed.

Though I so friendly you my counsel shew;  
By God, I would not tell it but a few.

“Now, sir,” quoth she, “but one word ere I go;  
My child is dead within this fortnight—oh,  
Soon after you left town last, it did die.”

“His death saw I by revelation,”  
Replied this friar, “at home in our dormitory.  
Less than an hour, I dare say, ere to glory,  
After his death, I saw him borne in bliss  
In vision mine, may God me guide in this!

So did our sexton and infirmarian,  
Who have been true friars fifty years, each man;  
And may now, God be thanked for mercy shown,  
Observe their jubilee and walk alone.

The friar arose, and courteously,  
And her embraced within his two arms narrow,  
And kissed her sweetly, chirping like a sparrow  
With his two lips. “Ah, dame,” said he, “right well,  
As one that is your servant, let me tell,  
Thanks be to God Who gave you soul and life,  
For saw I not this day so fair a wife  
In all the congregation, God save me!”

“Yea, God correct all faults, sir,” answered she,  
“But you are always welcome, by my fay!”

“Many thanks, dame, this have I found alway.  
But of your innate goodness, by your leave,  
I’d beg of you you will not be cross or grieve  
If I with Thomas speak a little now.  
These curates are right negligent and slow  
In searching tenderly into conscience.  
To preach confession is my diligence,  
And I do study Peter’s words and Paul’s.  
I walk and fish for Christian persons’ souls  
To yield to Jesus Christ His increment;  
To spread His gospel is my whole intent.”

“Now, by your leave, O my dear sir,” said she,  
“Berate him well, for Holy Trinity.  
He is as crabbed as an old pismire,  
Though he has everything he can desire.  
Though him I cover at night, and make him warm,  
And lay my leg across him, or my arm,  
He grunts and groans like our old boar in sty,  
And other sport—just none from him have I.  
I cannot please him, no, in any case.”

“O Thomas, _je vous dis_, Thomas, Thomas!  
This is the Fiend’s work, this must be amended;  
Anger’s a thing that makes High God offended,  
And thereof will I speak a word or two.”

“Now, master,” said the wife, “before I go,  
What will you eat? I will about it scoot.”

“Now, dame,” said he then, “_je vous dis_, sans doute,  
Had I of a fat capon but the liver,  
And of your soft white bread naught but a sliver,  
And after that a pig’s head well roasted  
(Save that I would no beast for me were dead),  
Then had I with you plain sufficiency,  
I am a man of little gluttony.  
My spirit has its nourishment in the Bible.  
My body is so inured and so pliable  
To watching, that my appetite’s destroyed.  
I pray you, lady, be you not annoyed  
Though I so intimately my secret show;  
By God, I would reveal it to but few.”

“Now, sir,” said she, “but one word ere I go;  
My child has died within this fortnight—oh,  
Soon after you left town last, it did die.”

“His death saw I by revelation,”  
Replied this friar, “at home in the dormitory;  
Less than an hour, I dare say, ere to glory,  
After his death I saw him borne in bliss  
In my vision—may God me guide in this!  
So did our sexton and our infirmarian,  
Who have been true friars fifty years, each man;  
And may now, God be thanked for mercy shown,  
Observe their jubilee and walk alone.

And I rose up and did my brothers seek,  
And up I rose, and all our convent eke,  
With many a tear down trickling on my cheek,  
And without noise or clattering of the bells;  
The death-song was our song and nothing else,  
Save that to Christ I said an orison,  
And thanked Him for the vision He had shown.

For, sir and dame, trust me full well in all,  
Our orisons are more effectual,  
And more we see of Christ’s own secret things  
Than folk of the laity, though they were kings.  
We live in poverty and abstinence,  
And laymen live in riches and expense  
Of meat and drink, and in their gross delight.  
This world’s desires we hold in great despite.  
Dives and Lazarus lived differently,  
And different recompense they had thereby.  
Whoso would pray, he must fast and be clean,  
Fatten his soul and keep his body lean.

We fare as says the apostle; clothes and food  
Suffice us, though they be not over-good.  
The cleanness and the fasting of us friars  
Result in Christ’s accepting all our prayers.

“Lo, Moses forty days and forty nights  
Fasted before the mightiest God of mights,  
Spake with him on the Mount of Sinai.  
With empty belly, fasting long, say I,  
Received he there the law that had been writ  
By God’s hand; and Elias, well you witen,  
On Mount Horeb, ere he had any speech  
With the High God, Who is our spirits’ leech,  
He fasted long and was in deep contemplation.

“Aaron, who ruled the temple of his nation,  
And all the other great priests every one,  
When they into the temple would be gone  
To pray there for the folk and do their rites,  
They would not drink of that which man excites  
And makes him drunk or stirs in any way,  
But there in abstinence they’d watch and pray,  
Lest they should die—take heed to what I say!—  
Were they not sober when they prayed, indeed?  
Beware my words. No more! for it suffices.

Our Lord Christ, as the holy writ apprises,  
Gave us example of fasting and of prayers.  
Therefore we mendicants, we simple friars,  
Are sworn to poverty and continence,  
To charity, meekness, and abstinence,  
To persecution for our righteousness,  
To weeping, pity, and to cleanliness.

And therefore may you see that all our prayers—  
I speak of us, we mendicants, we friars—  
Are to the High God far more acceptable  
Than yours, with all the feasts you make at table.  
From Paradise, if I am not to lie,  
Was man chased out because of gluttony;  
And chaste was man in Paradise, that’s plain.

“But hear now, Thomas, lest I speak in vain.  
I have no text for it, I must admit,  
But by analogy the words will fit.  
That specially our sweet Lord Christ Jesus  
Spoke this by friars, when He said thus:  
‘Blessed are they that are poor in spirit.’  
And so forth all the gospel may you see.

Whether the Word fit better our profession  
Or theirs, the monks’, who swim in rich possession,  
Fie on their pomp and on their gluttony!  
And for their lewdness I do them defy.

“It seems to me they’re like Jovinian,  
Fat as a whale and waddling as a swan;  
As full of wine as bottle in the spence.  
Their prayers are always of great reverence,  
When they for souls the psalm of David say:  
‘Cor meum eructavit’—but off!—that way!  
Who follow Christ’s Word going on before  
But we who are so humble, chaste, and poor,  
And doers of God’s Word, not hearers merely?  
As falcons rise to heaven, just so clearly  
Spring up into the air the holy prayers  
Of charitable and chaste and toiling friars,  
Make their way upward into God’s twofold ears.  
Thomas, O Thomas! As I ride or go,  
And by that lord whom all we call Saint Yves,  
Were you not brother to us, you’d not thrive!  
In our chapter we pray both day and night  
To Christ, that He will send you health and might  
To move about again, and speedily.”

“God knows,” said he, “nothing thereof feel I;  
So help me Christ, as I, these last few years,  
Have spent on divers friars, it appears,  
Full many a pound; and I’m no better yet.  
Truly my wealth have I almost upset.  
Farewell my gold! for it has slipped away.”

The friar replied: “Ah, Thomas, so you say!  
But why need you to different friars reach?  
Why should he need, who has a perfect leech,  
To call in other leeches from the town?  
Your trouble from your fickleness has grown.  
Think you that I, or at least our convent,  
Could not suffice to pray? That’s what I meant.  
Thomas, your feeble joke’s not worth a tittle;  
Your illness lasts because you’ve given too little.

“‘Ah, give that convent bushels four of oats!’  
‘Ah, give that convent four and twenty groats!’  
‘Ah, give that friar a penny and let him go!’  
Nay, nay, Thomas, the thing should not be so!  
What is a farthing worth, when split twelve ways?  
A thing in its integrity displays  
Far greater strength than does a unit scattered.  
Thomas, by me you shall not here be flattered;  
You would you had our labour all for naught.

But the High God, Who all this world hath wrought,  
Says that the workman is worthy of his hire.  
Thomas! Naught of your treasure I desire  
As for myself, but that all our convent  
To pray for you is always diligent,  
And also to build up Christ’s holy kirk.  
Thomas! If you will learn the way to work,  
Of building up of churches you may find  
(If it be good) in Thomas’ life of Inde.

You lie here, full of anger and of ire,  
Wherewith the Devil set your heart afire,  
And you chide here this hapless innocent,  
Your wife, who is so meek and so patient.  
And therefore, Thomas, trust me if you please,  
Scold not your wife, who tries to give you ease;

And bear this word away now, by thy faith,  
Touching this thing, lo, what the wise man saith:  
‘Within thy house be not the lion bold;  
Oppress thy subjects in no kind of way;  
Nor make thy acquaintances not to flee.’  
And Thomas, yet again I charge thee, be  
Wary of her that in thy bosom sleeps;  
Beware the serpent that so slyly creeps  
Under the grass and stings so treacherously.

Beware, my son, and hear this patiently,  
That twenty thousand men have lost their lives  
For quarrelling with their sweet ones and their wives.  
Now, since you have so holy and meek a wife,  
Why need you, Thomas, so to stir up strife?  
There is, indeed, no serpent so cruel,  
When man treads on his tail, nor half so fell,  
As woman is when she is filled with ire;  
Vengeance is then the whole of her desire.

Anger’s a sin, one of the deadly seven,  
Abominable unto the God of Heaven;  
And it is sure destruction unto one.  
This every vulgar vicar or parson  
Can say, how anger leads to homicide.  
Anger is, in sooth, executant of pride.  
I could of anger tell you so much sorrow  
My tale should last until it were tomorrow.

And therefore I pray God both day and night,  
An ireful man, God send him little might!  
It is great harm and truly great pity  
To set an ireful man in high degree.

“For once there was an ireful potentate,  
(As Seneca says) and while he ruled the state,  
Upon a day out riding went knights two,  
And as Dame Fortune willed it, it was so  
That one of them came home, and one did not.  
Anon that knight before the judge was brought,  
Who said thus: ‘Sir, you have your fellow slain,  
For which I doom you to the death, amain.’  
And to another knight commanded he,  
‘Go lead him to his death, so I charge ye.’

It happened, as they went along their way,  
Toward the place where he must die that day,  
They met the knight that men had thought was dead.  
Then thought they, it were best not go ahead,  
And so led both unto the judge again.  
They said: ‘O lord, this knight, he has not slain  
His fellow; for he stands here sound, alive.’  
‘You shall die then,’ he cried, ‘so may I thrive!  
That is to say, you shall all die, all three!’

And then to the first knight ’twas thus said he:  
‘I doomed you, and therefore you must be dead.  
And you, also, must needs now lose your head,  
Since you’re the causing of your fellow’s end.’  
And then on the third knight did he descend:  
‘You have not done what I ordained should be!’  
And thus he did away with all the three.

“Ireful Cambyses was a drunkard too,  
And much delighted dirty deeds to do.  
And so befell, a lord of his household,  
Who loved all moral virtue, we are told,  
Said on a day, when they were talking, thus: ‘A lord is lost if he be too vicious;  
And drunkenness is a foul tiling to record  
Of any man, and specially of a lord.

There is full many an eye and many an ear  
Waiting on a lord, and he not aware.  
For God’s love, drink more temperately;  
Wine makes a man to lose, wretchedly,  
His mind, and eke his limbs every one.’

“The reverse shall you see anon,” quoth he;  
“And prove it, by your own experience,  
That wine ne dooth to folk no such offence.  
There is no wine bereveth me my might  
Of hand nor foot, nor of my eyen sight!”  
And, for despite, he drank full much the more,  
A hundred times more than he had done before;

And right anon, this ireful cursed wretch  
Let this knight’s son before him fetch,  
Commanding him he should before him stand.  
And suddenly he took his bow in hand,  
And up the string he pulled to his ear,  
And with an arrow he slew the child right there:  
“Now whether have I a sure hand or none?”  
Quoth he, “is all my might and mind agone?  
Has wine bereft me my eyesight?”

What should I tell the answer of the knight?  
His son was slain, there is no more to say.  
Beware therefore with lords how ye play.  
Singeth Placebo, and I shall, if I can,  
But—if it be unto a poor man.  
To a poor man men should his vices tell,  
But not to a lord, though he should go to Hell.

Lo, ireful Cyrus, that great Persian king,  
How he destroyed the river Gyndes’ spring,  
Because a horse of his was drowned therein  
When that he went to Babylon to win,  
He made that the river was so small,  
That women might wade it overal.  
Lo, what said he, that so well teaching can?  
“Ne be no felawe to an ireful man,  
Ne with no wood man walk by the way;  
Lest thee repente”—there is no more to say.

“Now Thomas, lieve brother, leave thy ire;  
Thou shalt me find as just as is a squire.  
Hold not the Devil’s knife aye at thy heart;  
Thy anger doth thee almost sore smart;  
But show to me all thy confession.”  

“Nay,” quoth the sick man, “by Saint Simeon!  
I have been shriven this day at my curate;  
I have him told all wholly my estate;  
Needeth no more to speak of it,” saith he,  
“But if me list of my humility.”

“Give me then of thy gold, to make our cloister,”  
Quoth he, “for many a mussel and many an oyster,  
When other men have been full well at ease,  
Hath been our food, our cloister for to raise.  
And yet, God wot, unnethe the fundament  
Parfumed is, nor of our pavement  
Is not a tile yet within our wones;  
By God, we owe forty pounds for stones!  
Now help, Thomas, for Him that harrowed Hell!  
For else must we our books sell.”

And if you laymen lack our high instruction,  
Then will the world go all to its destruction.  
For whoso shall deny us right to live,  
So may God save me, Thomas, by your leave,  
He’ll have deprived the whole world of the sun.  
For who can teach and work as we have done?  
And that’s not been for little time,” said he;  
“Elias and Elisha used to be  
Friars, you’ll find the scriptures do record,  
And beggars too, thanks be to the good Lord!

Now, Thomas, help for holy charity!”  
And down he went then, kneeling on one knee.  
This sick man, he went near mad for ire;  
He would have had that friar set afire  
For the hypocrisy that he had shown.

“Such things as I possess and are my own,”  
Said he, “those may I give you and no other.  
You tell me that I am as your own brother?”  
“Yea, truly,” said the friar, “trust me well;  
I gave your wife a letter with our seal.”  
“That’s well,” said he, “and something will I give  
Unto your holy convent while I live,  
And right anon you’ll have it in your hand,  
On this condition only, understand,  
That you divide it so, my own dear brother,  
That every friar shall have as much as other.  
This shall you swear upon the faith you own,  
And without fraud or cavil, be it known.”

“I swear it,” said this friar, “on my faith!”  
And on the sick man’s hand he laid his hand therewith.  
“Lo, hear my oath! In me shall truth not lack.”

“Now then, come put your hand right down my back,”  
Replied this man, “and grope you well behind;  
For underneath my buttocks shall you find  
A thing that I have hid in privity.”

“Ah,” thought the friar, “this shall go with me!”  
And down he thrust his hand right to the cleft,  
In hope that he should find there some good gift.  
And when the sick man felt the friar here  
Groping about his hole and all his rear,  
Into his hand he let the friar a fart.

### Middle English

The body is ay so redy and pensive  
To wake, that my stomak is destroyed.  
I prey yow, dame, ye be nat anoyed.

Though I so freendly yow my conseil shewe;  
By God, I wolde nat telle it but a fewe.

“Now, sir,” quod she, “but o word ere I go;  
My child is deed within thise wykes two,  
Sone after that ye wente out of this toun.”

“His deeth saugh I by revelacioun,”  
Seith this frere, “at hoom in our dortour.  
I dar wel seyn that, er that half an hour  
After his deeth, I saugh him born to blisse  
In myn avisioun, so God me wisse!

So dide our sexteyn and our fermerer,  
That han been trewe freres fifty yeer;  
They may now, God be thanked of his lone,  
Maken hir jubilee and walke allone.

The frere arose, and that full courteously,  
And her embraced within his two arms narrow,  
And kissed her sweetly, chirping like a sparrow  
With his two lips. “Ah, dame,” said he, “right well,  
As one that is your servant, let me tell,  
Thanks be to God Who gave you soul and life,  
For saw I not this day so fair a wife  
In all the congregation, God save me!”

“Yea, God correct all faults, sir,” answered she,  
“But thou art always welcome, by my fay!”

“Many thanks, dame, this have I found alway.  
But of your graciousness, by your leve,  
I wolde pray you that ye n’olde not greve,  
If I with Thomas speke a litel throwe.  
These curates ben right negligent and slow  
In searching tendrely into consciencie.  
To preche confessioun is myn diligence,  
And I doon studie Peteres wordes and Paul’s.  
I walke and fishe for Cristen persones’ soules,  
To yelden to Jesu Christ his increase;  
To sprede his gospel is my ful entent.”

“Now, by thy leve, O my dere sire,” quod she,  
“Berate him wel, for Holy Treinite.  
He is as crabbed as an old pismere,  
Though he hath al that he can desire.  
Though him I covere at night, and make him warm,  
And ley my leg across him, or my arm,  
He gruntteth and he groaneth as a bore in stye,  
And other sport—no thing of him have I.  
I can nat plese him in no maner cas.”

“O Thomas, _je vous dis_, Thomas, Thomas!  
This is the Fiendes werk, this mot be amended;  
Angre is a thing that maketh God offended,  
And therof wol I speke a word or two.”

“Now, maister,” quod the wyf, “er I go,  
What wol yee eten? I wol about it go.”

“Now, dame,” quod he then, “_je vous dis_, sans doute,  
Had I of a fat capoun but the lyver,  
And of your soft whit bred naught but a scliver,  
And after that a pigges heed wel rost,  
(Sauf that I wolde no beast for me were ded),  
Than hadde I with you pleyn suffisaunce,  
For I am a man of litel glotonye.  
My spirit hath his nouriture in the Bible.  
My body is so inured and so pliable  
To walching, that my appetite is desroyed.  
I prey you, lady, be ye not anoyed  
Though I so prively my secretes shewe;  
By God, I wolde revele it to but fewe.”

“Now, sir,” quod she, “but o word er I go;  
My child is deed within this fourtenight—oh,  
Soon after ye left the toun, it did dye.”

“His deeth say I by revelacioun,”  
Answerde this frere, “at home in our dortour;  
Less than an hour, I dar wel seyn, er to glorie,  
After his deeth, I saugh him borne in blisse  
In myn avisioun, God it woot, so wisse!  
So dide our sexton and our infirmar,  
That han been fulfild of freres fifty yeer;  
And may now, God be thanked, of his grace,  
Plyen hir jubile and walke alone.

And I roos up and seke myn bretheren,  
And up I roos, and al our covent eke,  
With many a ter trickling down myn cheke,  
And with-outen noyse or clater of belles;  
Thurghout was oure song and na-more elles,  
Save that to Crist I seid an orisoun,  
Thanking him of his revelacioun.

For sir and dame, trusteth me right weel,  
Our orisouns been more effectyve wel,  
And more we seen of Cristes secree thinges  
Than burel folk, al-though they were kinges.  
We live in povert and in abstinence,  
And burel folk in richesse and dispence  
Of mete and drinke, and in hir foule delyt.  
We han this worldes lust al in despyt.  
Lazar and Dives liveden diversly,  
And diverse guerdon hadden they ther-by.  
Whoso wol preye, he moot faste and be clene,  
And fatte his soule and make his body lene.

We fare as seith the apostle; cloth and fode  
Suffyssen us, though they be nat ful gode.  
The clennesse and the fastinge of us freres  
Maketh that Crist accepteth our preyeres.

Lo, Moyses fourty dayes and fourty night  
Fasted, er that the heighe God of might  
Spak with him in the Mount of Sinay.  
With empty wombe, faste many a day,  
Receyved he the lawe that was writen  
With Goddes finger; and Elie, wel ye witen,  
In Mount Oreb, er he hadde any speche  
With highe God, that is our lives leche,  
He fasted longe and was in contemplaunce.

Aaron, that hadde the temple in governaunce,  
And eek the othere preestes everichon,  
In-to the temple whan they sholde gon  
To preye for the peple, and do servyse,  
They nolden drinken in no maner wys;  
No drinke, which that mighte hem dronke make,  
But there in abstinence preye and wake,  
Lest that they deyden; tak heed what I seye.  
But they be sobre that for the peple preye.  
War that I seye; namore! for it suffyseth.

Our Lord Jesu, as holy writ devyseth,  
Yaf us ensample of fastinge and of preyeres.  
Therfor we mendinants, we sely freres,  
Been wedded to poverte and continence,  
To charitee, humblesse, and abstinence,  
To persecucion for rightwisnesse,  
To wepinge, misericorde, and clennesse.

And therfor may ye se that our preyeres—  
I speke of us, we mendinants, we freres—  
Ben to the hye God more acceptable  
Than youres, with your festes at the table.  
Fro Paradys first, if I shal nat lye,  
Was man out chaced for his glotonye;  
And chaast was man in Paradys, certeyn.

But herkne now, Thomas, what I shal seyn.  
I ne have no text of it, as I suppose,  
But I shal finde it in a maner glose,  
That specially our swete Lord Jesu  
Spak this by freres, whan he seyde thus:  
“Blessed be they that povre in spirit been.”  
And so forth al the gospel may ye seen.

Whether it be likker our profession,  
Or hir’s that swimmen in possessioun.  
Fy on hir pompe and on hir glotonye!  
And for hir lewdnesse I hem defye.  
Me thinketh they ben lik Jovinian,  
Fat as a whale, and walking as a swan;  
Al vinolent as botel in the spence.  
Hir preyer is of ful gret reverence;  
Whan they for soules seye the psalm of Davit,  
Lo, “Cor meum eructavit”—‘bouf!’ they say, that it!

Who folweth Cristes gospel and his lore,  
But we that humble been and chast and pore,  
Werkers of Goddes word, not auditours?  
Therfore, right as an hauk up at a sours  
Up springeth into the aire, right so our praiers  
Of charitable and chaste bisy freres  
Maken hir sours to Goddes eres two.  
Thomas! Thomas! so mote I ryde or go,  
And by that lord that clepeth is Seint Yve,  
Nere thou our brother, sholdest thou nat thryve!  
In our chapitre praie we day and night  
To Crist, that he thee sende hele and might,  
Thy body for to welde hastily.”

“God wot,” quod he, “no-thing ther-of fele I;  
As help me Crist, as I, in fewe yeres,  
Han spended, upon divers maner freres,  
Full many a pound; yet fare I never the bet.  
Certeyn, my good have I almost biset.  
Farwel, my gold! for it is al ago!”

The frere answerde, “O Thomas, dostow so?  
What nedeth yow diverse freres seche?  
What nedeth him that hath a parfit leche  
To sechen othere leches in the toun?  
Your inconstance is your confusioun.  
Holde ye than me, or elles our covent,  
To preye for yow be insufficient?  
Thomas, that jape his nat worth a myte;  
Your maladye is for we han to lyte.

‘A! yif that covent half a quarter otes!’  
‘A! yif that covent four and twenty grotes!’  
‘A! yif that frere a peny, and lat him go!’  
Nay, nay, Thomas! it may no-thing be so.  
What is a ferthing worth parted in twelve?  
Lo, ech thing that is oned in himselfe  
Is more strong than whan it is to-scatred.  
Thomas, of me thou shalt nat been yflattered;  
Thou woldest han our labour al for noght.

The hye God, that al this world hath wrought,  
Seith that the werkman worthy is his hyre.  
Thomas! noght of your tresor I desyre  
As for myself, but that al our covent  
To preye for yow is ay so diligent,  
And for to builden Cristes owene chirche.  
Thomas! if ye wol leren for to wirche,  
Of building up of chirches may ye finde,  
If it be good, in Thomas lyf of Inde.

Ye lie heer, ful of anger and of yre,  
With which the devil set your herte a-fyre,  
And chyden heer this sely innocent,  
Your wyf, that is so meke and pacient.  
And therfor, Thomas, trowe me if thee leste,  
Ne stryve nat with thy wyf, as for thy beste;

And bere this word awey now, by thy feith,  
Touchinge this thinge, lo, what the wyse seith:  
‘Within thy hous ne be thou no leon;  
To thy subgits do no oppressioun;  
Ne make thy acqueyntance nat to flee.’  
And Thomas, yet eftsones I charge thee,  
Be war fro hir that in thy bosom slepeth;  
War fro the serpent that so slyly crepeth  
Under the gras, and stingeth subtilly.

Be war, my sone, and herkne paciently,  
That twenty thousand men han lost her lyves,  
For stryving with her lemmans and her wyves.  
Now sith ye han so holy and meke a wyf,  
What nedeth yow, Thomas, to maken stryf?  
Ther nis, ywis, no serpent so cruel,  
Whan man tret on his tayl, ne half so fel,  
As womman is whan she hath caught an ire;  
Vengeance is thanne al that they desyre.

Ire is a sinne, oon of the grete of sevene,  
Abhominable unto the God of Hevene;  
And to himself it is destruccion.  
This every lewed vikar or person  
Can seye, how Ire engendreth homicyde.  
Ire is, in sooth, executour of pride.  
I coude of Ire seye so muche sorwe,  
My tale sholde laste til to-morwe.

And therfor preye I God bothe day and night,  
An irous man, God sende him litel might!  
It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee,  
To sette an irous man in heigh degree.

Whilom ther was an irous potestat,  
As seith Senek, that, duringe his estaat,  
Upon a day out riden knightes two,  
And as fortune wolde that it were so,  
That oon of hem cam hoom, that other noght.  
Anon the knight bifore the juge is broght,  
That seyde thus, ‘Thou hast thy feiawe slayn;  
For which I deme thee to the deeth, certeyn.’

And to another knight comanded he,  
‘Go lede him to the deeth, I charge thee.’  
And happed, as they wente by the weye  
Toward the place ther he sholde deye,  
The knight cam, which men wende hadden be deed.  
Thanne thoughte they, it was the beste reed,  
To lede hem bothe to the juge again.  
They seiden, ‘Lord, the knight ne hath nat slayn  
His feiawe; here he standeth hool, alive.’

‘Ye shul be deed,’ quod he, ‘so moot I thrive!  
That is to seyn, bothe oon, and two, and three!’  
And to the firste knight right thus spak he,  
‘I dampned thee, thou most algate be deed.  
And thou also most nedes lese thy heed,  
For thou art cause why thy feiawe deyth.’

And to the thridde knight right thus he seyde,  
‘Thou hast nat doon that I comanded thee.’  
And thus he dide don sleen hem alle three.

Irous Cambyses was eek dronkelewe,  
And ay delyted him to been a shrewe.  
And so bifel, a lord of his meyne,  
That lovede vertu and moralitee,  
Seide on a day bitwix hem two right thus:

‘A lord is lost if he be vicious;  
And dronkenesse is eek a foule record  
Of any man, and namely in a lord.  
Ther is ful many an eye and many an ere  
Awaiting on a lord, and he nat wot where.  
For Goddes love, drink more attemprely;  
Wyn maketh man to lesen wrecchedly  
His minde, and eek his limes everichon.’

‘The rever so shaltow see anon,’ quod he,  
‘And preve it by thy owene experience,  
That wyn ne dooth to folk no swich offence.  
Ther is no wyn bireveth me my might  
Of hand ne foot, ne of myn eyen sight!’  
And for despit he drank ful muchel more,  
An hundred part than he hadde doon bifore;

And right anon this irous cursed wrecche  
Let this knightes sone bifore him fecche,  
Comaundinge him he sholde bifore him stonde.  
And sodeynly he took his bowe in honde,  
And up the streng he pulled to his ere,  
And with an arwe he slow the child right there:  
‘Now whether have I a siker hand or noon?’  
Quod he, ‘is al my might and mynde agoon?  
Hath wyn bireved me myn eyen sight?’

What sholde I telle the answer of the knight?  
His sone was slayn, ther is na-more to seye.  
Beth war therfor with lordes how ye pleye.  
Singeth Placebo, and I shal, if I can,  
But if it be unto a povre man.  
To a povre man men sholde his vices telle,  
But nat to a lord, though he sholde go to helle.

Lo, irous Cyrus, thilke Percien kyng,  
How he destroyed the ryver of Gyndes ryng,  
For that an hors of his was dreynt therein  
When that he wente Babiloyne to winne.  
He made that the ryver was so smal,  
That wommen mighten wade it overal.

Lo, what seith he that so wel teche can?  
‘Ne be no felawe to an irous man,  
Ne with no wood man walke by the weye;  
Lest thee repente; ther nis na-more to seye.’

Now Thomas, leve brother, leve thy ire;  
Thou shalt me finde as just as is a squire.  
Hold nat the develes knyf ay at thy herte;  
Thyn angre dooth thee al to sore smerte;  
But shewe to me al thy confessioun.”

“Nay,” quod the syke man, “by Seint Simoun!  
I have be shriven this day at my curat;  
I have him told al hoolly myn estat;  
Nedeth na-more to speke of it,” seith he,  
“But if me liste of myn humilitee.”

“Yif me than of thy gold, to make our cloistre,”  
Quod he, “for many a muscle and many an oistre,  
Whan other men han ben ful wel at ese,  
Hath been our foode, our cloistre for to reise.  
And yet, God woot, unnethe the fundement  
Parfumed is, ne of our pavement  
Is nat a tyle yet with-inne our wones;  
By God, we owen fourty pound for stones!

Now help, Thomas, for him that harwed helle!  
For elles moste we our bokes selle.”

And if ye laymen lack our hye instruction,  
Than wol the worlde go al to destruccion.  
For who so wolden us lawe and lyvynge chide,  
So help me Crist, by thy leve, Thomas, I wide,  
He shal han robbed al the world of the sonne.  
For who can teche and do as we han donne?  
And that is nat been for litel tyme, quod he;  
Elyas and Eliseus weren us ylike, ye see,  
And beggers eke, to God be thank and praie!

Now Thomas, help for holy charitee!”  
And doun he caughte him, knelyng on his knee.  
This syke man he wente nigh mad for ire;  
He wolde han had that frere set on fire  
For the hypocrisie that he had shewed.

“Such thynges as I posesse and been myne owne,”  
Seith he, “those may I yeve yow and no moone.  
Ye seyn me that I am as youre owne brother?”  
“Yea, truly,” seide the frere, “trust me ther;  
I yaf thy wyf a lettre with our seel.”  
“That is wel,” quod he, “and sone wol I yeve  
Unto youre holy covent while I lyve,  
And right anon ye shul have it in youre hond,  
On this condicioun only, understonde,  
That ye divide it so, my dere brother,  
That ech frere have al that other hath other.  
This shal ye swere upon the feith ye holde,  
And with-outen fraude or cavill be it tolde.”

“I swere it,” seide this frere, “by my feith!”  
And on the syke man his hond he laide therwith.  
“Lo, hereth my oth! In me shal no treuthe fail.”

“Now thanne, come put thy hond right doun my bak,”  
Replied this man, “and grop thee wel behind;  
For under my buttocks shal thee fynde  
A thyng that I have hid in pryvee.”

“Ah,” thoghte the frere, “this shal go with me!”  
And doun he thrust his hond right to the klete,  
In hope that he sholde fynde somme good gye,  
And whan the syke man felt the frere here  
Groping aboute his hele and al his rere,  
Into his hond he lat the frere a fart.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE SUMMONER’S TALE

    There is no stallion-drawing loaded cart
    That might have let a fart of such a sound.

    The friar leaped up as with wild lion’s bound:
    “Ah, treacherous churl,” he cried, “by God’s own bones,
    I’ll see that he who scorns me thus atones;
    You’ll suffer for this fart — I’ll find a way!”
    The servants, who had heard all this affray,
    Came leaping in and chased the friar out;
    And forth he scowling went, with angry shout,
    And found his fellow, where he’d left his store.
    He glared about as he were some wild boar;
    He ground and gnashed his teeth, so wroth was he.
    He quickly sought the manor, there to see
    The lord thereof, whose honour was the best,
    And always to the friar he confessed;
    This worthy man was lord of that village.
    The friar came, as he were in a rage,
    Where sat the lord at dinner at his board.

    “And if ye lakke our predicacioun,
    Than gooth the world al to destruccioun.
    For who-so wolde us fro this world bireve,
    So god me save, Thomas, by your leve,
    He wolde bireve out of this world the sonne.
    For who can teche and werchen as we conne?
    And that is nat of litel tyme,” quod he;
    “But sith that Elie was, or Elisee,
    Han freres been, that finde I of record,
    In charitee, y-thanked be our lord.
    Now Thomas, help, for seinte Charitee!”
    And doun anon he sette him on his knee.

    This syke man wex wel ny wood for ire;
    He wolde that the frere had been on-fire
    With his false dissimulacioun.
    “Swich thing as is in my possessioun,”
    Quod he, “that may I yeven, and non other.
    Ye sey me thus, how that I am your brother?”
    “Ye, certes,” quod the frere, “trusteth weel;
    I took our dame our lettre with our seel.”
    “Now wel,” quod he, “and som-what shal I yive
    Un-to your holy covent whyl I live,
    And in thyn hand thou shalt it have anoon;
    On this condicioun, and other noon,
    That thou departe it so, my dere brother,
    That every frere have also muche as other.
    This shaltou swere on thy professioun,
    With-outen fraude or cavillacioun.”
    “I swere it,” quod this frere, “upon my feith!”
    And ther-with-all his hand in his he leith:
    “Lo, heer my feith! in me shal be no lak.”
    “Now thanne, put thyn hand doun by my bak,”
    Seyde this man, “and grope wel bihinde;
    Bynethe my buttok ther shaltow finde
    A thing that I have hid in privetee.”
    “A!” thoghte this frere, “this shal go with me!”
    And doun his hand he launcheth to the clifte
    In hope for to finde ther a yifte.

    And whan this syke man felte this frere
    Aboute his twelue grope there and here,
    Amidde his hand he leet the frere a fart.
    Ther nis no capul, drawinge in a cart,
    That mighte have lete a fart of swich a soun.
    The frere up stirte as doth a wood leoun:
    “A! false cherl,” quod he, “for goddes bones,
    This hastow for despit doon, for the nones!
    Thou shalt abye this fart, if that I may!”
    His meynee, whiche that herden this affray,
    Cam leping in, and chaced out the frere;
    And forth he gooth, with a ful angry chere,
    And fette his felawe, ther-as lay his stoor.
    He looked as it were a wilde boor;
    He grinte with his teeth, so was he wrooth.
    A sturdy pas doun to the court he gooth,
    Wher-as ther woned a man of greet honour,
    To whom that he was alwey confessour;
    This worthy man was lord of that village.
    This frere cam, as he were in a rage,
    Wher-as this lord sat eting at his bord.

    Unnethes mighte the frere speke a word.
    Til atte laste he seyde: “God yow see!”
    This lord gan loke, and seide, “Ben’ cite!
    What, frere John, what maner world is this?
    I see wel that som thing ther is amis.
    Ye loken as the wode were ful of thevis,
    Sit doun anon, and tel me what your greef is,
    And it shal been amended, if I may.”
    “I have,” quod he, “had a despyt this day,
    God yelde yow! adoun in your village,
    That in this world is noon so povre a page
    That he nolde have abhomynacioun
    Of that I have receyved in your toun.
    And yet ne greveth me no-thing so sore,
    As that this olde cherl, with lokkes hore,
    Blasphemed hath our holy covent eke.”
    “Now, maister,” quod this lord, “I yow biseke.”
    “No maister, sire,” quod he, “but servitour,
    Thogh I have had in scole swich honour.
    God lyketh nat that ‘Raby’ men us calle,
    Neither in market ne in your large halle.”
    “No fors,” quod he, “but tel me al your grief.”
    “Sire,” quod this frere, “an odious meschief
    This day bitid is to myn ordre and me,
    And so per consequens to ech degree
    Of holy chirche, God amende it sone!”

    “Sir,” quod the lord, “ye woot what is to done.
    Distempre yow noght, ye be my confessour;
    Ye been the salt of the erthe and the savour.
    For goddes love your pacience ye holde;
    Tel me your grief”: and he anon him tolde,
    As ye han herd bifom, ye woot wel what.
    The lady of the hous ay stille sat,
    Til she had herd al what the frere sayde:
    “Ey, goddes moder,” quod she, “blisful mayde!
    Is ther oght elles? telle me feithfully.”
    “Madame,” quod he, “how thinketh yow herby?”
    “How that me thinketh?” quod she; “so god me speede,
    I seye, a cherl hath doon a cherles dede.
    What shold I seye? God lat him never thee!
    His syke heed is ful of vanitee,
    I hold him in a maner frenesye.”
    “Madame,” quod he, “by God I shal nat lye;
    But I on other weyes may be wreke,
    I shal diffame him over-al ther I speke,
    This false blasphemour, that charged me
    To parte that wol nat departed be,
    To every man y-liche, with meschaunce!”
    The lord sat stille as he were in a traunce.
    And in his herte he rolled up and doun,
    “How hadde this cherl imaginacioun
    To shewe swich a probleme to the frere?
    Never erst er now herde I of swich matere;
    I trowe the devel putte it in his minde.
    In ars-metryke shal ther no man finde,
    Bifom this day, of swich a questioun.
    Who sholde make a demonstracioun,
    That every man sholde have y-liche his part
    As of the soun or savour of a fart?

    O scrupulous proud churl, beshrew his face!
    Lo, sirs,” this lord said then, with hard grimace,
    “Who ever heard of such a riling ere now?
    To every man alike? But tell me how!
    Why it's impossible, it cannot be!
    Exacting churl, God give him never glee!
    The rumbling of a fart, and every sound,
    Is but the air’s reverberation round,
    And ever it wastes, by little and little, away.
    There is no man can judge, aye, by my fay,
    Whether it were departed equally.
    Behold, my churl! And yet how cursedly
    To my confessour has he made this crack!
    I hold him surely a demoniac!
    Now eat your meat and let the churl go play,
    Let him go hang himself, the devil’s way!”

    Now the lord’s squire stood ready near the board
    To carve his meat, and he heard, word for word,
    All of the things that I to you have said.
    “My lord,” said he, “be not ill pleased indeed;
    For I could tell, for cloth to make a gown,
    To you, sir friar, so you do not frown,
    How this said fart evenly doled could be
    Among your fellows, if the thing pleased me.”
    “Tell,” said the lord, “and you shall have anon
    Cloth for a gown, by God and by Saint John!”
    “My lord,” said he, “when next the weather’s fair,
    And there’s no wind to stir the quiet air,
    Let someone bring a cartwheel to this hall,
    But see there are no missing spokes at all.
    Twelve spokes a cartwheel has, sir, commonly.
    And bring me then twelve friars, and know you why?
    Because a convent’s thirteen, as I guess.
    The present confessor, for his worthiness,
    He shall complete the tale of this convent.
    Then shall they all kneel down, by one assent,
    And at each spoke’s end, in this manner, sire,
    Let the nose be laid firmly of a friar.
    Your noble sir confessor, whom God save,
    Shall hold his nose upright beneath the nave.
    Then shall this churl, with belly stiff and taut
    As any tabour— let him here be brought;
    And set him on the wheel of this same cart,
    Upon the hub, and make him let a fart.
    And you shall see, on peril of my life,
    With proof so clear that there shall be no strife,
    That equally the sound of it will wend,
    And the stink too, to each spoke’s utter end;
    Save that this worthy man, your confessor,
    Because he is a man of great honour,
    Shall have first fruits, as reasonable it is;
    The noble custom of all friars is this,
    The worthy men of them shall be first served;
    And certainly this has he well deserved.
    He has today taught us so much of good,
    With preaching in the pulpit where he stood,
    That for my part I gladly should agree,
    He might well have the first smell of farts three,
    And so would all his convent, generously,
    He bears himself so well and holily.”

    The lord, the lady, and each man, save the friar,
    Said that Jenkin spak, in this matere,
    As well as Euclide or as Ptholomee.
    Touching the churl, they said, subtiltee
    And heigh wit made him speken as he spak;
    He nis no fool, ne no demoniak.
    And Jenkin hath y-wonne a newe gowne. —
    My tale is doon, we been almost at toune.

    The lord, the lady, and each man, save the friar,
    Agreed that Jenkin spoke, as classifier,
    As well as Euclid or as Ptolemy.
    Touching the churl, they said that subtilty
    And great wit taught him how to make his crack.
    He was no fool, nor a demoniac.
    And Jenkin by this means has won a gown.
    My tale is done, we’re almost into town.

    HERE ENDETH THE SUMMONER’S TALE

## THE CLERK’S PROLOGUE

    “Sir clerk of Oxenford,” our hoste sayde,
    “Ye ryde as coy and stille as dooth a mayde.
    Were newe spoused, sitting at the bord;
    This day ne herde I of your tonge a word.
    I trowe ye studie aboute som sophyme,
    But Salomon seith, ‘everything hath tyme.’
    For goddes sake, as beth of bettre chere.
    It is no tyme for to studien here.
    Telle us som mery tale, by your fey;
    For what man that is entred in a pley,
    He nedes moot unto the pley assente.
    But precheth nat, as freres doon in Lente,
    To make us for our olde sinnes wepe,
    Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe.
    Telle us som mery thing of aventures; —
    Your termes, your colours, and your figures,
    Kepe hem in stoor til so be ye endyte
    Heigh style, as whan that men to kinges write.
    Speketh so pleyn at this tyme, I yow preye,
    That we may understonde what ye seye.”

    This worthy clerk benignely answerde,
    “Hoste,” quod he, “I am under your yerde;
    Ye han of us as now the governaunce.
    And therfor wol I do yow obeisaunce.
    As fer as reson axeth, hardily.
    I wol yow telle a tale which that I
    Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk,
    As preved by his wordes and his werk.
    He is now deed and nayled in his cheste,
    I prey to God so yeve his soule reste!
    Fraunceys Petrark, the laureat poete,
    Highte this clerk, whos rethoryke sweete
    Enlumined al Itaille of poetrye,
    As Linian dide of philosophye
    Or lawe, or other art particuler;
    But deeth, that wol nat suffre us dwellen heer
    But as it were a twinkling of an y,—
    Hem bothe hath slayn, and alle shul we dyg.
    But forth to tellen of this worthy man,
    That taughte me this tale, as I bigan,
    I seye that first with heigh style he endyteth,
    Er he the body of his tale wryteth,
    A proheme, in the which discryveth he
    Pemond, and of Saluces the contree,
    And speketh of Apennyn, the hilles hye,
    That been the boundes of West Lumbardye,
    And of Mount Vesulus in special,
    Where as the Po, out of a welle smal,
    Taketh his firste springing and his sours,
    That estward ay encresseth in his cours
    To Emelward, to Ferrare, and Venyse:
    The which a long thing were to devyse.
    And trewely, as to my jugement,
    Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,
    Save that he wol conveyen his matere:
    But this his tale, which that ye may here.”

## THE CLERK’S TALE

HERE BEGINNETH THE TALE OF THE CLERK OF OXFORD

    Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille,
    Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde,
    A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
    Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,
    That founded were in tyme of fadres olde.
    And many another delitable sighte,
    And Saluces this noble contree highte.

    A markis whylom lord was of that londe,
    As were his worthy eldres him bifore;
    And obeisant and redy to his honde
    Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and more.
    Thus in delyt he liveth, and hath don yore,
    Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of fortune,
    Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.

    Therwith he was, to speke as of linage,
    The gentilleste y-born of Lumbardye,
    A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,
    And ful of honour and of curteisye;
    Discreet y-nogh his contree for to gye,
    Save in somme thinges that he was to blame.
    And Walter was this yonge lordes name.

    I blame him thus, that he considereth noght
    In tyme cominge what mighte him bityde,
    But on his lust present was al his thoght,
    As for to hauke and hunte on every syde;
    Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde,
    And eek he nolde, and that was worst of alle,
    Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.

    Only that point his peple bar so sore,
    That flokmele on a day they to him wente.
    And oon of hem, that wysest was of lore,
    Or elles that the lord best wolde assente
    That he sholde telle him what his peple mente,
    Or elles coude he shewe wel swich matere,
    He to the markis seyde as ye shul here.

    “O noble markis, your humanitee
    Assureth us and yeveth us hardinesse,
    As ofte as time is of necessitee
    That we to yow mowe telle our hevinesse.
    Accepteth, lord, now for your gentillesse,
    That we with pitous herte un-to yow pleyne,
    And lete your eres nat my voys disdeyne.

    “Al have I noght to done in this matere
    More than another man hath in this place,
    Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so dere,
    Han alwey shewed me favour and grace,
    I dar the better aske of yow a space
    Of audience, to shewen our requeste,
    And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.

    “For certes, lord, so wel us lyketh yow
    And al your werk and ever han doon, that we
    Ne coude nat us self devysen how
    We mighte liven in more felicitee.
    Save o thing, lord, if it your wille be,
    That for to been a wedded man yow leste.
    Than were your peple in sovereyn hertes reste.
    Boweth your nekke under that blisful yok
    Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse,
    Which that men clepeth spousaille or wedlok;
    And thenketh, lord, among your thoghtes wyse,
    How that our dayes passe in sondry wyse;
    For though we slepe or wake, or rome, or ryde,
    Ay fleeth the tyme, it nil no man abyde.
    And though your grene youthe floure as yit,
    In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,
    And deeth manaceth every age, and smit
    In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon:
    And al so certein as we knowe echoon
    That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle
    Been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle.

    “Accepteth than of us the trewe entente,
    That never yet refuseden your heste.
    And we wol, lord, if that ye wol assente,
    Chese yow a wyf in short tyme, atte leste,
    Born of the gentilleste and of the meste
    Of al this lond, so that it oghte seme
    Honour to god and yow, as we can deme.
    Deliver us out of al this bisy drede,
    And tak a wyf, for hye goddes sake;
    For if it so bifelle, as god forbede,
    That thurgh your deeth your linage sholde slake,
    And that a straunge successour sholde take
    Your heritage, o! wo were us alyve!
    Wherfor we pray yow hastily to wyve.”

    Hir meke preyere and hir pitous chere
    Made the markis herte han pitee.
    “Ye wol,” quod he, “myne owene peple dere,
    To that I never erst thoghte streyne me.
    I me rejoysed of my libertee,
    That selde tyme is founde in mariage;
    Ther I was free, I moot be in servage.
    But nathelees I see your trewe entente,
    And truste upon your wit, and have don ay;

    “Though I have naught to do in this matter
    More than another man has in this place,
    Yet for as much as you, most honoured sir,
    I have always showed me your favour and grace,
    I dare the more to ask of you a space
    Of audience, to set forth our request;
    And you, my lord, will do as you think best.

    “For certes, lord, so well us liketh you
    And all your works, and ever have done so,
    We could not of ourselves well knowe
    What should increase our bliss or make us low.
    Save one thing, lord, if it be to your mind,
    That to be married you should now consent.
    Then were your people’s hearts at peace defined.

    “Bow down your neck under that blissful yoke
    Of sovereignty, not harsh and heavy service,
    Which men call espousal or wedlock’s yoke.
    Think, lord, how quickly slip our days and hours:
    Time flies, whether we wake or sleep or ride;
    Age creeps upon us silent as a stone,
    And Death with equal hand strikes every side.
    Accept then of us this our true intent,
    That never yet refused your high behest;
    And we will, lord, if that ye so assent,
    Choose you a wife soon, born of noblest blood,
    So that it honour God and you, we trust.
    Deliver us from this besetting dread,
    And take a wife, for God’s sake do not stay;
    For if it be, as God forbid, men said,
    Through your death your lineage should decay,
    And that a strange successor should take
    Your heritage, — woe were it unto us!
    Wherefore we pray you speedily to wive.”

    Their humble prayers and their pitiful faces
    Had moved the marquis’ heart unto pity.
    “Ye would,” quoth he, “my own people dear,
    Do that I never yet had thought to do.
    I have rejoiced in my liberty,
    That rarely men do find in marriage;
    Where I was free, I must be now in thrall.
    Yet nevertheless I see your true intent,
    And trust upon your wit, and have done aye;
    I will not wholly from your counsel fly.

    (The tale continues.)

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

Wherefore of my free will will I consent  
To wed a wife, as soon as ever I may.

But whereas ye have offered here today  
To choose a wife for me, I you release  
From that, and pray that you thereof will cease.

Wherfor of my free wil I wol assente  
To wedde me, as sone as ever I may.

But ther-as ye han profred me to-day  
To chese me a wif, I yow relesse  
That choys, and prey yow of that profre cesse.

“For God knows well that children oft retain  
Naught of their worthy elders gone before;  
Goodness comes all from God, not of the strain  
Whereof they were engendered; furthermore  
I trust in God’s great goodness, and therefore  
My marriage and my state and all my case  
I leave to Him to do with as He please.

“Let me alone in choosing of my wife,  
That burden on my own back I’ll endure;  
But I pray you, and charge you on your life,  
That what wife I may take, me you’ll assure  
You’ll honour her throughout her life’s tenure,  
In word and deed, both here and everywhere,  
As if she were an emperor’s daughter fair.

“And furthermore, this shall you swear, that you  
Against my choice shall neither grouse nor strive;  
Since I’m forgoing liberty, and woo  
At your request, so may I ever thrive  
As, where my heart is set, there will I wive;  
And save you give consent in such manner,  
I pray you speak no more of this matter.”

For God it woot, that children ofte been  
Unlyk her worthy eldres hem bifore;

Bountee comth al of God, nat of the streen  
Of which they been engendred and y-bore;

I truste in Goddes bountee, and therefore  
My mariage and myn estat and reste  
I him bitake; he may don as him leste.

Lat me alone in chesinge of my wif,  
That charge upon my bak I wol endure;

But I yow preye, and charge upon your lyf,  
That what wif that I take, ye me assure  
To worshipe hir, whyl that hir lyf may dure,  
In word and werk, bothe here and everywhere,  
As she an emperoures doghter were.

And forthermore, this shal ye swere, that ye  
Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve;  
For sith I shal forgoon my libertee  
At your requeste, as ever moot I thryve,  
Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve;

And but ye wole assente in swich manere,  
I prey yow, speketh na-more of this matere.

With hearty will they swore and gave assent  
To all this, and no one of them said nay;  
Praying him of his grace, before they went,  
That he would set for them a certain day  
For his espousal, soon as might be; yea,  
For still the people had a little dread  
Lest that the marquis would no woman wed.

With hertly wil they sworen, and assenten  
To al this thing, ther seyde no wight nay;  
Bisekinge him of grace, er that they wenten,  
That he wolde graunten hem a certein day  
Of his spousaille, as sone as ever he may;  
For yet alwey the peple som-what dredde  
Lest that this markis no wyf wolde wedde.

He granted them the day that pleased him best  
Whereon he would be married, certainly,  
And said he did all this at their request;  
And they with humble hearts, obediently,  
Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,  
All thanked him there, and thus they made an end  
Of their design and homeward did they wend.

He graunted hem a day, swich as him leste,  
On which he wolde be wedded sikirly,  
And seyde, he dide al this at hir requeste;  
And they, with humble entente, buxomly,  
Knelinge up-on her knees ful reverently  
Him thanken alle, and thus they han an ende  
Of hir entente, and hoom agayn they wende.

And thereupon he to his officers  
Ordered that for the fete they should provide,  
And to his household gentlemen and squires  
Such charges gave as pleased him to decide;  
And all obeyed him; let him praise or chide,  
And each of them did all his diligence  
To show unto the fete his reverence.

And heer-up-on he to his officeres  
Comaundeth for the feste to purveye,  
And to his privee knightes and squyeres  
Swich charge yaf, as him liste on hem leye;  
And they to his comandement obeye,  
And ech of hem doth al his diligence  
To doon unto the feste reverence.

THE FIRST PART

HERE ENDETH

HERE BEGINNETH THE SECOND PART

Not far from that same honoured palace where  
This marquis planned his marriage, at this tide,  
There stood a hamlet, on a site most fair,  
Wherein the poor folk of the countryside  
Stabled their cattle and did all abide,  
And of their labour took their sustenance  
After that the earth had yielded abundance.

Noght fer fro thilke paleys honorable  
Ther-as this markis shoop his mariage,  
Ther stood a throp, of site delitable,  
In which that povre folk of that village  
Hadden hir bestes and hir herbergage,  
And of hir labour took hir sustenance  
After that th’erthe yaf hem habundance.

Amongst these humble folk there dwelt a man  
Who was considered poorest of them all;  
But the High God of Heaven sometimes can  
Send His grace to a little ox’s stall;  
Janicula men of that throp him calle.  
A daughter had he, fair enough to sight;  
Griselda was this young maid’s name, the bright.

A doghter hadde he, fair y-nogh to sighte,  
And Grisildis this yonge mayden highte.

But if one should speak of virtuous beauty,  
Then was she of the fairest under sun;  
Since fostered in dire poverty was she,  
No luxurious lust ran through her heart;  
More often from the well than from the tun  
She drank, and since she would chaste virtue please,  
She knew well labour, but not idle ease.

But though this maiden tender was of age,  
Yet in the breast of her virginity  
There was enclosed ripe and sober courage;  
And in great reverence and charity  
Her poor old father she did ever cherish;  
A few sheep grazing on the field she kept,  
She would not be idle till she slept.

And when she homeward came, she would oft bring  
Roots and other herbs, full many a time,  
Which she would shred and seethe for her living,  
And made her bed full hard and none too soft;  
And ever she kept her father’s life aloft  
With every obedience and diligence  
That child may do to father’s reverence.

Up-on Griselda, this poor creature,  
Full often sith the marquis set his eye  
As he upon his hunting rode, perchance;  
And when it chanced that he might her espy,  
Not with wanton lookings of folly  
His eyes he cast upon her, but in sober wise  
Upon her cheer he would him oft advise,  
Commending in his heart her womanhood  
And eke her virtue, passing every wight  
Of so young age, as well in cheer as deed.

For though the people have no great insight  
In virtue, he considered full aright  
Her goodness, and disposed that he would  
Wed only her, if ever wed he should.

The day of wedding came, but no one can  
Tell who the woman is that it should be;  
Whereat many men wondered and said in privacy,  
“Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?  
Will he not wed? Alas, alas, the while!  
Why will he thus himself and us beguile?”  
Nevertheless this marquis hath done make  
Of gemmes, set in gold and in azure,  
Brooches and rings, all for Griselda’s sake,  
And for her garments took he then the measure  
By a young maiden of her form and stature,  
And found all other ornaments as well  
That for such wedding would be meet to tell.

Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,  
Broches and ringes, for Grisildis sake,  
And of hir clothing took he the mesure  
By a mayde, lyk to hir stature,  
And eek of othere ornamentes alle  
That unto swich a wedding sholde falle.

The time of mid-morn of that very day  
Approached when this lord’s marriage was to be;  
And all the palace was bedecked and gay,  
Both hall and chambers, each in its degree;  
With kitchens stuffed with food in great plenty,  
There might one see the last and least dainty  
That could be found in all of Italy.

This regal marquis, splendidly arrayed,  
With lords and ladies in his company  
(Who to attend the feasting had been prayed),  
And of his retinue the bachelery,  
With many a sound of sundry melody,  
Unto the village whereof I have told,  
In this array the nearest way did hold.

Griselda who, God knows, was innocent  
That for her sake was all this fine array,  
To fetch some water, to a fountain went;  
Yet she returned soon, this lovely maid,  
For she had heard it said that on that day  
The marquis was to wed, and if she might,  
She was full fain to see the glorious sight.

She thought: “With other maidens I will stand  
(Who are my friends) within our door, and see  
The marchioness; and therefore I’ll turn hand  
To do at home, as soon as it may be,  
The household work that’s waiting there for me;  
And then I’ll be at leisure to behold  
Her, if they this way to the castle hold.”

And as across her threshold she would have gone,  
The marquis came, and for her did he call;  
And she set down her water-jar anon  
Beside the threshold, in an ox’s stall,  
And down upon her two knees did she fall,  
And, kneeling, with grave countenance, was still  
Till she had heard what was his lordship’s will.

This thoughtful marquis spoke unto this maid  
Full soberly, and said in this manner:  
“Griselda, where’s your father?” so he said.  
And she, with reverence and with humble cheer,  
Answered: “My lord, he is but inside here.”  
And in she went without more tarrying  
And to the marquis did her father bring.

He by the hand then took this ancient man  
And said, when he had led him well aside:  
“Janicula, I neither will nor can  
Conceal my love, nor my heart’s longing hide;  
If you but acquiesce, whate’er betide,  
Your daughter will I take, before I wend,  
To be my wife until her life’s dear end.

Thou lovest me, I woot it well, certein,  
And art my feithful lige man y-bore;  
And al that liketh me, I dar wel seyn  
It liketh thee, and specially therfore  
Tel me that poynt that I have seyd bifore.  
If that thou wolt unto that purpos drawe,  
To take me as for thy son-in-law?”

This sudden case this man astonied so  
That red he wax, abaysed, and all quaking  
He stood; unnethe seyde he wordes mo.  
But only thus: “Lord,” quod he, “my willing  
Is as ye wol, ne ayeines your liking  
I wol nothing; ye be my lord so dere;  
Right as yow lust governeth this matere.”

“Ye love me, and I know it well today,  
And are my faithful liege, and were of yore;  
And all that pleases me, I dare well say,  
Pleases you too; especially therefore  
Assure me on the point I made before—  
Can we together in this compact draw,  
And will you take me as your son-in-law?”

This sudden word the man astonished so  
That red he grew, abashed, and all quaking  
He stood; nor could he answer further, no,  
Than but to say: “O Lord, I am willing  
To do your will; but against your liking  
I’ll do no thing; you are my lord so dear  
That what you wish governs this matter here.”

“Yet will I,” said this marquis softly,  
“That in thy chamber I and thou and she  
Have a collacion, and wostow why?  
For I will ask if it be her will to be  
My wife, and rule herself thereafter me;  
And all this shall be done in thy presence,  
I will not speak out of thine audience.”

And in the chamber while they were about  
Their treaties, which as ye shall after hear,  
The people came unto the house without,  
And wondered them in how honest manner  
And tenderly she kept her father dear.  
But outwardly Griselda wondered much,  
For never erst saw she such a sight.

No wonder is though that she were astoned  
To see so great a guest come in that place;  
She never was to such guests wont.  
For which she looked with full pale face.

But shortly forth this tale for to chase,  
These are the words that the marquis said  
To this benign, very faithful maid.

> “Griselda,” he said, “you shall well understand:  
> It pleases your father and myself that I wed you, and so it may stand.  
> As I suppose, you will that it so be.  
> But these demands I ask first,” quoth he,  
> “That, since it shall be done in hastful wise,  
> Will you assent, or otherwise advise?  
> I say this: be you ready with good heart  
> To all my lust, and that I freely may,  
> As me best thinketh, make you laugh or smart,  
> And never you to grudge it, night nor day?  
> And eke when I say ‘ye’ ne say ‘nay,’  
> Neither by word nor frowning countenance;  
> Swear this, and here I swear our alliance.”

Wondring upon this word, quaking for dread,  
She said, “Lord, undigne and unworthy  
Am I to thilke honour that ye me bede;  
But as ye will yourself, right so will I.  
And here I swear that never willingly  
In deed or thought will I you disobey,  
To save my life, and I love life, I say.”

“This is enough, Griselda mine,” cried he.

And forth he went then with full sober cheer  
Out at the door, and after him came she,  
And to the people who were waiting near,  
“This is my wife,” he said, “who’s standing here.  
Honour her, all, and love her, all, I pray,  
Who love me; and there is no more to say.”

And so that nothing of her former gear  
She should take with her to his house, he bade  
That women strip her naked then and there;  
Whereat these ladies were not over-glad  
To handle clothes wherein she had been clad.  
Nevertheless, this maiden bright of hue  
From head to foot they clothed her all anew.

Her hair they combed and brushed, which fell untressed  
All artlessly, and placed a coronal  
With their small fingers on her head, and dressed  
Her robes with many jewels great and small;  
Of her array how shall I tell withal?  
Scarcely the people knew her for fairness,  
So transformed was she in her splendid dress.

This marquis her has married with a ring  
Brought for the purpose there; and then has set  
Upon a horse, snow-white and well ambling,  
And to his palace, without longer let,  
With happy following folk and more they met,  
Conveyed her home, and thus the day they spent  
In revelry until the sun’s descent.

And briefly forth throughout this tale to chase,  
I say that unto this new marchioness  
God has such favour sent her, of His grace,  
It seemed in no way true, by likeliness,  
That she was born and bred in humbleness,  
As in a hovel or an ox’s stall,  
But rather nurtured in an emperor’s hall.

To everyone she soon became so dear  
And worshipful, that folk where she had dwelt  
And from her birth had known her, year by year,  
Although they could have sworn it, scarcely felt  
That to Janicula, with whom I’ve dealt,  
She really was a daughter, for she seemed  
Another creature now, or so they deemed.

For though she ever had been virtuous,  
She was augmented by such excellence  
Of manners based on noble goodness thus,  
And so discreet and wise of eloquence,  
So gentle and so worthy reverence,  
And she could so the people’s hearts embrace,  
That each her loved that looked upon her face.

Not only in Saluzzo, in the town,  
Was published wide the goodness of her name,  
But eke beside in many a region,  
If one said well, another said the same;  
So spread of her high bounty was the fame  
That men and women, as well young as old,  
Went to Saluzzo, her but to behold.

Thus Walter lowly — nay, but royally —  
Wedded with fortunate honesty,  
In God’s peace lived full easily at home,  
And outward grace enough had he;  
And for he saw that under low degree  
Was often virtue hid, the people held  
That he was prudent, and that’s rarely told.

Not only this Griselda through her wit  
Could all the feats of wifely humbleness,  
But eke, when that the case required it,  
The common profit could she well redress.  
There was no discord, rancour, nor heaviness  
In all that land that she could not appease,  
And wisely bring them all to rest and ease.

Though that her husband absent were a-while,  
If gentle men, or others of her country,  
Were wroth, she would bring them at one reconcile;  
So wise and ripe of speech were her apathy,  
And judgements of so great equitee,  
That she seemed sent from Heaven, men thought,  
To save the people and every wrong to right.

Not long time after that this Griselda  
Was wedded, she a daughter had y-bore,  
Al had her lever have borne a knave child.  
Glad was this marquis and the folk therefore;  
For though a maid-child came there all before,  
She may unto a knave child aye attain  
By likelihood, since she was not barren.

It happened, as it befalls in times more,  
When that this child had sucked but a throwe,  
This marquis in his heart longing so  
To tempt his wife, her sadness for to know,  
That he might not out of his heart let go  
This marvellous desire his wife to assay.  
Needless, God woot, he thought her for to affray.

He had assayed her enough before,  
And found her ever good; what needed it  
Her for to tempt and always more and more?  
Though some men praise it for a subtil wit,  
But as for me, I say that evil it sit  
To assay a wife when that it is no need,  
And putten her in anguish and in dread.

For which this marquis wrought in this manner;  
He came alone by night where she did lie,  
With stern face and with full troubled cheer,  
And said thus: “Griselda, that day  
When I removed you out of your poor array  
And placed you in a state of nobleness —  
You have not all forgotten that, I guess.

“I say, Griselda, this your dignity  
Wherein I have so placed you, as I trow,  
Has not made you forgetful now to be”

## HERE FOLLOWETH THE FIFTH PART

Among all this, meanwhile, according to his wicked way,  
This marquis, yet his wife to tempt once more,  
Even to the utterest proof of her courage,  
Fully to have experience and lore.

> “If she were yet as steadfast as before,”

If she were yet as steadfast as before, he on a day in open audience loudly said unto her this rude sentence:

> “Truly, Griselda, I’d much joy, perchance,  
> When you I took for wife, for your goodness  
> And for your truth and your obedience,  
> Not for your lineage nor your wealth, I guess;  
> But now I know, in utter certainness,  
> That in great lordship, if I well advise,  
> There is great servitude in sundry wise.  
> I may not act as every plowman may;  
> My people have constrained me that I take  
> Another wife, and this they ask each day;  
> And now the pope, to slake hot rancour thus,  
> Consents; I dare the thing to undertake;  
> And truly now this much to you I’ll say,  
> My new wife journeys hither on her way.  
> Be strong of heart and leave at once her place,  
> And that same dower that you brought to me,  
> Take it again; I grant it of my grace:  
> ‘Return you to your father’s house,’ said he;  
> ‘No man may always have prosperity;  
> With a calm heart I urge you to endure  
> The stroke of Fortune or of adventure.’”

And she replied again, of her patience:

> “My lord,” said she, “I know, and knew always,  
> How that between your own magnificence  
> And my poor state, no person can or may  
> Make a comparison in an equal way.  
> I never held me worthy or of grade  
> To be your wife, no, nor your chambermaid.  
> And in this house, where lady you made me  
> (The High God, I take now to witness,  
> And as He truly may my soul’s joy be),  
> I never held me lady nor mistress,  
> But only servant to your worthiness;  
> And ever shall, while my life may endure,  
> Beyond all worldly beings, that is sure,  
> That you so long, of your benignity,  
> Have held me here in honour in this way,  
> Where I was never worthy, once, to be.  
> For that, thank God and you — to God I pray  
> He will reward you. There’s no more to say.  
> Unto my father gladly will I wend  
> And dwell with him until my life shall end.  
> Where I was fostered when an infant small,  
> There will I lead my life till I be dead,  
> A widow, clean in body, heart, and all.  
> For since I gave to you my maidenhead,  
> And am your true and lawful wife, wedded,  
> May God forbid such a lord’s wife to take  
> Another man for husband or for love’s sake.  
> And of your new wife, may God of His grace  
> Grant you but joy and all prosperity.  
> For I will gladly yield to her my place,  
> Wherein so happy I was wont to be,  
> For since it pleases you, my lord,” said she,  
> “That which was whilom all my heart’s rest,  
> I shall go — I will go when you request.  
> But whereas you proffer me such dower  
> As I first brought, it is well in my mind  
> It were my wretched clothes, nothing fair,  
> Which to me now were hard to find.  
> O good God! how gentle and how kind  
> Ye seemed by your speech and your visage  
> The day that was our marriage!  
> But truth is said — at least I find it true —  
> For in effect it proved is on me —  
> Love is not old when that it is new.  
> But certes, lord, for no adversity,  
> Though I should die in the case, it shall not be  
> That ever in word or work I shall repent  
> That I you gave my heart in whole intent.  
> My lord, you know that, in my father’s place,  
> You did me strip out of my poor weed,  
> And richly clothe me of your grace.  
> To you I brought nothing else, out of dread,  
> But faith and nakedness and maidenhead.  
> And here again my clothing I restore,  
> And eke my wedding-ring, for evermore.  
> The remnant of your jewels ready be  
> Within your chamber, dare I safely say;  
> Naked out of my father’s house,” said she,  
> “I came, and naked must I turn again.  
> All your pleasure will I follow fain;  
> But yet I hope it be not your intent  
> That I smockless out of your palace went.  
> Ye could not do so dishonourable a thing,  
> That that same womb in which your children lie  
> Should, before the people, in my walking,  
> Be seen all bare; wherefore I you pray,  
> Let me not like a worm go by the way.  
> Remember you, my own lord so dear,  
> I was your wife, though I unworthy were.  
> Wherefore, in guerdon of my maidenhead  
> Which that I brought, and not again I bear,  
> As you vouchsafe to give me to my meed,  
> Let them but give me such a smock as I was wont to wear,  
> That I therewith may hide the womb of her  
> That was your wife; and here I take my leave  
> Of you, my own lord, lest I you grieve.””

“The smock,” said he, “that thou hast on thy back,  
Let it be still, and bear it forth with thee.”

But well unnetheless that word he spake, and went his way for ruth and for pity. Before the folk herself she stripped, and in her smock, with head and feet all bare, toward her father’s house forth went she.

The folk they followed, weeping and with cries, and Fortune did they curse as they passed on; but she with weeping wet not her eyes, and all this while of words she said not one. Her father, who had heard this news anon, cursed then the day and hour when nature shaped him to be a living creature.

For beyond any doubt this poor old man had always feared the marquis soon would tire, and doubted since the marriage first began, if when the lord had satisfied desire, he would not think a wife of station higher, for one of his degree had been more right, and send her thence as soon as ever he might. To meet his daughter hastily went he, for he, by noise of folk, knew her coming; and with her old coat, such as it might be, he covered her, full sorrowfully weeping; but the coat over her he could not bring, for poor the cloth, and many days had passed since on her marriage day she wore it last.

Thus with her father, for a certain space, did dwell this flower of wifely meek patience, who neither by her words nor in her face, before the people nor in their absence, showed that she thought to her was done offence; nor of her high estate a remembrance had she, to judge by her calm countenance.

No wonder, though, for while in high estate her soul kept ever full humility; no mouth complaining, no heart delicate, no pomp, no look of haughty royalty, but full of patience and benignity, discreet and prideless, always honourable, and to her husband meek and firm as well.

Men speak of Job and of his humbleness, as clerks, when they so please, right well can write concerning men; but truth is, nevertheless, though clerks’ praise of all women is but slight, no man acquits himself in meekness quite as women can, nor can be half so true as women are, save this be something new.

Now from Bologna is this lord of Panago come, whereof the word spread unto great and less, and in the ears of people all and some it was told, too, that a new marchioness came with him in such pomp and such richness that never had been seen with human eye so noble array in all West Lombardy. The marquis, who had planned and knew all this before this count was come, sent a message to poor Griselda, who had lost her bliss; and she with humble heart and glad visage, not with any swollen thought in her courage, came at his behest and on her knees she set her, and reverently and wisely she him greeted.

“Griselda,” said he, “my will is outwardly: this maiden that shall be wedded to me, received be to-morrow as royally as it is possible in my house to be; and eke that every wight in his degree have his estate in sitting and service and high pleasure, as I can best devise. I have no women sufficient certain the chambers for to array in ordinance after my lust, and therefore would I fain that thine were all such manner governance; thou knowest eke of old all my pleasure; though thy array be bad and ill beset, do thou thy devoir at the leastwise.”

“Not only, lord, that I am glad,” said she, “to do your lust, but I desire also to serve you and please in my degree without fainting, and shall evermore. Never, for no weal nor no woe, shall the ghost within my heart stent to love you best with all my true entent.”

And with that word she began the house to dight, and tables for to set and beds to make; and she laboured to do all that she might, praying the chamberers, for God’s sake, to hasten them and to fast sweep and shake; and she, the most serviceable of all, hath every chamber arrayed and his hall. About mid-morning then this count alit, who with him brought these noble children twain; for which the people ran to see the sight of their array, so richly beset; and then at first among them they say that Walter was no fool, though that him leste to change his wife, for it was for the best. For she is fairer, as they deem all, than is Griselda, and more tender of age, and fairer fruit between them should fall, and more pleasant for her high lineage; her brother eke so fair was of visage, that them to see the people took pleasure, commending now the marquis’ governance.

“O stormy people! unsafe and ever untrue! Aye undiscreet and changing as a vane, delighting ever in rumour that is new; for like the moon aye do you wax and wane; full of clapping, dear enough a Jane; your doom is false, your constancy ill proveth; a full great fool is he that on you leaveth!” Thus said the sober folk in that city.

Seeing the people staring up and down, for they were glad, right for the novelty, to have a young new lady of their town, — no more of this I’ll mention or make known; but to Griselda I’ll myself address and tell her constancy and her business.

Full busy Griselda was in everything that to the marquis’ feast was pertinent; nothing was she confused by her clothing, though rude it was and somewhat rent. But with a glad face to the gate she went, with other folk, to greet the marchioness, and afterward she did her business.

With so glad face his guests she did receive, and with such tact each one in his degree, that no fault in it could a man perceive; but all they wondered much who she might be that in so poor array, as they could see, yet knew so much of rank and reverence; and worthily they praised her high prudence. In all this while she never once did cease the maiden and her brother to commend with kindness of a heart that was at peace, so well that no man could her praise amend. But at the last, when all these lords did wend to seat themselves to dine, then did he call Griselda, who was busy in his hall.

“Griselda,” said he, as it were in play, “how like you my new wife and her beauty?”

“Right well,” said she, “my lord; for, faith, a fairer saw I never than is she. I pray that God give her prosperity; and so I hope that to you both He’ll send great happiness until your lives shall end.

“One thing I beg my lord, and warn also, that you prick not, with any tormenting, this tender maid, as you’ve hurt others so; for she’s been nurtured in her up-bringing more tenderly, and, to my own thinking, she could not such adversity endure as could one reared in circumstances poor.”

And when this Walter thought of her patience, her glad face with no malice at all, and how so oft he’d done to her offence, and she aye firm and constant as a wall, remaining ever blameless through it all, this cruel marquis did his heart address to pity for her wifely steadfastness.

> “This is enough, Griselda mine,” cried he,  
> “Be now no more ill pleased nor more afraid;  
> I have your faith and your benignity,  
> As straitly as ever woman’s was, assayed,  
> In great estate and poor arrayed.  
> Now know I, dear wife, thy steadfastness,” —  
> And thereupon he took her in his arms and began to kiss her.

And she for wonder took of it no keep; she heard not what thing he to her said; she fared as she had started out of a sleep till she out of her masedness abraid. “Griselda,” said he, “by God that for us died, thou art my wife, ne none other I have, nor never had, as God my soul save! This is thy daughter which thou hast supposed to be my wife; that other faithfully shall be my heir, as I have aye purposed; thou bare him in thy body truly. At Bologna have I kept them privily; take them again, for now mayst thou not say that thou hast lost none of thy children twain. And folk that otherwise have said of me, I warn them well that I have done this deed neither for malice nor for cruelty, but for to assay in thee thy womanhood; and not to slay my children, God forbid! But for to keep them privily and still till I thy purpose knew and all thy will.”

When she this heard, aswoon down she falleth for pitiful joy, and after her swooning both her young children unto her calleth, and in her arms, piteously weeping, embraceth them and tenderly kissing. Full like a mother, with her salt tears she bathed both their visage and their hairs. O, what a piteous thing it was to see her swooning, and her humble voice to hear! “Gramercy, lord, that thank I you,” said she, “that ye have saved to me my children dear! Now recks me never to be dead right here; since I stand in your love and in your grace, no force of death, nor when my spirit pace! O tender, O dear, O young children mine, your woeful mother thought steadfastly that cruel hounds or some foul vermin had eaten you; but God, of His mercy, and your benign father tenderly hath done you kept”; and in that same stound suddenly she swooped down to the ground.

And in her swoon so sadly held she her children two, when she began them to embrace, that with great sleight and great difficulty the children from her arm they gan to arace. O many a tear on many a piteous face down ran of them that stood her beside; unnethe about her might they abide.

Suddenly there she fell upon the ground.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE CLERK'S TALE

And in her swoon so forcefully held she  
Her children two, whom she’d had in embrace,  
That it was hard from her to set them free,  
Her arms about them gently to unlace.

Oh, many a tear on many a pitying face  
Ran down, of those who stood there by her side;  
Scarce, for sympathy, could they their griefs hide.

But Walter cheered her till her sorrow slackened;  
And she rose up, abashed, out of her trance;  
All praised her now, and joyous words they fashioned,  
Till she regained her wonted countenance.  
Walter so honoured her by word and glance  
That it was pleasing to observe the cheer  
Between them, now again together here.

*Middle English* (8983–9036)

Walter hir gladeth, and hir sorwe slaketh;  
She ryseth up, abaysed, from hir traunce.  
And every wight hir joye and feste maketh,  
Til she hath caught agayn hir contenaunce.  
Walter hir dooth so feithfully plesaunce,  
That it was deyntee for to seen the chere  
Bitwixe hem two, now they ben met y-fere.

These ladies, when they found a tactful way,  
Withdrew her and to her own chamber went,  
And stripped her out of her so rude array,  
And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,  
Crowned with a crown of many a precious stone  
Upon her head, once more to hall they brought  
Her, where they honoured her as all they ought.

*Middle English*

Thise ladyes, whan that they hir tyme say,  
Han taken hir, and in-to chambre goon.  
And strepen hir out of hir rude array,  
And in a cloth of gold that brighte shoon.  
With a coroun of many a riche stoon  
Up-on hir heed, they in-to halle hir broghte,  
And ther she was honoured, as hir oghte.

Thus had this heavy day a happy end,  
For everyone did everything he might  
The day in mirth and revelry to spend  
Till in the heavens shone the stars’ fair light.  
For far more grand in every person’s sight  
This feast was, and of greater cost, ’twas said,  
Than were the revels when they two were wed.

*Middle English*

Thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende,  
For every man and womman dooth his might  
This day in murthe and revel to dispende  
Til on the welkne shoon the sterres light.  
For more solempne in every mannes sight  
This feste was, and gretter of costage,  
Than was the revel of hir mariage.

Full many a year in high prosperity  
They lived, these two, in harmony and rest,  
And splendidly his daughter married he  
Unto a lord, one of the worthiest  
In Italy; and then in peace, as best  
His wife’s old father at his court he kept  
Until the soul out of his body crept.

*Middle English*

Ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee  
Liven thise two in concord and in reste,  
And richely his doghter maried he  
Un-to a lord, oon of the worthieste  
Of al Itaille; and than in pees and reste  
His wyves fader in his court he kepeth,  
Til that the soule out of his body crepeth.

His son succeeded to his heritage  
In rest and peace, after the marquis’ day,  
And wedded happily at proper age,  
Albeit he tried his wife not, so they say.  
This world is not so harsh, deny who may,  
As in old times that now are long since gone;  
And hearken what this author says thereon.

This story’s told here, not that all wives should  
Follow Griselda in humility, — for this  
Would be unbearable, though some would, —  
But simply that all folk, in their degree,  
Should be as constant in adversity  
As was Griselda; for that Petrarch wrote  
This tale, and in a high style, as you’ll note.

For since a woman once was so patient  
Before a mortal man, well more we ought  
Receive in good part that which God has sent;  
For cause He has to prove what He has wrought.  
But He tempts no man that His blood hath bought,  
As Saint James says, if you his epistle read;  
Yet does He prove folk at all times, indeed,

And suffers us, for our good exercise,  
With the sharp scourges of adversity  
To be well beaten oft, in sundry wise;  
Not just to learn our will; for truly He,  
Ere we were born, did all our frailty see;  
And for our best is all His governance;  
Let us then live in virtuous sufferance.

*Middle English* (9037–9077)

And suffre us, as for our excercyse,  
With sharpe scourges of adversitee,  
Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wyse;  
Nat for to knowe our wil, for certes he,  
Er we were born, knew al our freletee;  
And for our beste is al his governaunce;  
Lat us than live in vertuous suffraunce.

But one word, lordinges, hearken ere I go: —  
It were full hard to find in all these days  
In all a town Griseldas three or two;  
For, if that they were put to such assays,  
The gold of them hath now so bad an alway  
With brass, that though the coin be fair to eye,  
It would rather burst in two than bend, say I.

For which, here, for the wives’ love of Bath,  
Whose life and all her sect God may maintain  
In high mastery, and else were it but scathe,  
I will with lusty heart, fresh and green,  
Sing you a song to gladden you, I ween.  
And let us stint of earnestful matter: —  
Hearken my song, that runs in this manner.

*Middle English*

But one word, masters, hearken ere I go:  
One hardly can discover nowadays,  
In all a town, Griseldas three or two;  
For, if they should be put to such assays,  
Their gold’s so badly alloyed, in such ways,  
With brass, that though the coin delight the eye,  
’Twill rather break in two than bend, I cry.  

But now, for love of the good wife of Bath,  
Whose life and all whose sex may God maintain  
In mastery high, or else it were but scathe,  
I will, with joyous spirit, fresh and green,  
Sing you a song to gladden you, I ween;  
From all such serious matters let us be gone;  
Hearken my song, which runs in this way on:

### THE ENVOY OF CHAUCER

Griselda is dead, and dead is her patience;  
In Italy both at once lie buried, says the tale;  
For which I cry in open audience,  
That no wedded man be so hardy to assail  
His wife’s patience, in a hope to find  
A Griselda, for ’tis certain he shall fail!

O noble wives, full of a high prudence,  
Let not humility your free tongue nail,  
Nor let some clerk have cause for diligence  
To write of you so marvelous a tale  
As of Griselda, patient and so kind;  
Lest *Chichevache* swallow you in her entrail!

(Follow Echo, that holds no silence,  
But ever answers like a countervail;)  
Be not befooled for all your innocence,  
But take the upper hand, and so prevail.  
And well impress this lesson on your mind,  
For common profit, since it may avail.

Strong-minded women, stand at your defence,  
Since you are strong as camel and not frail;  
Suffer no man to do to you offence;  
And slender women in a contest frail,  
Be savage as a tiger there in Ind;  
Clatter like a mill, I counsel you, to beat the male.

Nay, fear them not, nor do them reverence.

(It seems to have been Chaucer’s intention, in the first instance, to end this tale here. Hence we find, in MSS. E. Hn. Cm. Dd., the following genuine but rejected stanza, suitable for insertion at this point:)

Behold the merry words of the Host:

This worthy clerk, whan that his tale was ended,  
Our hoste seyde, and swoor by Goddes bones,  
“Me were lever than a barel ale  
My wyf at hoom had herd this legende once;  
This is a gentil tale for the nones,  
And, to my purpos, wiste ye my wille;  
But that thing that wol nat be, lat it be stille.”)

Now when this worthy clerk had told his tale,  
Our Host remarked, and swore by God’s own bones:  
“I’d rather than receive a keg of ale  
My wife at home had heard this legend once;  
This is a noble story, for the nonce,  
And to my purpose — if you knew my will;  
But that which cannot be, let it lie still.”

Here endeth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxford.

*A fabulous monster in medieval satire that fed on patient wives, and was therefore very lean.*

For though your husband be all armed in mail,  
The arrows of your shrewish eloquence  
Shall pierce his breast and pierce his aventail.  
In jealousy I counsel that you bind,  
And you shall make him cower as does a quail.

*Middle English* (9078–9120)

For though thyn housbonde armed be in maille,  
The arwes of thy crabbed eloquence  
Shal pence his brest, and chek his aventaille;  
In jalousye I rede thee also binde,  
And thou shalt make him couche as dooth a quaille.

If thou be fair, where folk be in presence  
Show thou thy visage and thy apparel fair;  
If thou be foul, be liberal of thy expense,  
To gain thee friends, aye do thy travail there;  
Be aye of cheer as light as leaf on linden,  
And let him care, and weep, and wring, and wail!

*Here endeth the Clerk.*

## THE MERCHANT’S PROLOGUE

"Of weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow  
I know enough, at even and at morrow,"  
The Merchant said, "and so do many more  
Of married folk, I think, who this deplore,  
For well I know that it is so with me.  
I have a wife, the worst one that can be;  
For though the foul Fiend to her were wed,  
She’d overmatch him, this I dare to swear.

How could I tell you anything especial  
Of her great malice? She is shrew in all.  
There is a long and a large difference  
Between Griselda’s great patience  
And of my wife the passing cruelty.  
Were I unbound, as may I prosper be!  
I’d never other time fall in the snare.  
We wedded men live in sorrow and care;  
Assay who will, and he shall find, —  
I say the truth, by Saint Thomas of India, —  
As for the greater part, I say not all.  
God shield that it should so befall!

“Ah, good sir Host! I have been married, lad,  
These past two months, and no day more, by God;  
And yet, I think, he that all his life  
Has been without a wife, though men should rive  
Him to the heart, could in no wise declare  
So much of sorrow as I now may share  
Of my spouse’s cursedness!”  
“Now,” said our Host, “Merchant, so God you bless,  
Since you are so skilled in that art,  
Full heartily I pray you, tell us part.”  
“Gladly,” said he, “but of my own fresh sore;  
For grief of heart I may not tell you more.”

*Middle English* (9121–9175)

“Weping and wayling, care, and other sorwe  
I know y-nogh, on even and a-morwe,”  
Quod the Marchaunt, “and so don other mo  
That wedded been, I trowe that it be so.  
For, wel I woot, if fareth so with me.  
I have a wyf, the worste that may be;  
For, thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were,  
She wolde him overmacche, I dar wel swere.  
What sholde I yow reherce in special  
Hir hye malice? She is a shrewe at al.

Ther is a long and large difference  
Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience  
And of my wyf the passing crueltee.  
Were I unbounden, also moot I thee!  
I wolde never eft comen in the snare.  
We wedded men live in sorwe and care;  
Assaye who-so wol, and he shal finde  
I seye sooth, by seint Thomas of Inde,  
As for the more part, I sey nat alle.  
God shilde that it sholde so bifalle!

A! good sir hoost! I have y-wedded be  
These monthes two, and more nat, pardee;  
And yet, I trowe, he that all his lyve  
Wyflees hath been, though men wolde him ryve  
Un-to the herte, ne coude in no manere  
Tellen so muchel sorwe, as I now here  
Coude tellen of my wyves cursednesse!”  
“Now,” quod our hoost, “Marchaunt, so God yow blesse,  
Sin ye so muchel knowen of that art,  
Ful hertely I pray yow telle us part.”  
“Gladly,” quod he, “but of myn owene sore,  
For sory herte, I telle may na-more.”

## THE MERCHANT’S TALE

### HERE BEGYNNETH THE MERCHANT'S TALE

Whilom there dwelt in Lombardy  
A worthy knight, that born was of Pavia,  
In which he lived in great prosperity;  
And sixty year a wifeless man was he.  
And followed aye his bodily delight  
On women, whereof was his appetite,  
As do these folk that are secular.  
And when that he was passed sixty year,  
Were it for holiness or for dotage,  
I cannot say, but such a great corage  
Had this knight to been a wedded man,  
That day and night he did all that he can  
To spy and espy where he might wedded be;  
Praying Our Lord to grant to him that he  
Might once know of that blissful life  
That is betwixt a husband and his wife;  
And so to live within that holy bond  
By which God first did man and woman bond.

“No other life,” said he, “is worth a bean;  
For wedlock is so easy and so clean  
That in this world it is a paradise.”  
Thus said this old knight, that was so wise.  
And certainly, as sure as God is king,  
To take a wife, it is a glorious thing,  
And namely when a man is old and hoar;  
Then is a wife the fruit of all his store.  
Then should he take a young wife and a fair,  
On whom he might engender him an heir,  
And lead his life in joy and in solace,  
Whereas these bachelors cry out “Alas,”  
When that they find any adversity  
In love, which is but childish vanity.

And truly it sits well to be so,  
That bachelors have often pain and woe;  
On brittle ground they build, and brittle-ness  
They find when they suppose they have sure-ness.  
They live but as a bird or as a beast,  
In liberty, and under none arrest,  
Whereas a wedded man in his estate  
Liveth a life blissful and ornate,  
Under the yoke of marriage bound;  
Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound.

For who can be so docile as a wife?  
Who is so true, and eke so intentive  
To keep him, sick and whole, as is his make?  
For weal or woe, she will him never forsake.  
She is not weary him to love and serve,  
Though he lie bedridden till he die.  
And yet some clerks say it is not so,  
Of whom Theophrastus is one, I know.  
What force though Theophrastus list to lie?  
“Take no wife,” said he, “for husbandry,  
As for to spare in household thy expense;  
A true servant does more diligence  
Thy good to keep than thy own wedded wife.

For she will claim half part all her life;  
And if that thou be sick, so God me save,  
Thy very friends or an honest serving knave  
Will keep thee better than she that waits aye  
After thy good, and hath done many a day.”  
And if thou take a wife unto thy hold,  
Full lightly mayst thou been a cuckold.  
This sentence, and a hundred things worse,  
Writ this man, — may God his dead bones curse!  
But take no heed of all such vanity;  
Defy Theophrastus, and hearken unto me.

A wife is God’s own gift, aye verily;  
All other manner gifts hardily,  
As lands, rents, pasture, or common right,  
Or moveables, all be gifts of Fortune’s might,  
That pass as shadows on a wall.  
But, doubtless, if plainly speak I shall,  
A wife will last and in thy house endure  
Well longer than thee list, peradventure.  
Marriage is a full great sacrament;  
He which hath no wife, I hold him shent;  
He lives helpless and all desolate;  
I speak of folk in secular estate.

And hark why I say this not for naught:  
That woman was for man’s help wrought.  
The high God, when He had Adam made,  
And saw him all alone, bely-naked,  
God of His great goodness said then,  
“Let us now make a help unto this man  
Like to himself”; and then He made him Eve.  
Here may ye see, and hereby may ye prove,  
That wife is man’s help and his comfort,  
His paradise terrestre and his disport;  
So buxom and so virtuous is she,  
They must needs live in unity.  
One flesh they are, and one flesh, as I guess,  
Has but one heart, in weal and in distress.

A wife! Ah, Holy Mary, benedicite!  
How might a man have any adversity  
That hath a wife? Certes, I cannot say.  
The bliss that is betwixt them two for aye  
No tongue can tell, nor any heart can think.  
If he be poor, why, she helps him to swink;  
She keeps his goods and wastes never a deal;  
All that her husband lust, thereto her liking zeal;  
She says not once “nay” when he says “yea.”  
“Do this,” says he; “All ready, sir,” she’ll say.

O blissful order of wedlock precious,  
Thou art so merry, and eke so virtuous,  
So much commended and approved eke,  
That every man that holds him worth a leek  
Upon his bare knees ought all his life  
Thank God that He hath sent him such a wife;  
Or else pray God him for to send  
A wife to last unto his life’s end.  

(9236–9296)  

Lo, how that Jacob, as these clerks read,  
By good counsel of his mother Rebecca,  
Bound the kid’s skin about his neck;  
Through which his father’s benison he wan.  
Lo, Judith, as the story eke can tell,  
By wise counsel she God’s people kept,  
And slew Holofernes while he slept.  
Lo, Abigail, by good counsel how she  
Saved her husband Nabal, when that he  
Should have been slain; and lo, Esther also,  
By good counsel delivered out of woe  
The people of God, and made him Mordecai  
Of Ahasuerus exalted for to be.

There is nothing in degree superlative,  
As says Seneca, above a humble wife.  
Suffer thy wife’s tongue, as Cato bids;  
She shall command, and thou shalt suffer it;  
And yet she will obey, out of courtesy.  
A wife is keeper of thy husbandry;  
Well may the sick man bewail and weep  
Where there is none a wife the house to keep.

I warn thee, if wisely thou wilt work,  
Love well thy wife, as Christ loves His Church.  
If thou lovest thyself, thou lovest thy wife;  
No man hates his flesh, but in his life  
He fosters it, and therefore I bid thee,  
Cherish thy wife, or thou shalt never thee.  
Husband and wife, what so men jape or play,  
Of worldly folk hold the secure way;  
They are so knit, there may no harm betide:  
And namely, upon the wife’s side.

For which this January, of whom I told,  
Considered hath, in his days grown old,  
The lusty life, the virtuous quiete  
That is in marriage honey-sweet;  
And for his friends on a day he sent,  
To tell them the effect of his intent.  
With face sad, his tale he to them told;  
He said, “Friends, I am hoar and old,  
And almost, God wot, upon my pitts brinke;  
Upon my soul somewhat most I thinke.

I have my body fully squandered;  
Blessed be God, that it shall be amended!  
For I will be, certainly, a wedded man.  
And that anon, in all the haste I can,  
Unto some maid fair and tender of age.  
I pray you, shape for my mariage  
All suddenly, for I will not abide;  
And I will seek to spy, on my side,  
To whom I may be wedded hastily.

But forasmuch as ye be more than I,  
Ye shall rather such a thing espy  
Than I, and where me best were to ally.  
But one thing warn I you, my friends dear, —  
I will no old wife have in any wise.  
She shall not pass twenty year, certain;  
Old fish and young flesh would I have fain.  
“Better,” said he, “a pike than a pickerel;  
And better than old beef is tender veal.  
I will no woman thirty year of age;  
It is but bean-straw and great forage.)

*End of provided text.*

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE MERCHANT'S TALE

### Modern English

And for his friends upon a day he sent  
To tell them the effect of his intent.

With sober face his tale to them he told;  
He said to them: “My friends, I am hoar and old,  
And almost, God knows, come to my grave’s brink;  
About my soul, now, somewhat must I think.

I have my body foolishly expended;  
Blessed be God, that thing shall be amended!  
For I will be, truly, a wedded man,  
And that anon, in all the haste I can,  
Unto some maiden young in age and fair.  
I pray you for my marriage all prepare,  
And do so now, for I will not abide;  
And I will try to find one, on my side,  
To whom I may be wedded speedily.  
But for as much as you are more than I,  
It’s better that you have the thing in mind  
And try a proper mate for me to find.

“But of one thing I warn you, my friends dear,  
I will not have an old wife coming here.  
She shan’t have more than twenty years, that’s plain;  
Of old fish and young flesh I am full fain.  
‘Better,’ said he, ‘a pike than pickerel;  
And better than old beef is tender veal.  
I’ll have no woman thirty years of age;  
It is but bean-straw and such rough forage.

And these old widows, God knows, afloat,  
They know so much of spells when on Wade’s boat,  
And do such petty harm, when that they think best,  
That with one should I never live at rest.

For several schools can make men clever clerks;  
Woman in many schools learns clever works.  
But certainly a young thing men may guide,  
Just as warm wax may with one’s hands be plied.  
Wherefore I tell you plainly, in a clause,  
I will not have an old wife, for that cause.

For if it chanced I made that sad mistake  
And never in her could my pleasure take,  
My life I’d lead then in adultery  
And go straight to the devil when I die.  
No children should I then on her beget;  
Yet would I rather hounds my flesh should fret  
Than that my heritage descend and fall  
Into strange hands, and this I tell you all.

I dote not, and I know the reason why  
A man should marry, and furthermore know I  
There speaks full many a man of all marriage  
Who knows no more of it than knows my page,  
Nor for what reasons man should take a wife.  
If one may not live chastely all his life,  
Let him take wife whose quality he’s known  
For lawful procreation of his own  
Blood children, to the honour of God above,  
And not alone for passion or for love;  
And because lechery they should eschew  
And do their family duty when it’s due;  
Or because each of them should help the other  
In trouble, as a sister shall a brother;  
And live in chastity full decently.  
But, sirs, and by your leave, that is not I.

For, God be thanked, I dare to make a vaunt,  
I feel my limbs are strong and fit to jaunt  
In doing all man’s are expected to;  
I know myself and know what I can do.  
Though I am hoar, I fare as does a tree  
That blossoms ere the fruit be grown; you see  
A blooming tree is neither dry nor dead.  
And I feel nowhere hoary but on head;  
My heart and all my limbs are still as green  
As laurel through the year is to be seen.  
And now that you have heard all my intent,  
I pray that to my wish you will assent.”

Then divers men to him diversely told,  
Of marriage, many an instance known of old.  
Some blamed it and some praised it, that’s certain,  
But at the last, and briefly to make plain,  
Since altercation follows soon or late  
When friends begin such matters to debate,  
There fell a strife between his brothers two,  
Whereof the name of one was Placebo  
And verily Justinus was that other.

Placebo said: “O January, brother,  
Full little need had you, my lord so dear,  
Counsel to ask of anyone that’s here;  
Save that you are so full of sapience  
That you like not, what of your high prudence,

To vary from the word of Solomon.  
This word said he unto us each one:  
‘Do everything by counsel,’ thus said he,  
‘And then shalt thou not repent thee.’

But though that Solomon spoke such a word,  
My own dear brother and my lord,  
So wisely God my soul bring at rest,  
I hold your own counsel is the best.

For brother mine, of me take this motif,  
I have now been a court-man all my life.  
And God it wot, though I unworthy be,  
I have stood in full great degree  
Abouten lords of full high estate;  
Yet had I never with none of them debate.  
I never them contradicted, truly;  
I wot well that my lord can more than I.  
What that he saith, I hold it firm and stable;  
I say the same, or else some thing semblable.

A full great fool is any counsellor  
That serveth any lord of high honour,  
That dare presume, or else thenken it,  
That his counsel should pass his lord’s wit.  
Nay, lords be no foys, by my fay;  
Ye have yourselves shewed here today  
So high sentence, so holily and well,  
That I consent and confirm every deal  
Your words all, and your opinion.

By God, there is no man in all this town  
Ne in all Italy, that could have said it better;  
Christ would hold himself well paid of this counsel.  
And truly, it is an high courage  
Of any man, that standeth in age,  
To take a young wife; by my father kin,  
Your heart hangeth on a jolly pin.  
Do now in this matter right as you list.  
For finally I hold it for the best.”

Justinus, that aye still sat and heard,  
Right in this wise to Placebo answered:  
“Now brother mine, be patient, I pray,  
Since ye have said, and hearken what I say.  
For Seneca among his other words wise  
Says that a man ought himself well advise  
To whom he giveth his land or his chattels.

And since I ought advise me right well  
To whom I give my goods away from me,  
Well much more I ought advised be  
To whom I give my body; for alway  
I warn you well, it is no child’s play  
To take a wife without advisement.

Men must enquire, this is my assent,  
Whether she be wise, or sober, or a drunkard,  
Or proud, or else otherwise a shrew;  
A chider, or waster of thy good,  
Or rich, or poor, or else mannerly mad.  
Albeit it be so that no man shall find  
No one in this world that trotteth whole in all,  
No man nor beast, such as men could devise;  
But nevertheless, it ought enough suffice  
With any wife, if so were that she had  
More good thewes than her vices bad;  
And all this asketh leisure for to enquire.

For God knows I have wept full many a tear  
In privity, since I have had a wife.  
Praise who so will a wedded man’s good life,  
Truly I find in it but cost and care  
And many duties, of all blisses bare.  
And yet, God knows, my neighbours round about,  
Especially the women, many a rout,  
Say that I have married the most steadfast wife,  
Aye, and the meekest one there is in life.  
But I know best where pinches me my shoe.  
You may, for me, do as you please to do;  
But take good heed, since you’re a man of age,  
I warn you shall you enter into a marriage,  
Especially with a young wife and a fair.  
By Him who made the water, earth, and air,  
The youngest man there is in all this rout  
Is busy enough to bring the thing about  
That he alone shall have his wife, trust me.  
You’ll not be able to please her through years three,  
That is to say, to give all she desires.  
A wife attention all the while requires.  
I pray you that you be not offended.”

“Well?” asked this January, “And have you said?  
A straw for Seneca and your proverbs!  
I value not a basketful of herbs  
Your schoolmen’s terms; for wiser men than you,  
As you have heard, assent and bid me do  
My purpose now. Placebo, what say ye?”

“I say it is a wicked man,” said he,  
“That hinders matrimony, certainly.”

And with that word they rose up, suddenly,  
Having assented fully that he should  
Be wedded when he pleased and where he would.

Imagination and his eagerness  
Did in the soul of January press  
As he considered marriage for a space.  
Many fair shapes and many a lovely face  
Passed through his amorous fancy, night by night.  
As who might take a mirror polished bright  
And set it in the common market-place  
And then should see full many a figure pace  
Within the mirror; just in that same wise  
Did January within his thought surmise  
Of maidens whom he dwelt in town beside.  
He knew not where his fancy might abide.

For if the one have beauty of her face,  
Another stands so in the people’s grace  
For soberness and for benignity,  
That all the people’s choice she seems to be;  
And some were rich and had an evil name.  
Nevertheless, half earnest, half in game,  
He fixed at last upon a certain one  
And let all others from his heart be gone,  
And chose her on his own authority;  
For love is always blind and cannot see.

And when in bed at night, why then he wrought  
To portray, in his heart and in his thought,  
Her beauty fresh and her young age, so tender,  
Her middle small, her two arms long and slender,  
Her management full wise, her gentleness,  
Her womanly bearing, and her seriousness.

And when to her at last his choice descended,  
He thought his choice might not be amended.  
For when that he himself concluded had,  
He thought each other man’s wit so bad,  
That impossible it were to reply  
Against his choice, this was his fantasy.

His friends he sent to at his instance,  
And prayed them to do him that pleasance,  
That hastily they would to him come;  
He would abridge their labour, all and some.  
Nedeeth no more for him to go nor ride,  
He was appointed where he would abide.

Placebo came, and eke his friends anon,  
And first of all he bade them all a boon,  
That none of them make any argument  
Against the purpose which that he had taken;  
“Which purpose was pleasant to God,” said he,  
“And very ground of his prosperity.”

He said there was a maiden in the town  
Who of her beauty had great renown,  
Although it were so she was of small degree;  
Sufficed him her youth and her beauty.  
Which maiden, he said, he would have to his wife  
To lead in ease and holiness his life.  
And thanked God that he might have her all,  
That no wight of his bliss should part nor fall.  
And prayed them to labour in this need  
And shape that he fail not to speed;  
For then, he said, his spirit was at ease.  
“Then is,” said he, “nothing may me displease.  
Save one thing pricketh in my conscience,  
The which I will rehearse in your presence.

“I have,” said he, “heard said, full yore ago,  
There may no man have perfect blisses two,  
This is to say, in earth and eke in heaven.  
For though he keep him from the sins seven,  
And eke from every branch of that same tree,  
Yet is there so perfect felicity,  
And so great ease and lust in marriage,  
That ever I am agast, now in my age,  
That I shall lead now so merry a life,  
So delicate, without woe and strife,  
That I shall have my heaven in earth here.  
For since that very heaven is bought so dear,  
With tribulation and great penance,  
How should I then that live in such pleasance  
As all wedded men do with their wives,  
Come to the bliss where Christ eternal lives?  
This is my dread, and ye, my brethren twain,  
Absolve me this question, I pray.”

Justinus, which that hated his folly,  
Answered anon, right in his japery;  
And for he would his long tale abridge,  
He would no authority allege.  
But said, “Sire, so there be none obstacle  
Other than this, God of his high miracle  
And of his mercy may so for you work,  
That, ere you have your right of Holy Church,  
You may repent of wedded man’s life,  
In which you say there is no woe nor strife.  
And else, God forbid but he sent  
To wedded man him grace to repente

Often, and sooner than a single man!  
And therefore, sir, this is the best I can:  
Despair not, but retain in memory.  
Perhaps she may be your purgatory!  
She may be God’s mean, she may be God’s whip;  
Then shall your spirit up to Heaven skip  
Swifter than does an arrow from the bow!

I hope to God hereafter you shall know  
That there is none so great felicity  
In marriage, no nor ever shall there be,  
That shall let you of your salvation, your own;  
So that you use, with reason that’s well known,  
The charms of your wife’s body temperately,  
And that you please her not too amorously,  
And that you keep as well from other sin.  
My tale is done now, for my wit is thin.  
Be not deterred hereby, my brother dear”—  
(But let us pass quite over what’s said here.  
The Wife of Bath, if you have understood,  
Has treated marriage, in its likelihood,  
And spoken well of it in little space)—  
“Fare you well now, God have you in His grace.”

And with that word this Justin and his brother  
Did take their leave, and each of them from other.  
For when they all saw that it must needs be,  
They so arranged, by sly and wise treaty,  
That she, this maiden, who was Maia hight,  
As speedily indeed as ever she might,  
Should wedded be unto this January.

I think it were too long a time to tarry  
To tell of deed and bond between them, and  
The way she was enfeoffed of all his land;  
Or to hear tell of all her rich array.  
But finally was come the happy day  
When to the church together they two went,  
There to receive the holy sacrament.

Forth came the priest with stole about his neck,  
Saying of Rebecca and Sarah she should reck  
For wisdom and for truth in her marriage;  
And said his orisons, as is usage,  
And crossed them, praying God that He should bless,  
And made all tight enough with holiness.

Thus are they wedded with solemnity,  
And at the feast are sitting, he and she,  
With other worthy folk upon the dais.  
All full of joy and bliss the palace gay is,  
And full of instruments and viandry,  
The daintiest in all of Italy.

Before them played such instruments anon  
That Orpheus or Theban Amphion  
Never in life made such a melody.  
With every course there rose loud minstrelsy,  
And never Joab sounded trump to hear,  
Nor did Theodomas, one half so clear  
At Thebes, while yet the city hung in doubt.  
Bacchus the wine poured out for all about,  
And Venus gaily laughed for every wight.

For January had become her knight,  
And would make trial of his amorous power  
In liberty and in the bridal bower;

### Middle English

Placebo seyde: “O Januarie, brother,  
Ful litel nede hadde ye, my lord so dere,  
Conseil to axe of any that is here;  
But that ye been so ful of sapience,  
That yow ne lyketh, for your heighe prudence,  
To weyven fro the word of Salomon.

This word seyde he unto us everychon:  
‘Wirk alle thing by conseil,’ thus seide he,  
‘And thanne shaltow nat repente thee.’

But though that Salomon spak swich a word,  
Myn owene dere brother and my lord,  
So wisly God my soule bringe at reste,  
I holde your owene conseil is the beste.

For brother myn, of me tak this motif,  
I have now been a court-man al my lyf;  
And God it woot, though I unworthy be,  
I have standen in ful great degree  
Abouten lordes of full high estaat;  
Yet hadde I never with noon of hem debat.  
I never hem contraried, trewely;  
I woot wel that my lord can more than I.  
What that he seith, I holde it ferme and stable;  
I seye the same, or elles thing semblable.

A ful gret fool is any conseillour  
That serveth any lord of heigh honour,  
That dar presume, or elles thenken it,  
That his conseil sholde passe his lordes wit.  
Nay, lordes been no foys, by my fay;  
Ye han your-selven shewed heer to-day  
So heigh sentence, so holily and weel,  
That I consente and conferme every-deel  
Your wordes alle, and your opinioun.

By God, ther nis no man in al this toun  
Ne in al Itaille, that coude bet han said;  
Crist halt him of this conseil wel apayd.  
And trewely, it is an heigh corage  
Of any man, that stapeth is in age,  
To take a yong wif; by my fader kin,  
Your herte hangeth on a joly pin.  
Doth now in this matere right as yow leste.  
For finaly I holde it for the beste.”

Justinus, that ay stille sat and herde,  
Right in this wyse to Placebo answerde:  
“Now brother myn, be pacient, I preye,  
Sin ye han seyd, and herkneth what I seye.  
Senek among his othere wordes wise  
Seith, that a man oghte him right wel avyse  
To whom he yeveth his lond or his catel.

And sin I oghte avyse me right wel  
To whom I yeve my good awey fro me,  
Wel muchel more I oghte avysed be  
To whom I yeve my body; for alwey  
I wame yow wel, it is no childes pley  
To take a wif without avysement.

Men moste enquere, this is myn assent,  
Wher she be wys, or sobre, or dronkelewe,  
Or proud, or elles other-weys a shrewe;  
A chydester, or wastour of thy good,  
Or riche, or poore, or elles mannish wood.  
Al-be-it so that no man finden shal  
Noon in this world that trotteth hool in al,  
Ne man ne beest, swich as men coude devise;  
But nathelees, it oghte y-nough suffise  
With any wif, if so were that she hadde  
Mo gode thewes than hir vyces badde;  
And al this axeth leyser for to enquere.

For God woot I have wept ful many a tere  
In privity, sin I have had a wif.  
Preyse who-so wole a weded mannes lyf,  
Certes I finde in it but cost and care,  
And many observances of alle blisses bare.  
And yet God woot, my neighebores about,  
And namely of wommen many a rout,  
Sein that I have the moste stedfast wif,  
And eek the mekest oon that bereth lyf.  
But I wot best where wringeth me my sho.

Ye mowe, for me, right as yow lyketh do;  
Avyseth yow, ye been a man of age,  
How that ye entren into mariage,  
And namely with a yong wif and a fair.  
By him that made water, erthe, and air,  
The yongest man that is in al this route  
Is bisy enogh to bringe it aboute  
To han his wif allone, trusteth me.  
Ye shul nat plese hir fully yeres thre;  
This is to seyn, to doon hir ful plesaunce.  
A wif axeth ful many an observaunce.  
I preye yow that ye be nat yvel apayd.”

“Wel?” quod this Januarie, “and hastow seyd?  
Straw for thy Senek and for thy proverbes;  
I counte nat a panier ful of herbes  
Of scole-termes; wyser men than thou.  
As thou hast herd, assenten right now  
To my purpos; Placebo, what sey ye?”

“I seye, it is a cursed man,” quod he,  
“That letteth matrimoine, sikerly.”  
And with that word they rysen sodeynly,  
And been assented fully, that he sholde  
Be wedded whanne him list and wher he wolde.

Heigh fantasye and curious bisinesse  
Fro day to day gan in the soule impresse  
Of Januarie about his mariage.  
Many fair shape and many a fair visage  
Ther passeth through his herte, night by night.  
As who so toke a mirour polished bright,  
And sette it in a commune market-place,  
Than sholde he see many a figure pace  
By his mirour; and in the same wyse  
Gan Januarie in with his thoght devyse  
Of maydens which that dwelten him bisyde.  
He wiste nat wher that he mighte abyde.

For if that oon have beautee in hir face,  
Another stant so in the peples grace  
For hir sadnesse and hir benignite,  
That of the peple grettest vois hath she.  
And somme were riche and hadden badde name.  
But nathelees, bitwixe ernest and game,  
He at the laste apoynted him on oon,  
And leet alle othre from his herte goon,  
And chees hir of his owene auctoritee;  
For love is blind al day, and may nat see.

And whan that he was in his bed y-broght,  
He purtreyed in his herte and in his thoght  
Hir fresshe beautee and hir age tendre,  
Hir myddel smal, hir armes longe and sclendre,  
Hir wise governaunce, hir gentillesse,  
Hir wommanly beringe and hir sadnesse.  
And whan that he on hir was condescended,  
Him thoughte his chois might nat ben amended.  
For whan that he himself concluded hadde,  
Him thoughte eche other mannes wit so badde  
That impossible it were to replye  
Agayn his chois; this was his fantasye.

His frendes sente he to at his instaunce,  
And preyde hem to doon him that plesaunce,  
That hastily they wolden to him come;  
He wolde abregge hir labour, alle and some.  
Nedeth na-more for him to go ne ryde,  
He was apoynted where he wolde abyde.

Placebo cam, and eek his frendes sone,  
And alderfirst he bad hem alle a bone,  
That noon of hem make argumentes  
Agayn the purpos which that he hath take;  
“Which purpos was plesant to God,” seide he,  
“And verraie ground of his prosperitee.”

He seide, ther was a maiden in the toun  
Which that of beautee hadde greet renoun,  
Al were it so she were of smal degree;  
Suffyseth him hir youthe and hir beautee.  
Which maiden, he seide, he wolde han to his wif,  
To lede in ese and holinesse his lif.  
And thanked God that he mighte han hir al,  
That no wight of his blisse parten shal.  
And preyde hem to labouren in this need,  
And shapen that he faille nat to spede;  
For thanne, he seide, his spirit was at ese.  
“Thanne is,” quod he, “nothing may me displese.  
Save o thing priketh in my conscience,  
The which I wol reherce in your presence.

“I have,” quod he, “herd seyd ful yore ago,  
Ther may no man han parfite blisses two,  
This is to seye, in erthe and eek in hevene.  
For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene,  
And eke fro every branche of thilke tree,  
Yet is ther so parfit felicitee,  
And so greet ese and lust in mariage,  
That ever I am agast, now in myn age,  
That I shal lede now so mery a lyf,  
So delicat, withouten wo and stryf,  
That I shal have myn hevene in erthe here.  
For sith that verray hevene is boght so dere,  
With tribulacioun and greet penaunce,  
How sholde I thanne, that live in swich plesaunce  
As alle wedded men don with hir wyves,  
Come to the blisse ther Crist eterne on live is?  
This is my drede, and ye, my bretheren tweye,  
Assoilleth me this questioun, I preye.”

Justinus, which that hated his folye,  
Answerde anon, right in his japerye;  
And for he wolde his longe tale abregge,  
He wolde noon auctoritee allegge.  
But seide, “Sire, so ther be noon obstacle  
Other than this, God of his hye miracle  
And of his mercy may so for yow wirche,  
That, er ye have your right of holy chirche,  
Ye may repente of weded mannes lyf,  
In which ye seyn ther is no wo ne stryf.  
And elles, God forbede but he sente  
To weded man him grace to repente  
We often, and sooner than a single man!  
And therfore, sire, the best rede I can,  
Despeire yow noght, but have in memorie,  
Peraventure she may be your purgatorie!  
She may be Goddes mene and Goddes whippe;  
Than shal your soule up to hevene skippe  
Swifter than dooth an arwe out of the bowe!

I hope to God hereafter shul ye knowe  
That ther nis no so greet felicitee  
In mariage, ne never-mo shal be,  
That yow shal lette of your savacioun,  
So that ye use, as skile is and resoun,  
The lustes of your wif attemprely,  
And that ye plese hir nat to amorously,  
And that ye kepe yow eek from other sinne.  
My tale is doon, for my wit is thynne.  
Beth nat agast here-of, my brother dere.” —  
(But lat us waden out of this matere.  
The Wyf of Bathe, if ye han understonde,  
Of mariage, which we have on honde,  
Declaryng hath ful wel in litel space.) —  
“Fareth now wel, God have yow in his grace.”

And with this word this Justin and his brother  
Han take hir leve, and ech of hem of other.  
For whan they sawe it moste nedes be,  
They wroghten so by sly and wys tretee,  
That she, this mayden, which that Maius highte,  
As hastily as ever that she mighte,  
Shal wedded be unto this Januarie.

I trowe it were to longe yow to tarie,  
If I yow tolde of every scrit and bond  
By which that she was feffed in his lond;  
Or for to herknen of hir riche array.  
But finally y-comen is the day  
That to the chirche bothe be they went  
For to receyve the holy sacrament.

Forth comth the preest, with stole about his nekke,  
And bad hir be lik Sarra and Rebekke  
In wisdom and in trouthe of mariage;  
And seyde his orisons, as is usage,  
And crouched hem, and bad God sholde hem blesse,  
And made al siker ynogh with holinesse.

Thus been they wedded with solempnitee,  
And at the feste sitteth he and she  
With other worthy folk upon the deys.  
Al ful of joye and blisse is the palais,  
And ful of instruments and of vitaille,  
The most deyntevous of al Itaille.

Biforn hem stoode swiche instruments of soun  
That Orpheus ne of Thebes Amphioun  
Ne maden never swich a melodye.  
At every cours than cam loud minstraleye,  
That never tromped Joab for to here,  
Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clere,  
At Thebes, whan the citee was in doute.  
Bacchus the wyn hem skinketh al about,  
And Venus laugheth upon every wight.

For Januarie was bicome hir knight,  
And wolde bothe assayen his corage  
In libertee and eke in mariage;  
And with hir fyrbrond in hir hand about  
Daunceth bifore the bride and al the route.  
And certeinly I dar right wel seyn this,  
Ymenecus that God of wedding is,  
Saugh never his lyf so mery a wedded man.  
Hold thou thy pees, thou poete Marcian,

> "Oh, mercy! Don’t, I beg you, tell on me;  
> For I’m but dead if this thing be made known."  
> This purse she hid within the bosom of her gown,  
> And went her way; you get no more of me.  
> But unto January then came she,  
> That on his bedside sat in mood full soft.  
> He took her in his arms and kissed her oft,  
> And laid him down to sleep, and that anon.  
> And she pretended that she must be gone

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye  
Save he him-self; for of the smale wiket  
He bar alwey of silver a smal cliket,  

With which, whan that him leste, he it unshette.  
And whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette  
In somer seson, thider wolde he go,  

And May his wyf, and no wight but they two;  

And thinges whiche that were nat doon a-bedde.  
He in the gardin parfoumed hem and spedde.  

And in this wyse, many a mery day,  

Lived this Januarie and fresshe May.  

But worldly joye may nat alwey dure  
To Januarie, ne to no creature.

O sedeyn hap, o thou fortune instable,  
Lyk to the scorpioun so deceivable,  
That flaterest with thyn heed wher thou wolt stinge;  
Thy tayl is deeth, thurgh thyn enveniminge.  
O brotil joye! o swete venim queynte!  

O monstre, that so subtilly canst peynte  
Thy yiftes, under hewe of stedfastnesse,  
That thou deceyvest bothe more and lesse!  
Why hastow Januarie thus deceyved,  
That haddest him for thy ful frend receyved?  
And now thou hast biraft him bothe his eyen.  
For sorwe of which desireth he to dyen.  

Allas! this noble Januarie free,  
Amidde his lust and his prosperitee,  
Is woxen blind, and that al sodeynly.  
He wepeth and he wayleth pitously;  
And ther-with-al the fyr of jalousye,  
Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye,  
So brente his herte, that he wolde fayn  
That som man bothe him and hir had slayn.  
For neither after his deeth, nor in his lyf,  
Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf,  
But ever live as widwe in clothes blake,  
Soul as the turtle that lost hath hir make.  

But atte laste, after a monthe or tweye,  
His sorwe gan aswage, sooth to seye;  
For whan he wiste it may noon other be,  
He paciently took his adversitee;  
Save, out of doute, he may nat forgoon  
That he nas jalous evermore in oon;  
Which jalousye it was so outrageous,

## THE MERCHANT’S TALE

That neither in halle, n’in noon other hous,  
Ne in noon other place, never-the-mo,  
He nolde suffre hir for to ryde or go,  
But-if that he had hand on hir always.  
For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May,  
That loveth Damian so benignely,  
That she mot outher dyen sodeynly,  
Or elles she mot han him as hir leste;  
She wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste.  

Up-on that other syde Damian  
Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man  
That ever was; for neither night ne day  
Ne mighte he speke a word to fresshe May,  
As to his purpos, of no swich matere,  
But-if that Januarie moste it here,  
That hadde an hand up-on hir evermo.  

But nathelees, by wryting to and fro  
And privee signes, wiste he what she mente;  
And she knew eek the fyn of his entente.

That neither in his hall nor other house  
Nor in any other place, not ever, no,  
He suffered her to ride or walking go,  
Unless he had his hand on her alway;  
For which did often weep this fresh young May,  
Who loved her Damian so tenderly  
That she must either swiftly die or she  
Must have him as she willed, her thirst to slake;  
Biding her time, she thought her heart would break.  

And on the other side this Damian  
Was now become the most disconsolate man  
That ever was; for neither night nor day  
Might he so much as speak a word to May  
Of his desire, as I am telling here,  
Save it were said to January’s ear,  
Who never took his blind hand off her, no.  

Nevertheless, by writing to and fro  
And secret signals, he knew what she meant;  
And she too knew the aim of his intent.

O Januarie, what mighte it thee availle,  
Thou mightest see as fer as shippes saille?  

For also good is blind deceyved be,  
As be deceyved whan a man may see.  

Lo, Argus, which that hadde an hondred yēn,  
For al that ever he coude poure or pryen,  
Yet was he blent; and, God wot, so ben mo  
That wenen wisly that it be nat so.  

Passe over is an ese, I sey na-more.  

This fresshe May, that I spak of so yore,  
In warme wex hath emprented the cliket  
That Januarie bar of the smale wiket.  

By which into his gardin ofte he wente.  

And Damian, that knew al hir entente,  
The cliket countrefeted privily;  
Ther nis na-more to seye, but hastily  
Som wonder by this cliket shal bityde,  
Which ye shul heren, if ye wole abyde.

O noble Ovid, ful sooth seystou, God wot!  
What sleighte is it, thogh it be long and hoot,  
That he nil finde it out in som manere?  

By Piramus and Tesbee may men lere;  
Thogh they were kept ful longe streite overal,  
They been accorded, rouninge thurgh a wal,  
Ther no wight coude han founde out swich a sleighte.

But now to purpos; er that dayes eighte  
Were passed, er the monthe of Juil, bifil  
That Januarie hath caught so greet a wil,  
Thurgh egging of his wyf, him for to pleye  
In his gardin, and no wight but they tweye,  
That in a morwe unto this May seith he:

“Rys up, my wyf, my love, my lady free;  
The turtles vois is herd, my douve swete;  
The winter is goon, with alle his reynes wete;  
Com forth now, with thyn eyen columbyn!  
How fairer been thy brestes than is wyn!  
The gardin is enclosed al aboute;”

O noble Ovid, truth you say, God wot!  
What art is there, though it be long and hot,  
But Love will find it somehow suits his turn?  

By Pyramus and Thisbe may men learn;  
Though they were strictly kept apart in all,  
They soon accorded, whispering through a wall,  
Where none could have suspected any gate.  

But now to purpose: ere had passed days eight,  
And ere the first day of July, befell  
That January was under such a spell,  
Through egging of his wife, to go and play  
Within his garden, and no one but they,  
That on a morning to this May said he:

“Rise up, my wife, my love, my lady free;  
The turtle’s voice is heard, my dove so sweet;  
The winter’s past, the rain’s gone, and the sleet;  
Come forth now with your two eyes columbine!  
How sweeter are your breasts than is sweet wine!  
The garden is enclosed and walled about;

Come forth, my white spouse, for beyond all doubt  
You have me ravished in my heart, O wife!  
No fault have I found in you in my life.  
Come forth, come forth, and let us take our sport;  
I chose you for my wife and my comfort.”

Such were the lewd old words that then used he;  
To Damian a secret sign made she  
That he should go before them with his cliket;  

This Damian then opened up the wicket,  
And in he slipped, and that in manner such  
That none could see not hear; and he did crouch!  
And still he sat beneath a bush anon.

This January, blind as is a stone,  
With Maia’s hand in his, and none else there,  
Into his garden went, so fresh and fair,  
And then clapped to the wicket suddenly.

“Now, wife,” said he, “here’s none but you and I,  
And you’re the one of all that I best love.  
For by that Lord Who sits in Heaven above,  
Far rather would I die upon a knife  
Than do offence to you, my true, dear wife!  
For God’s sake think how I did choose you out,  
And for no love of money, beyond doubt,  
But only for the love you roused in me.  
And though I am grown old and cannot see,  
Be true to me, and I will tell you why.  

Three things, it’s certain, shall you gain thereby;  
First, Christ’s dear love, and honour of your own,  
And all my heritage of tower and town;  
I give it you, draw deeds to please you, pet;  
This shall be done tomorrow ere sunset.  
So truly may God bring my soul to bliss,  
I pray you first, in covenant, that we kiss.  
And though I’m jealous, yet reproach me not.  

You are so deeply printed in my thought  
That, when I do consider your beauty  
And therewith all the unlovely age of me,  
I cannot, truly, nay, though I should die,  
Abstain from being in your company,  
For utter love; of this there is no doubt.  
Now kiss me, wife, and let us walk about.”

This blooming May, when these words she had heard,  
Graciously January she answered,  
But first and foremost she began to weep.

“I have also,” said she, “a soul to keep  
As well as you, and also honour mine,  
And of my wifehood that sweet flower divine  
Which I assured you of, both safe and sound,  
When unto you that priest my body bound;  
Wherefore I’ll answer you in this manner,  
If I may by your leave, my lord so dear.  

I pray to God that never dawns the day  
That I’ll not die, foully as woman may,  
If ever I do unto my kin such shame,  
And likewise damage so my own fair name,  
As to be false; and if I grow so slack,  
Strip me and put me naked in a sack  
And in the nearest river let me drown.  
I am a lady, not a wench of town.  

Why speak you thus? Men ever are untrue,  
And women have reproaches always new.

Com forth, my whyte spouse; out of doute,  
Thou hast me wounded in myn herte, o wyf!  
No spot of thee ne knew I al my lyf.  
Com forth, and lat us taken our disport;  
I chees thee for my wyf and my confort.”

Swiche olde lewed wordes used he;  
On Damian a signe made she,  
That he sholde go biforen with his cliket:  
This Damian thanne hadde opened the wiket,  
And in he stirte, and that in swich manere,  
That no wight mighte it se neither y-herc;  
And stille he sit under a bush anoon.  

This Januarie, as blind as is a stoon,  
With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo,  
Into his fresshe gardin is ago,  
And clapte to the wiket sodeynly.

“Now, wyf,” quod he, “heer nis but thou and I,  
That art the creature that I best love.  
For, by that lord that sit in heven above,  
Lever ich hadde dyen on a knyf,  
Than thee offende, trewe dere wyf!  
For goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees,  
Noght for no coveityse, douteless,  
But only for the love I had to thee.  
And though that I be old, and may nat see,  
Beth to me trewe, and I shal telle yow why.  

Three thinges, certes, shul ye winne therby;  
First, love of Crist, and to your-self honour,  
And al myn heritage, toun and tour;  
I yeve it yow, maketh chartres as yow leste;  
This shal be doon to-morwe er sonne reste.  
So wisly god my soule bringe in blisse,  
I prey yow first, in covenant ye me kisse.  
And thogh that I be jalous, wyte me noght.  

Ye been so depe enprented in my thoght,  
That, whan that I considere your beautee,  
And ther-with-al the unlykly elde of me,  
I may nat, certes, thogh I sholde dye,  
Forbere to been out of your companye  
For verray love; this is with-outen doute.  
Now kis me, wyf, and lat us rome aboute.”

This fresshe May, whan she thise wordes herde,  
Benignely to Januarie answerde,  
But first and forward she bigan to wepe.

“I have,” quod she, “a soule for to kepe  
As wel as ye, and also myn honour,  
And of my wyfhod thilke tendre flour,  
Which that I have assured in your hond,  
Whan that the preest to yow my body bond;  
Wherfore I wole answere in this manere  
By the leve of yow, my lord so dere:  

I prey to God, that never dawe the day  
That I ne sterve, as foule as womman may,  
If ever I do un-to my kin that shame,  
Or elles I empeyre so my name,  
That I be fals; and if I do that lakke,  
Do strepe me and put me in a sakke,  
And in the nexte river do me drenche.  
I am a gentil womman and no wenche.  

Why speke ye thus? but men ben ever untrewe,  
And wommen have repreve of yow ay newe.

Ye han non other contenance, I leve.  
But speke to us of untrust and reprove.”

And with that word she saugh wher Damian  
Sat in the bush, and coughen she bigan.  
And with hir finger signes made she,  
That Damian sholde climbe up-on a tree,  
That charged was with fruit, and up he wente;  
For verraily he knew al hir entente.

And every signe that she coude make  
Was bet than Januarie, hir owene make.  
For in a lettre she had told him al  
Of this matere, how he werchen shai.  
And thus I lete him sitte up-on the pyrie,  
And Januarie and May rominge myrie.

Bright was the day, and blew the firmament,  
Phebus of gold his stremes doun hath sent  
To gladen every flour with his warmnesse.  
He was that tyme in Geminis, as I gesse,  
But litel fro his declinacioun  
Of Cancer, Jovis exaltacioun.

And so bifel, that brighte morwe-tyde,  
That in that gardin, in the ferther syde,  
Pluto, that is the king of fayrye,  
And many a lady in his companye,  
Folwinge his wyf, the quene Proserpyne,  
Ech after other, right as any lyne—  
Whyl that she gadered floures in the mede,  
In Claudian ye may the story rede,  
How in his grisly carte he hir fette:—  
This king of fairye thanne adoun him sette  
Up-on a bench of turves, fresh and grene.  
And right anon thus seyde he to his quene.

“My wyf,” quod he, “ther may no wight sey nay;  
Th’experience so preveth every day  
The treson whiche that wommen doon to man.  
Ten hondred thousand stories telle I can  
Notable of your untrouthe and brotilnesse.

O Salomon, wys, richest of richesse,  
Fulfild of sapience and of worldly glorie,  
Ful worthy been thy wordes to memorie  
To every wight that wit and reson can.

Thus preiseth he yet the bountee of man:  
‘Amonges a thousand men yet fond I oon,  
But of wommen alle fond I noon.’

Thus seith the king that knoweth your wikkednesse;  
And Jesus filius Syrak, as I gesse,  
Ne speketh of yow but selde reverence.

A wilde fyr and corrupt pestilence  
So falle up-on your bodies yet to-night!  
Ne see ye nat this honurable knight,  
By-cause, alasse! that he is blind and old.  
His owene man shal make him cokewold;  
Lo heer he sit, the lechour, in the tree.

Now wol I graunten, of my magestee,  
Un-to this olde blinde worthy knight  
That he shal have ayeyn his eyen sight,  
Whan that his wyf wold doon him vileinye;  
Than shal he knowen al hir harlotrye  
Both in repreve of hir and othere mo.”

“Ye shal,” quod Proserpyne, “wol ye so;

Now by my mother’s father’s soul, I swear  
That I will give her adequate answer,  
And all such women after, for her sake;  
That, though in any guilt caught, they’ll not quake,  
But with a bold face they’ll themselves excuse,  
And bear him down who would them thus accuse.  
For lack of answer none of them shall die.  

Nay, though a man see things with either eye,  
Yet shall we women brazen shamelessly  
And weep and swear and wrangle cleverly,  
So that you men shall stupid be as geese.  

What do I care for your authorities?  
I know well that this Jew, this Solomon,  
Found fools among us women, many a one.  
But though he never found a good woman,  
Yet has there found full many another man  
Women right true, right good, and virtuous.  
Witness all those that dwell in Jesus’ house;  
With martyrdom they proved their constancy.  

The Gesta Romanorum speak kindly  
Of many wives both good and true also.  

But be not angry, sir, though it be so  
That he said he had found no good woman,  
I pray you take the meaning of the man;  
He meant that sovereign goodness cannot be  
Except in God, Who is the Trinity.

“Ah, since of very God there is but one,  
Why do you make so much of Solomon?  
What though he built a temple for God’s house?  
What though he were both rich and glorious?  
So built he, too, a temple to false gods,  
How could he with the Law be more at odds?  
By gad, clean as his name you whitewash, sir,  
He was a lecher and idolater;  
And in old age the True God he forsook.  
And if that God had not, as says the Book,  
Spared him for father David’s sake, he should  
Have lost his kingdom sooner than he would.  

I value not, of all the villainy  
That you of women write, a butterfly.  
I am a woman, and needs must I speak,  
Or else swell up until my heart shall break.  
For since he said we gossip, rail, and scold,  
As ever may I my fair tresses hold,  
I will not spare, for any courtesy,  
To speak him ill who’d wish us villainy.”

“Dame,” said this Pluto, “be no longer wroth;  
I give it up; but since I swore my oath  
That I would give to him his sight again,  
My word shall stand, I warn you that’s certain.  
I am a king, it suits me not to lie.”

“And I,” said she, “am queen of Faery.  
Her answer shall she have, I undertake;  
No further talk hereof let us two make;  
Forsooth, I will not longer be contrary.”

Now let us turn again to January,  
Who in the garden with his lovely May  
Sang, and that merrier than the popinjay,  
“I love you best, and ever shall, I know.”  

And so about the alleys did he go  
Till he had come at last to that pear-tree

Where-as this Damian sitteth ful myrie  
On heigh, among the fresshe leves grene.

This fresshe May, that is so bright and shene,  
Gan for to syke, and scydde, “alasse, my syde!  
Now sir,” quod she, “for aught that may bityde,  
I moste han of the peres that I see,  
Or I mot dye, so sore longeth me  
To eten of the smale peres grene.  
Help, for hir love that is of hevene quene!  

I telle yow wel, a womman in my plyt  
May han to fruit so greet an appetyt,  
That she may dyen, but she of it have.”

“Allas!” quod he, “that I ne had heer a knave  
That coude climbe; alasse! alasse!” quod he,  
“That I am blind.”

“Ye, sir, no fors,” quod she:  
“But wolde ye vouche-sauf, for goddes sake,  
The pyrie in with your armes for to take,  
(For wel I woot that ye mistruste me)  
Thanne sholde I climbe wel y-nogh,” quod she,  
“So I my foot mighte sette upon your bak.”

“Certes,” quod he, “ther-on shal be no lak,  
Mighte I yow helpen with myn herte blood.”  

He stoupeth doun, and on his bak she stood,  
And caughte hir by a twiste, and up she gooth.  
Ladies, I prey yow that ye be nat wrooth;  
I can nat glose, I am a rude man.

And sodeynly anon this Damian  
Gan pullen up the smok, and in he throng.  
And whan that Pluto saugh this grete wrong,  
To Januarie he gaf agayn his sighte,  
And made him see, as wel as ever he mighte.

And whan that he hadde caught his sighte agayn,  
Ne was ther never man of thing so fayn.  
But on his wyf his thoght was evermo;  
Up to the tree he caste his eyen two.  

And saugh that Damian his wyf had dressed  
In swich manere, it may nat ben expressed  
But if I wolde speke uncurteisly:  
And up he yaf a roring and a cry  
As doth the moder whan the child shal dye:  
“Out! help! alasse! harrow!” he gan to crye,  
“O stronge lady store, what dostow?”  

And she answerde, “sir, what eyleth yow?  
Have pacience, and reson in your minde,  
I have yow holpe on bothe your eyen blinde.  
Up peril of my soule, I shal nat lyen,  
As me was taught, to hele with your yen.  
Was no-thing bet to make yow to see  
Than strugle with a man up-on a tree.  
God woot, I dide it in ful good entente.”

“Strugle!” quod he, “ye, algate in it wente!  
God yeve yow bothe on shames deeth to dyen!  
He swyved thee, I saugh it with myne yen,  
And elles be I hanged by the hals!”

“Thanne is,” quod she, “my medicyne al fals;  
For certeinly, if that ye mighte see,  
Ye wolde nat seyn thise wordes un-to me;  
Ye han som glimsing and no parfit sighte.”

“I see,” quod he, “as wel as ever I mighte,  
Thonked be God! with bothe myne eyen two,  
And by my trouthe, me thoughte he dide thee so.”  

(Herein this Damian sat right merrily  
On high, among the young leaves fresh and green.)

His blooming May, who was so bright of sheen,  
Began to sigh, and said: “Alas, my side!  
Now, sir,” said she, “no matter what betide,  
I must have some of these pears that I see,  
Or I may die, so much I long,” said she,  
“To eat some of those little pears so green.  
Help, for Her love Who is of Heaven queen!  

I tell you well, a woman in my plight  
May have for fruit so great an appetite  
That she may die if none of it she have.”

“Alas!” said he, “that I had here a knave  
That could climb up, alas, alas!” said he,  
“That I am blind.”

“Yea, sir, no odds,” said she,  
“If you’d but grant me, and for God’s dear sake,  
That this pear-tree within your arms you’d take  
(For well I know that you do not trust me),  
Then I could climb up well enough,” said she,  
“So I my foot might set upon your back.”

“Surely,” said he, “thereof should be no lack,  
Might I so help you with my own heart’s blood.”  

So he stooped down, and on his back she stood,  
And gave herself a twist and up went she.  
Ladies, I pray you be not wroth with me;  
I cannot gloze, I’m an uncultured man.

## EPILOGUE TO THE MERCHANT’S TALE

> For of a sudden thus said Damian:
> 
> Pulled up her smock and thrust both deep and long.
> 
> And when King Pluto saw this awful wrong,
> 
> To January he gave again his sight,
> 
> And made him see as well as ever he might.
> 
> And when he thus had got his sight again,
> 
> Never was man of anything so fain.
> 
> But since his wife he thought of first and last,
> 
> Up to the tree his eyes he quickly cast,
> 
> And saw how Damian his wife had dressed
> 
> In such a way as cannot be expressed,
> 
> Save I should rudely speak and vulgarly:
> 
> And such a bellowing clamour then raised he
> 
> As does a mother when her child must die:
> 
> “Out! Help! Alas! Oh, help me!” he did cry,
> 
> “Outlandish, brazen woman, what do you do?”
> 
> And she replied: “Why, sir, and what ails you?
> 
> Have patience, and do reason in your mind
> 
> That I have helped you while your two eyes were blind.
> 
> On peril of my soul, I tell no lies,
> 
> But I was taught that to recover eyes
> 
> Was nothing better, so to make you see,
> 
> Than struggle with a man up in a tree.
> 
> God knows I did it with a good intent.”
> 
> “Struggle!” cried he, “but damme, in it went!
> 
> God give you both a shameful death to die!
> 
> He banged you, for I saw it with my eye,
> 
> Or may they hang me by the neck up, else!”
> 
> “Then is,” said she, “my medicine all false;
> 
> For certainly, if you could really see,
> 
> You would not say these cruel words to me;
> 
> You catch but glimpses and no perfect sight.”
> 
> “I see,” said he, “as well as ever I might —
> 
> Thanks be to God! — and with my two eyes, too,
> 
> And, truth, I thought he did that thing to you.”
> 
> “You are bewildered still, good sir,” said she,
> 
> “Such thanks I have for causing you to see;
> 
> Alas!” she cried, “that ever I was so kind!”
> 
> “Now, dame,” said he, “put all this out of mind.
> 
> Come down, my dear, and if I have missaid,
> 
> God help me if I’m not put out indeed.
> 
> But by my father's soul, I thought to have seen
> 
> How Damian right over you did lean
> 
> And that your smock was pulled up to his breast.”
> 
> “Yes, sir,” said she, “you may think as best you please;
> 
> But, sir, a man that wakens out of sleep,
> 
> He cannot suddenly take note and keep
> 
> Of any thing, or see it perfectly,
> 
> Until he has recovered verily;
> 
> Just so a man that blinded long has been,
> 
> He cannot say that suddenly he's seen
> 
> So well, at first, when sight is new to him,
> 
> As later, when his sight's no longer dim.
> 
> Until your sight be settled for a while,
> 
> There may full many a thing your mind beguile.
> 
> Beware, I pray you, for, by Heaven's King,
> 
> Full many a man thinks that he sees a thing,
> 
> And it is other quite than what it seems.
> 
> And he that misconstrues, why, he misdeems.”
> 
> And with that word she leaped down from the tree.
> 
> This January, who is glad but he?
> 
> He kissed her, and he hugged her much and oft,
> 
> And on her belly stroked and rubbed her soft,
> 
> And home to palace led her, let me add.
> 
> And now, good men, I pray you to be glad.
> 
> For here I end my tale of January;
> 
> God bless us, and His Mother, Holy Mary!

### Modern English (Narrative and Verse)

> At Sarai, in the land of Tartary,
> 
> There dwelt a king who warred on Russia, he,
> 
> Whereby there died full many a doughty man.
> 
> This noble king was known as Cambinskan,
> 
> Who in his time was of so great renown
> 
> That there was nowhere in the wide world known
> 
> So excellent a lord in everything;
> 
> He lacked in naught belonging to a king.
> 
> As for the faith to which he had been born,
> 
> He kept its law to which he had been sworn;
> 
> And therewith he was hardy, rich, and wise,
> 
> And merciful and just in all men's eyes,
> 
> True to his word, benign and honourable,
> 
> And in his heart like any centre stable;
> 
> Young, fresh, and strong, in warfare ambitious
> 
> As any bachelor knight of all his house.
> 
> Of handsome person he was fortunate,
> 
> And kept always so well his royal state
> 
> That there was nowhere such another man.
> 
> This noble king, this Tartar Cambinskan
> 
> Had got two sons on Elpheta, his wife,
> 
> Of whom the elder’s name was Algarsyf,
> 
> And that same second son was Cambalo.
> 
> A daughter had this worthy king, also,
> 
> Who was the youngest, and called Canace.
> 
> But to describe to you all her beauty,
> 
> It lies not in my tongue nor in my cunning;
> 
> I dare not undertake so high a thing.
> 
> My English is quite insufficient for
> 
> What must require a finished orator
> 
> Who knew the colours needful to that art
> 
> If he were to describe her every part.
> 
> I am none such, I must speak as I can.
> 
> And so befell that, when this Cambinskan
> 
> Had twenty winters worn his diadem,
> 
> As he was wont from year to year, I deem,
> 
> He let the feast of his nativity
> 
> Be cried throughout all Sarai, his city,
> 
> The last Idus of March, as ’twas that year.
> 
> Phoebus the sun right festive was and clear;
> 
> For he was near his exaltation grown
> 
> In face of Mars, and in his mansion known
> 
> In Aries, the choleric hot sign.
> 
> Right pleasant was the weather, and benign,
> 
> For which the wild birds in the sun’s gold sheen,
> 
> At that season and the springing green,
> 
> Full loudly sang their lays and their affection;
> 
> It seemed that they had got them protection
> 
> Against the sword of winter keen and cold.
> 
> This Cambinskan, of whom I have you told,
> 
> High in the palace, mounted on his throne
> 
> With crown and royal vestments sat alone,
> 
> And held his feast, so splendid and so rich
> 
> That in this world its like was not, of which,
> 
> If I should tell you all of the array,
> 
> Then would it occupy a summer’s day.
> 
> Besides, it needs not here that I apprise
> 
> Of every course the order of service.
> 
> I will not tell you of each strange sauce,
> 
> Nor of their swans, nor of their heron-shaws.
> 
> Moreover, in that land, as tell knights old,
> 
> There are some foods which they for dainties hold,
> 
> Of which in this land the esteem is small;
> 
> There is no man that can report them all.
> 
> I will not so delay you, for it’s prime,
> 
> And all the fruit of this were loss of time;
> 
> Unto my first theme I will have recourse.
> 
> And so befell that, after the third course,
> 
> While this great king sat in his state that day,
> 
> Hearing his minstrels on their instruments play
> 
> Before him at the board, deliciously,
> 
> In at the hall door, and all suddenly,
> 
> There came a knight upon a steed of brass,
> 
> Holding in hand a mirror broad of glass.
> 
> Upon his thumb he had a golden ring,
> 
> And by his side a naked sword hanging;
> 
> And up he rode right to the highest board.
> 
> In all the hall there was not spoken word
> 
> For marvel of this knight; him to behold,
> 
> They stared and stretched and craned, both young and old.
> 
> This stranger knight, who came thus suddenly,
> 
> Armed at all points, except his head, richly,
> 
> Saluted king and queen and those lords all,
> 
> In order of rank, as they sat there in hall,
> 
> Showing such humble courtesy to each
> 
> In manner of behaviour and in speech,
> 
> That Gawain, with his old-time courtesy,
> 
> Though he were come again from Faery,
> 
> Could not have bettered him in any word.
> 
> And after this, before the king’s high board,
> 
> He with a manly voice said his message,
> 
> After the form in use in his language,
> 
> Without mistake in syllable or letter;
> 
> And, that his tale should seem to all the better,
> 
> According to his language was his cheer,
> 
> As men teach art of speech both there and here;
> 
> Albeit that I cannot ape his style,
> 
> Nor can I climb across so high a stile,
> 
> Yet say I this, as to his broad intent,
> 
> To this amounts the whole of what he meant,
> 
> If so be that I have it yet in mind.
> 
> He said: “The king of Araby and Ind,
> 
> My liege-lord, on this great and festive day
> 
> Salutes you as he now best can and may,
> 
> And sends to you, in honour of your feast,
> 
> By me, that am prepared for your behest,
> 
> This steed of brass, that easily and well
> 
> Can, in one natural day — that is to tell —
> 
> In four and twenty hours,
> 
> Where’er you please, in drought or else in showers,
> 
> Bear your body unto every place
> 
> To which your heart wills that you go apace,
> 
> Without least hurt to you, through foul or fair;
> 
> Or, if you please to fly as high in air
> 
> As does an eagle when he wills to soar,
> 
> This self-same steed will bear you evermore
> 
> Without least harm, till you have gained your quest,
> 
> Although you sleep upon his back, or rest;
> 
> And he’ll return, by twisting of a pin.
> 
> He that made this could make full many a gin;
> 
> He waited, watching many a constellation
> 
> Before he did contrive this operation;
> 
> And he knew many a magic seal and band.
> 
> This mirror, too, which I have in my hand,
> 
> Has power such that in it men may see
> 
> When there shall happen any adversity
> 
> Unto your realm, and to yourself also;
> 
> And openly who is your friend or foe.
> 
> More than all this, if any lady bright
> 
> Has set her heart on any kind of wight,
> 
> If he be false she shall his treason see,
> 
> His newer love and all his subtlety
> 
> So openly that nothing can he hide.
> 
> Wherefore, upon this pleasant summertide,
> 
> This mirror and this ring, which you may see,
> 
> He has sent to my lady Canace,
> 
> Your most surpassing daughter, who is here.
> 
> “The virtue of the ring, if you will hear,
> 
> Is this: that if she pleases it to wear
> 
> Upon her thumb, or in her purse to bear,
> 
> There is no bird that flies beneath the heaven
> 
> But she shall understand his language, even
> 
> To know his meaning openly and plain,
> 
> And answer him in his own words again.
> 
> And every herb that grows upon a root
> 
> She shall know, too, and whom ’twill heal, to boot,
> 
> Although his wounds be never so deep and wide.
> 
> This naked sword that’s hanging by my side
> 
> Such virtue has that any man you smite,
> 
> Right through his armour will it carve and bite,
> 
> Were it as thick as is a branching oak;
> 
> And that man who is wounded by its stroke
> 
> Shall never be whole until you please, of grace,
> 
> To strike him with the flat in that same place
> 
> Where he is hurt; which is to say, ’tis plain,
> 
> That you may with the flat sword blade again
> 
> Strike him upon the wound and it will close;
> 
> This is the truth, I seek not to impose,
> 
> For it shall fail not while it’s in your hold.”
> 
> And when this knight had thus his message told,
> 
> He rode out of the hall and did alight.
> 
> His steed, which shone as sun does, and as bright,
> 
> Stood in the courtyard, still as any stone.
> 
> This knight was to a chamber led anon,
> 
> And was unarmed, and there at meat sat down.
> 
> The gifts were brought and royally were shown
> 
> — that is to say, the sword and glass of power —
> 
> And borne anon into the donjon tower
> 
> By certain officers detailed thereto;

> With ceremony, where she sat at table.
> 
> But certainly, without a fancied fable,

> The horse of brass could by no means be moved;
> 
> It stood as if ’twere glued unto the ground.
> 
> There was no man could lead it out or drive
> 
> With any engine of windlass or of pow’r;
> 
> And therefore in that place they had to leave it
> 
> Until the knight had taught them the manner
> 
> Of moving it, as you’ll hereafter hear.
> 
> Great was the press of people to and fro,
> 
> Swarming to see this horse that stood there so;
> 
> For it was high, and broad, and long.
> 
> So well proportioned as to be most strong,
> 
> Just as if it were a steed of Lombardy;
> 
> Therewith so horsely and so quick of eye
> 
> As if a gentle Apulian courser ’twere.
> 
> For certes, from his tail unto his ear
> 
> Nature nor art could better nor amend

> In any wise, as people did contend.
>

> So many heads, so many wits, one sees.

> Recalling what they'd learned from poetry;

> Who have in mind this capital to win.
> 
> It were right well that of such things we know.”

> Another whispered to his fellow, low,

> And said: “He lies, for it is rather like

> As vulgar people chatter commonly
> 
> Of all things that are made more cunningly
> 
> Than they can in their ignorance comprehend;
> 
> They gladly judge they’re made for some base end.
> 
> And some much wondered on the mirror’s power,

> And how men in it such strange things could see.
> 
> Another answered, saying it might be
> 
> Quite natural, by angles oddly spaced

> And sly reflections thus within it placed,
> 
> And said, at Rome was such a one, men know.
> 
> They spoke of Alhazen and Yitello

> And Aristotle, who wrote in their lives
> 
> On mirrors strange and on perspectives,
> 
> As all they know who’ve read their published word.
> 
> And other folk did wonder on the sword
> 
> That had the power to pierce through anything;
> 
> And full in speech of Thelophus the king,
> 
> And of Achilles with his quainted spear,
> 
> For he could with it both heal and slay.
> 
> Right in such wise as men may with the sword
> 
> Of which right now ye have yourselves heard.
> 
> They spoke of sundry hardening of the metal,
> 
> And spake of medicines therewithal,
> 
> And how, and when, it should be hardened;
> 
> Which is unknown, at least, unto me.
> 
> Then spake they of Canace's ring,
> 
> And said all that such a wonderous thing
> 
> Of craft of rings had they never heard of none,
> 
> Save that Moses and king Solomon
> 
> Had a name of knowing in such art.
> 
> Thus spake the people, and drew them apart.
> 
> But nevertheless some said that it was
> 
> Wonder to make of far-off ashen glass,

> And yet is glass not like ashen of fern;

# The Canterbury Tales (Part 35 of 76)

Therefore cesseth her jangling and her wonder.

As sore wonder some on cause of thunder,  
On ebbe, on flood, on gossomer, and on mist,  
And alle thing, til that the cause is wist.

Thus jangle they and demen and devise,  
Til that the king gan fro the bord aryse.

Phebus hath left the angle meridional,  
And yet ascending was the beest royal.  
The gentil Leon, with his Aldiran,  
Whan that this Tartar king, this Cambinskan,  
Roos fro his bord, ther that he sat ful hye.

Tofore him gooth the loud minstralcye,  
Til he cam to his chambre of paraments,  
Ther as they sownen diverse instruments,  
That it is lyk an heven for to here.  
Now dauncen lusty Venus children dere,  
For in the Fish hir lady sat ful hye,  
And loketh on hem with a freendly ye.

This noble king is set up in his trone;  
This strange knight is fet to him ful sone;  
And on the daunce he gooth with Canacee.  
Heer is the revel and the jolitee  
That is nat able a dul man to devyse.  
He moste han knowen love and his servyse,  
And been a festlich man as fresh as May,  
That sholde yow devysen swich array.

Who coude telle yow the forme of daunces,  
So uncouthe and so fresshe contenaunces,  
Swich subtil loking and dissimulinges  
For drede of jalouse mennes aperceyvinges?  
No man but Launcelot, and he is deed.  
Therefor I passe of al this lustiheed;  
I seye na-more, but in this jolinesse  
I lete hem, til men to the soper dresse.

The styward bit the spyces for to hye,  
And eek the wyn, in al this melodye.  
The usshers and the squyers ben y-goon;  
The spyces and the wyn is come anoon.  
They ete and drinke; and whan this hadde an ende,  
Unto the temple, as reson was, they wende.

---

And so they spoke of Telcphus the king,  
And of Achilles with his magic spear,  
Herewith he healed and hurt also, as soon appear,  
Even as a man might do with this new sword  
Of which, but now, I’ve told and you have heard.  
They spoke of tempering metal sundry wise,  
And medicines therewith, which men devise,  
And how and when such steel should hardened be;  
Which, nevertheless, is all unknown to me.

Then spoke they of fair Canace’s gold ring,  
And all men said that such a wondrous thing  
They’d ne’er heard of as being in ring-craft done,  
Except that Moses and King Solomon  
Had each a name for cunning in such art.

Thus spoke the people and then drew apart;  
But notwithstanding, some said that it was  
Wondrous to make fern-ashes into glass,  
Since glass is nothing like the ash of fern;  
But since long since of this thing men did learn,  
Therefore they ceased their gabble and their wonder,  
As sorely wonder some on cause of thunder,  
Of ebb, of flood, of gossamer, of mist,  
And each thing, till they know what cause exist.

Thus did they chatter and judge and thus surmise  
Until the king did from the board arise.  
Phoebus had left the angle meridional,  
And yet ascending was that beast royal,  
The noble Lion, with his Aldiran,  
When that this Tartar king, this Cambinskan,  
Rose from his board where he had sat full high.

Before him went the sounding minstrelsy,  
Into a room hung with rich ornaments,  
Wherein they sounded divers instruments  
Till it was like a heavenly thing to hear.  
And now danced merry Venus’ children dear,  
For in the Fish their lady sat on high  
And looked upon them with a friendly eye.

This noble king sat high upon his throne,  
And this strange knight was brought to him anon,  
And then to dance he went with Canacee.  
Here was such revel and such jollity  
As no dull man is able to surmise;  
He must have known and served love’s high emprise,  
And be a festive man as fresh as May  
Who could for you describe such an array.

Who could tell you the figures of the dances,  
So odd and strange and the blithe countenances,  
The subtle glances and dissimulation  
For fear of jealous persons’ observation?  
No man but Launcelot, and he is dead!  
I therefore pass the joyous life they led  
And saw no more, but in this jolliness  
I leave them till to supper all did press.

The steward bade them serve the spices, aye,  
And the rich wine through all this melody.  
The ushers and the squires got them gone;  
The spices and the wine were come anon.  
They ate and drank, and when this had an end,  
Unto the temple, as was right, did wend.

## The Squire’s Tale

The service done, they supped while yet 'twas day.  
What needs it that I tell all their array?  
Each man knows well that at a kingly feast  
There's plenty for the greatest and the least,  
And dainties more than are in my knowing.

Then, after supper, went this noble king  
To see the horse of brass, with all the rout  
Of lords and ladies thronging him about.

Such wondering was there on this horse of brass  
That, since the siege of Troy did overpass,  
When once a horse seemed marvellous to men,  
Was there such wondering as happened then.

But finally the king asked of this knight  
The virtue of this courser, and the might,  
And prayed him tell the means of governance.

This horse anon began to trip and dance  
When this strange knight laid hand upon the rein  
And said: “Sire, there's no more I need explain  
Than, when you wish to journey anywhere,  
You must but twirl a peg within his ear,  
Which I will show you when alone with you.

You must direct him to what place also,  
Or to what country you may please to ride;  
And when you come to where you would abide,  
Bid him descend, and twirl another pin,  
For therein lies the secret of the gin,  
And he will then descend and do your will;  
And there he'll stand, obedient and still.

Though all the world the contrary had sworn,  
He shall not thence be drawn nor thence be borne.  
Or, if you wish to bid him thence be gone,  
Twirl but this pin and he'll depart anon  
And vanish utterly from all men's sight,  
And then return to you, by day or night,  
When you shall please to call him back again  
In such a fashion as I will explain  
When we two are alone, and that full soon.  
Ride when you choose, there's no more to be done.”

Instructed thus when the king was by that knight,  
And when he'd established in his mind aright  
The method and the form of all this thing,  
Then glad and blithe this noble doughty king  
Repaired unto his revels as before.

The bridle to the donjon tower they bore,  
And placed among his jewels rich and dear.  
How I know not, the horse did disappear  
Out of their sight; you get no more of me.  
But thus I leave, in joy and jollity,  
This Cambinskan with all his lords feasting  
Well nigh until the day began to spring.

---

[10,611–10,667]

The service doon, they soupen al by day.  
What nedeth yow rehercen hir array?  
Ech man wot wel, that at a kinges feeste  
Hath plentee, to the moste and to the leeste,  
And deyntees mo than been in my knowing.

At-after soper gooth this noble king  
To seen this hors of bras, with al the route  
Of lordes and of ladyes him aboute.

Swich wondring was ther on this hors of bras  
That, sin the grete sege of Troye was,  
Ther-as men wondreden on an hors also,  
Ne was ther swich a wondring as was tho.

But fynally the king axeth this knight  
The vertu of this courser and the might,  
And preyede him to telle his governaunce.

This hors anoon bigan to trippe and daunce  
Whan that this knight leyde hand upon his reyne.  
And seyde, “sir, ther is na-more to seyne.  
But, whan yow list to ryden any-where,  
Ye moten trille a pin, stant in his ere,  
Which I shall telle yow bitwix vs two.

Ye mote nempne him to what place also  
Or to what contree that yow list to ryde.  
And whan ye come ther as yow list abyde,  
Bidde him descende, and trille another pin,  
For ther-in lyth the effect of al the gin,  
And he wol doun descende and doon your wille;  
And in that place he wol abyde stille,

Though al the world the contrarie hadde y-swore;  
He shal nat thennes ben y-drawe n'y-bore.  
Or, if yow liste bidde him thennes goon,  
Trille this pin, and he wol vanishe anoon  
Out of the sighte of every maner wight,  
And come agayn, be it by day or night,  
When that yow list to clepen him ageyn  
In swich a gyse as I shal to yow seyn  
Bitwixe yow and me, and that ful sone.  
Ryde whan yow list, ther is na-more to done.”

Enformed whan the king was of that knight  
And hath conceived in his wit aright  
The maner and the forme of al this thing,  
Thus glad and blythe, this noble doughty king  
Repeireth to his revel as biforn.

The brydel is un-to the tour y-born,  
And kept among his jewels leve and dere.  
The hors vanisshed, I noot in what manere,  
Out of hir sighte; ye gete na-more of me.

But thus I lete in lust and Iolitee  
This Cambynskan his lordes festeyinge,  
Til wel ny the day bigan to springe.

### Here endeth the first part

THE CANTERBURY TALES

HERE FOLLOWETH

The nurse of good digestion, natural sleep,  
Caused them to nod, and bade them they take keep  
That labour and much drinking must have rest;  
And with a gaping mouth all these he pressed,  
And said that it was time they laid them down,  
For blood was in the ascendant, as was shown,  
And nature’s friend, the blood, must honoured be.

---

## The Second Part

The norice of digestioun, the slepe,  
Gan on hem winke, and bad hem taken kepe,  
That muchel drink and labour wolde han reste;  
And with a gaping mouth hem alle he keste,  
And seyde, “it was tyme to lye adoun.  
For blood was in his dominacioun;  
Cherissheth blood, natures freend,” quod he.

[10,668–10,727]

They thanken him gaping, by two, by three,  
And every wight gan drawe him to his reste,  
As slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste.

Hir dremes shul nat been y-told for me;  
Ful were hir hedcs of fumositec,  
That causeth dreem, of which ther nis no charge.  
They slepen til that it was pryme large,  
The moste part, but it were Canacee;  
She was ful mesurable, as wommen be.

For of hir fader hadde she take leve  
To gon to reste, sone after it was eve;  
Hir liste nat appalled for to be,  
Nor on the morwe unfestlich for to see;  
And slepte hir firste sleep, and thanne awook.

For swich a joye she in hir herte took  
Both of hir queynte ring and hir mirour,  
That twenty tyme she changed hir colour;  
And in hir slepe, right for impressioun  
Of hir mirour, she hadde a visioun.

Wherfore, er that the sonne gan up glyde,  
She cleped on hir maistresse hir bisyde,  
And seyde, that hir liste for to ryse.

Thise olde wommen that been gladly wyse  
As is hir maistresse, answerde hir anoon,  
And seyde, “madame, whider wil ye goon  
Thus erly? for the folk ben alle on reste.”

“I wol,” quod she, “aryse, for me leste  
No lenger for to slepe, and walke aboute.”  
Hir maistresse clepeth wommen a gret route,  
And up they rysen, wel a ten or twelve;  
Up ryseth fresshe Canacee hir-selve,  
As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne,  
That in the Ram is four degrees up-ronne;  
Noon hyer was he, whan she redy was;  
And forth she walketh esily a pas.

Arrayed after the lusty seson sote,  
Lightly, for to pleye and walke on fote;  
Nat but with fyve or six of hir meynee;  
And in a trench, forth in the park, goth she.

The vapour, which that fro the erthe glood,  
Made the sonne to seme rody and brood;  
But nathelees, it was so fair a sighte  
That it made alle hir hertes for to lighte.  
What for the seson and the morweninge,  
And for the foules that she herde singe:  
For right anon she wiste what they mente  
Right by hir song, and knew al hir entente.

The knotte, why that every tale is told,  
If it be taried til that lust be cold  
Of hem that han it after herkned yore,  
The savour passeth ever lenger the more,  
For fulsomnesse of his prolixitee.  
And by the same reson thinketh me,  
I sholde to the knotte condescende,  
And maken of hir walking sone an ende.

Amidde a tree fordrye, as whyt as chalk,  
As Canacee was pleying in hir walk,  
Ther sat a faucon over hir heed ful hye,  
That with a pitous voys so gan to crye  
That all the wode resouned of hir cry.

---

They thanked him, gaping all, by two, by three,  
And every one began to go to rest,  
As sleep them bade; they took it for the best.

But here their dreams shall not by me be said;  
The fumes of wine had filled each person’s head,  
Which causeth senseless dream, of which there’s no charge.

They slept until the hour of prime,  
The most part, but it were Canacee;  
She was full temperate, as women be.

For of her father had she taken leave  
To go to rest, soon after it was eve;  
For neither pale nor languid would she be,  
Nor on the morrow wear an unfestlich see;  
And slept her first sleep, and then awook.

For so much joy she in her heart had took  
Both of her quaint ring and her mirror,  
That twenty times she changed her colour;  
And in her sleep, right for impression  
Of her mirror, she had a vision.

Wherefore, ere that the sun gan up glide,  
She called on her mistress sleeping beside,  
And said that her list for to rise.

These old women that be glad and wise  
As is her mistress, answered her anon,  
And said, “Madam, whither will ye goon  
Thus early? for the folk be all on rest.”

“I will,” quod she, “arise, for me list  
No longer for to sleep, and walk about.”  
Her mistress called women a great rout,  
And up they risen, well a ten or twelve;  
Up riseth fresh Canacee herself,  
As ruddy and bright as doth the young sun  
That in the Ram is four degrees up-run;  
No higher was he when she was ready;  
And forth she walketh easily a pace.

Arrayed after the lusty season sweet,  
Lightly, for to play and walk on foot;  
Not but with five or six of her company;  
And in a trench, forth in the park, goes she.

The vapour which that from the earth glowed  
Made the sun to seem ruddy and broad;  
But nevertheless it was so fair a sight  
That it made all their hearts for to light.  
What for the season and the fair morning,  
And for the birds that she heard sing;  
For right anon she wist what they meant  
Right by their song, and knew all their intent.

The point of every story, why 'tis told,  
If it be tarried till that lust be cold  
Of them that have it after heard yore,  
The savour passeth ever more and more,  
For fulsomeness of its prolixity.  
And by the same reason thinketh me  
I should to the point descend, and be  
To make of their walking soon an end.

Amid a tree half-dry, as white as chalk,  
While Canacee was sporting in her walk,  
There sat a falcon over her head full high  
That with a pitiful voice gan to cry  
Till all the wood resounded of her cry.

---

For she had beaten herself so pitiably  
With both her wings that the red glistening blood  
Ran down the tree-trunk whereupon she stood.

And ever in one same way she cried and shrieked,  
And with her beak her body she so pricked  
That there's no tiger, nor a cruel beast  
That dwells in open wood or deep forest,  
That would not have wept, if ever weep he could,  
For pity of her; she shrieked alway so loud.

For never yet has been a man alive—  
If but description I could well contrive—  
That heard of such a falcon for fairness,  
As well of plumage as of nobleness  
Of shape, and all that reckoned up might be.

A falcon peregrine she was, and she  
Seemed from a foreign land; and as she stood  
She fainted now and then for loss of blood,  
Till almost she had fallen from the tree.

This king's fair daughter, Princess Canace,  
Who on her finger bore the magic ring  
Whereby she understood well everything  
That any bird might in his language say,  
And in such language could reply straightway,  
She understood well what this falcon said,  
And of her pity well-nigh was she dead.

So to the tree she went right hastily,  
And on this falcon looked she pitifully,  
And held her lap up wide, for she knew now  
The falcon must come falling from the bough  
When next it swooned away for lack of blood.

A long while waiting there the princess stood,  
Till at the last she spoke, in her voice clear,  
Unto the hawk, as you'll hereafter hear.

“What is the cause, if it be one to tell,  
That you are in this furious pain of hell?”  
Said Canace unto this hawk above.

“Is this for sorrow of death or loss of love?  
For, as I think, these are the causes two  
That torture gentle heart with greatest woe;  
Of other ills there is no need to speak,  
Because such harm upon yourself you wreak;  
Which proves right well that either love or dread  
Must be the reason for your cruel deed,  
Since I can see no one that gives you chase.

For love of God, come, do yourself some grace,  
Or say what thing may help; for west nor east  
Have I before now seen a bird or beast  
That ever treated self so wretchedly.  
You slay me with your sorrow, verily,  
Such great compassion in my heart has grown.

For God's dear love, come from the dry tree down,  
And, as I am a monarch's daughter true,  
If I but verily the real cause knew  
Of your distress, if it lay in my might,  
I would make you amends before the night,  
As truly help me God of human kind!  
And even now will I look out and find  
Some herbs to heal your hurts with, speedily.”

Then shrieked this falcon more piteously  
Than ever, and to ground fell down anon,  
And lay there, swooning, deathlike as a stone,  
Till Canace within her lap did take  
And hold the bird till she began to wake.  
And when from out her fainting list she made,  
All in her own hawk’s language thus she said:

“That pity wells up soon in gentle heart,  
Feeling its likeness in pains that smart,  
Is proved, and day by day, as men may see,  
As well by deed as by authority;  
For gentle heart can kyndly gentleness:  
I see well that ye have of my distress  
Compassion, my fair Canacee,  
Of veray womanly benignitee  
That nature in your principles hath set.

But for no hope for to fare the bet,  
But for to obey unto your heart free,  
And for to maken other be ware by me,  
As by the whelp chasted is the leoun,  
Right for that cause and that conclusion,  
While that I have a leisure and a space,  
Mine harm I will confess, ere I pace.”

And ever, while that one her sorrow told,  
That other wept, as she to water would,  
Till that the falcon bad her to be stifle;  
And, with a syk, right thus she seyde hir wille.

“Ther I was bred (alas! that hard day!)  
And fostred in a roche of marble gray  
So tenderly, that nothing eyled me,  
I niste not what was adversitee,  
Til I coude flee ful hye under the sky.

Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by,  
That semed welle of alle gentillesse;  
Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse,  
It was so wrapped under humble chere,  
And under hewe of trouthe in swich manere,  
Under plesance, and under bisy peyne,  
That no wight coude han wend he coude feyne.

So depe in greyn he dyed his coloures,  
Right as a serpent hit him under floures  
Til he may seen his tyme for to byte.  
Right so this god of love, this ypocrite,  
Doth so his ceremonies and obeisaunces,  
And kepeth in semblant alle his observances  
That sowneth in-to gentillesse of love.

As in a tombe is al the faire above,  
And under is the corps, swich as ye woot,  
Swich was this ypocrite, bothe cold and hoot.  
And in this wise he served his entente,  
That (save the feend) non wiste what he mente.

Til he so longe had wopen and compleyned,  
And many a yeer his service to me feyned,  
Til that myn herte, to pitous and to nyce,  
Al innocent of his crowned malice,  
For-fered of his deeth, as thoughte me,  
Upon his othes and his seuretee,  
Graunted him love, on this condicion,  
That evermore myn honour and renoun  
Were saved, bothe privee and apert;  
This is to seyn, that, after his desert,  
I yaf him al myn herte and al my thoght —  
God woot, and he, that otherwyse noght —  
And took his herte in chaunge for myn for ay.

But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many a day,  
A true man and a thief think not at one.

And when he saw the thing so far was gone  
That I had fully granted him my love,  
In such a wise as I have said above,  
And given him my faithful heart as free  
As he had sworn he had given his to me,  
Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,  
Fell on his knees, devout in humbleness,  
With so high reverence, and, by his face,  
So like a lover in his gentle grace,  
So ravished, as it seemed, for very joy,  
That never Jason nor Paris of Troy—  
Jason? Nay, truly, nor another man  
Since Lamech lived, who was the first began  
To love two women (those that write have sworn),  
Not ever, since the primal man was born,  
Could any man, by twenty-thousandth part,  
Enact the tricks of this deceiver’s art;  
Nor were he worthy to unlace his shoe.

Where double-dealing or deceit were due,  
Nor could so thank a person as he me!  
His manner was most heavenly to see,  
For any woman, were she ever so wise;  
So painted he, and combed, at point-device,  
His manner, all in all, and every word.  
And so much by his bearing was I stirred  
And for the truth I thought was in his heart,  
That, if aught troubled him and made him smart,  
Though ever so little bit, and I knew this,  
It seemed to me I felt death’s cruel kiss.

And briefly, so far all these matters went,  
My will became his own will’s instrument;  
That is to say, my will obeyed his will  
In everything in reason, good or ill,  
Keeping within the bounds of honour ever.

Never had I a thing so dear—ah, never!—  
As him, God knows! nor ever shall anew.

This lasted longer than a year or two  
While I supposed of him no thing but good.  
But finally, thus at the last it stood,  
That Fortune did decree that he must win  
Out of that place, that home, that I was in.  
Whether I felt woe, there’s no question, none;  
I can't describe my feelings, no, not one;  
But one thing dare I tell, and that boldly,  
I came to know the pain of death thereby;  
Such grief I felt for him, none might believe.

So on a day of me he took his leave,  
So sorrowfully, too, I thought truly  
That he felt even as deep a woe as I,  
When I had heard him speak and saw his hue.  
Nevertheless, I thought he was so true,

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

And that to me he would come back again  
Within a little while, let me explain;

And ’twas quite reasonable that he must go  
For honour’s sake, for oft it happens so,

That I made virtue of necessity,  
And took it well, because it had to be.

A look of cheer I felt not; I put on  
And took his hand, I swear it by Saint John,  
And said to him: “Behold, I’m yours in all;  
Be you to me as I have been, and shall.”

## THE SQUIRE’S TALE

[10,913–10,974]

What he answerde, it nedeth nought reherse;  
Who can say better than he, who can do worse?  
Whan he hath al wel sayd, thanne hath he doon.  
“Therfor bihoveth him a ful long spoon  
That shal ete with a feend,” thus herde I seye.

So atte laste he moste forth his weye,  
And forth he fleeth, til he cam ther him leste.  
Whan it cam him to purpos for to reste,  
I trowe he hadde thilke text in minde,

That “alle thing, repeiring to his kinde,  
Gladeth him-self;” thus seyn men, as I gesse;  
Men loven of propre kinde newfangelnesse,  
As briddes doon that men in cages fede.

For though thou night and day take of hem hede,  
And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk,  
And yeve hem sugur, hony, breed and milk,  
Yet right anon, as that his dore is uppe,

He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe,  
And to the wode he wol and wormes ete;  
So newefangel been they of hir mete,  
And loven noveiryes of propre kinde;

No gentillesse of blood ne may hem binde.  
So ferde this tercelet, alass the day!  
Though he were gentil bom, and fresh and gay,  
And goodly for to seen, and humble and free.

He saugh up-on a tyme a kyte flee,  
And sodeynly he loved this kyte so,  
That al his love is clene fro me ago,  
And hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse;

Thus hath the kyte my love in hir servyse,  
And I am lorn with-outen remedye!”  
And with that word this faucon gan to crye,  
And swooned eft in Canacee’s barm.

Greet was the sorwe, for the haukes harme,  
That Canacee and alle hir wommen made:  
They niste how they mighte the faucon glade.  
But Canacee home bereth hir in hir lappe,

And softly in poultices gan hir wrappe,  
Ther as she with hir beek had hurt hirselve.  
Now can nat Canacee but herbes delve  
Out of the grounde, and make salves newe

Of herbes precious, and fyne of hewe,  
To helen with this hauk; fro day to night  
She dooth hir bisinesse and al hir might.  
And by hir beddes heed she made a mewe,

And covered it with velvets blewe,  
In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.  
And al with-oute, the mewe is peynted grene,  
In which were peynted alle thise false foules,

As bef these titmice, tercelets, and oules,  
Right for despyt were peynted hem bisyde;  
And pyes, on hem for to crye and chyde.  
Thus lete I Canacee hir hauk keping;

I wol na-more as now speke of hir ring,  
Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn  
How that this faucon gat hir love ageyn repentant,  
As the storie telieth us, by mediacioun

Of Cambalus, the kinges sone, of whiche I tolde.  
But hennes-forth I wol my proces holde  
To speke of aventures and of batailles,  
That never yet was herd so grete mervailles.

---

What he replied, it needs not I rehearse,  
Who can say better than he, who can do worse?  
When he had well said, all his good was done.  
“It well behooves him take a long spoon  
Who eats with devils,” so I’ve heard folk say.

So at the last he must be on his way.  
And forth he flew to where it pleased him best.  
When it became his purpose he should rest,  
I think he must have had this text in mind,

That “Everything, returning to its kind,  
Gladdens itself”; thus men say, as I guess;  
Men love, and naturally, newfangledness,  
As do these birds that men in cages feed.

For though you night and day take of them heed,  
And fairly strew their cage as soft as silk,  
And give them sugar, honey, bread, and milk,  
Yet on the instant when the door is up,

They with their feet will spurn their feeding cup,  
And to the wood will fly and worms will eat;  
So are they all newfangled of their meat,  
And love all novelties of their own kind;

Nor gentleness of blood may ever bind.  
So fared this tercelet — oh, alas the day!  
Though he was gently born, and fresh and gay,  
And handsome, and well-mannered, brave and free,

He saw a kite fly, and it proved a she;  
And suddenly he loved this she-kite so  
That all his love for me did quickly go,  
And all his truth turned falsehood in this wise;

Thus has this kite my love in her service,  
And I am love-lorn without remedy.”  
And with that word the hawk began to cry,  
And after swooned on Canacee’s fair arm.

Great was the sorrow for the falcon’s harm  
That Canacee and all her women made;  
They knew not how they might this falcon aid.  
But Canacee home bore her in her lap,

And softly her in poultices did wrap  
Where she with her own beak had hurt herself.  
Now Canacee dug herbs more rich than pelf  
Out of the ground, and made up ointments new

Of precious herbs, all beautiful of hue,  
Wherewith to heal this hawk; from day to night  
She nursed her carefully with all her might.  
And by her bed’s head she contrived a mew,

And lined the cage with velvets all of blue,  
Symbol of truth that is in women seen.  
And all without, the mew was painted green,  
And there were painted all these treacherous fowls,

As are these titmice, tercelets, and these owls,  
While, for despite, were painted there beside  
Magpies, that they might cry at them and chide.  
Thus leave I Canacee her hawk keeping;

I will no more, just now, speak of her ring,  
Till I come back with purpose to explain  
How this poor falcon got her love again repentant,  
By mediation of that Cambalus,

The king’s son, of whom I’ve already told.  
But henceforth I a straightened course will hold  
And tell of great battles and adventures,  
Whereof were never heard such marvels great.

---

First will I tell you of King Cambinskan,  
Who won so many a town and many a man;  
And after will I speak of Algarsyf,  
How he won Theodora to his wife,

For whom full oft in great peril he was,  
Had he not been helped by the steed of brass;  
And after that I’ll speak of Cambalo,  
Who in the lists fought with the brothers two

For Canacee, ere that he might her win.  
And where I left off, I’ll again begin.

[10,975–11,020]

First wol I telle yow of Cambinskan,  
That in his tyme many a citee wan;  
And after wol I speke of Algarsyf,  
How that he wan Theodora to his wyf,

For whom ful ofte in greet peril he was,  
Ne hadde he ben holpen by the stede of bras;  
And after wol I speke of Cambalo,  
That faught in listes with the bretheren two

For Canacee, er that he mighte hir winne.  
And ther I lefte I wol ageyn biginne.

HERE FOLLOWETH THE WORDS OF THE FRANKLIN TO THE SQUIRE, AND THE WORDS OF

“In faith, sir Squire, you have done well with it,  
And openly I praise you for your wit,”  
The franklin said, “Considering your youth,  
So feelingly you speak, sir, in good truth!

In my opinion, there is none that’s here  
In eloquence shall ever be your peer,  
If you but live; may God give you good chance  
And in all virtue send continuance!

For, sir, your speech was great delight to me.  
I have a son, and by the Trinity  
I’d rather have, than twenty pounds in land,  
Though it were right now fallen to my hand,

He were a man of such discretion shown  
As you, sir; fie on what a man may own,  
Unless the man have virtue therewithal.  
I’ve checked my son, and yet again I shall,

For he toward virtue chooses not to wend;  
But just to play at dice, and gold to spend,  
And lose all that he has, is his usage,  
And he would rather talk with any page

Than to commune with any gentle wight  
From whom he might learn courtesy aright.”

“A straw for courtesy!” exclaimed our host;  
“What, franklin? God, sir, well you know, I trust,  
That each of you must tell us, at the least,  
A tale or two, or break his sworn behest.”

“I know it,” said the franklin; “I am fain,  
And pray you all, you do not me disdain,  
Though to this man I speak a word or two.”  
“Come, tell your tale, sir, without more ado.”

“Gladly, sir host,” said he, “I will obey  
Your will, good host; now hearken what I say.  
For I’ll not be contrary in any wise,  
At least so far as my wit shall suffice;

I pray to God that it may please you; rough  
Though it may be, I’ll know ’tis good enough.”

“In feith, Squier, thou hast thee wel y-quit.  
And gentilly I preise wel thy wit,”

Quod the Frankeleyn, “considering thy youthe.  
So feelingly thou spekest, sir, I allow thee!

As to my doom, there is non that is here  
Of eloquence that shal be thy pere,  
If that thou live; God yeve thee good chaunce,  
And in vertu sende thee continuaunce!

For of thy speche I have greet deyntee.  
I have a sone, and, by the Trinitee,  
I hadde lever than twenty pound worth lond,  
Though it right now were fallen in myn hond.
He were a man of swich discrecioun
As that ye been! fy on possessioun,
But-if a man be vertuous with-al.

I have my sone snibbed, and yet shal,  
For he to vertu listeth nat entende;  
But for to pleye at dees, and to despende,  
And lese al that he hath, is his usage.

And he hath lever talken with a page  
Than to comune with any gentil wight  
Ther he mighte lerne gentillesse aright.”

“Straw for your gentillesse,” quod our host;  
“What, Frankeleyn? Pardee, sir, wel thou wost  
That eche of yow mot tellen atte leste  
A tale or two, or breken his biheste.”

“That knowe I wel, sir,” quod the Frankeleyn;  
“I prey yow, haveth me nat in desdeyn  
Though to this man I speke a word or two.”

“Telle on thy tale with-outen wordes mo.”  
“Gladly, sir host,” quod he, “I wol obeye  
Un-to your wil; now herkneth what I seye,

I wol yow nat contrarien in no wyse  
As fer as that my wittes wol suffyse;  
I prey to God that it may plesen yow,  
Than woot I wel that it is good y-now.”

## THE FRANKLIN’S PROLOGUE

Thise olde gentil Britons in hir dayes  
Of diverse aventures maden layes,  
Rymeyed in hir firste Briton tonge;  
Which layes with hir instruments they songe.  
Or elles redden hem for hir plesaunce;  
And oon of hem have I in remembraunce.  
Which I shal seyn with good wil as I can.

But, sires, by-cause I am a burel man,  
At my biginning first I yow biseche  
Have me excused of my rude speche;  
I lerned never rethoryk certeyn;  
Thing that I speke, it moot be bare and pleyn.  
I sleep never on the mount of Parnaso,  
Ne lerned Marcus Tullius Cicero.

Colours ne knowe I none, with-outen drede,  
But swiche colours as growen in the mede,  
Or elles swiche as men dye or peynte.  
Colours of rethoryk ben me to queynte;  
My spirit feleth noght of swich matere.  
But if yow list, my tale shul ye here.

“These ancient gentle Bretons, in their days,  
Of divers high adventures made great lays  
And rhymed them in their primal Breton tongue;  
The which lays to their instruments they sung,  
Or else recited them where joy might be;  
And one of them have I in memory,  
Which I shall gladly tell you, as I can.

But, sirs, because I am an ignorant man,  
At my beginning must I first beseech  
You will excuse me for my vulgar speech;  
I never studied rhetoric, that’s certain;  
That which I say, it must be bare and plain.  
I never slept on Mount Parnassus, no,  
Nor studied Marcus Tullius Cicero.

Colours I know not, there’s no doubt indeed,  
Save colours such as grow within the mead,  
Or such as men achieve with dye or paint.  
Colours of rhetoric I find but quaint;  
My spirit doesn’t feel the beauty there.  
But if you wish, my story you shall hear.”

HERE BEGINNETH THE FRANKLIN’S TALE

In Armorik, that called is Britayne,  
Ther was a knight that loved and dide his payne  
To serve a lady in his beste wyse;  
And many a labour, many a greet empryse  
He for his lady wroghte, er she were wonne.

For she was oon, the faireste under sonne,  
And eek therto come of so heigh kinrede,  
That wel unnethes dorste this knight, for drede,  
Telle hir his wo, his peyne, and his distresse.

But atte laste, she, for his worthinesse,  
And namely for his meke obeysaunce,  
Hath swich a pitee caught of his penunce,  
That prively she fil of his accord  
To take him for hir housbonde and hir lord,

Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves;  
And for to lede the more in blisse hir lyves.  
Of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight,  
That never in al his lyf he, day ne night,  
Ne sholde up-on him take no maistrye  
Agayn hir wil, ne kythe hir jalousye,

But hir obeye, and folwe hir wil in al  
As any lovere to his lady shal;  
Save that the name of soveraynetee  
That wolde he have for shame of his degree.

She thanked him, and with ful greet humblesse  
She seyde, “Sire, sith of your gentillesse  
Ye profre me to have so large a reyne,  
Ne wolde never God bitwixe us tweyne

For any guilt of mine, a war or strite.  
Sir, I wol be your humble, trewe wyf,  
Have heer my trouthe, til that myn herte breste.”  
Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.

For o thing, sires, safly dar I seye,  
That frendes everich other moot obeye,  
If they wol longe holden companye.  
Love wol nat ben constreyned by maistrye;

Whan maistrie comth, the god of love anon  
Beteth hise winges, and farewell he is gon!  
Love is a thing as any spirit free;  
Wommen of kinde desiren libertee,

And nat to ben constreyned as a thral;  
And so don men, if I soth seyen shal.  
Loke who that is most pacient in love,  
He is at his avantage al above.

Pacience is an heigh vertu certeyn;  
For it venquisseth, as thise clerkes seyn,  
Thinges that rigour sholde never atteync.  
For every word men may nat chyde or pleyne;  
Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon,  
Ye shul it lerne, wher-so ye wole or noon.

For in this world, certain, ther no wight is,  
That he ne dooth or seith som-tyme amis.  
Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun,  
Wyn, wo, or chaunginge of complexioun  
Causeth ful oftc to doon amis or speken.

On every wrong a man may nat be wreken;  
After the tyme, moste be temperaunce  
To every wight that can on governaunce.  
And therfore hath this wyse worthy knight

To live in ese, suffrance hir bihight,  
And she to him ful wisely gan to swerc  
That never sholde ther be defaute in here.  
Heer may men seen an humble wys accord;

Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord,  
Servant in love, and lord in mariage;  
Than was he bothe in lordship and servage;  
Servage? nay, but in lordshipe above,

Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love;  
His lady, certes, and his wyf also,  
The which that lawe of love acordeth to.  
And whan he was in this prosperitee,

Home with his wyf he gooth to his contree,  
Nat fer fro Penmark, ther his dwelling was,  
Wher-as he liveth in blisse and in solas.  
Who coude telle, but he had wedded be,

The joye, the ese, and the prosperitee  
That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?  
A yeer and more lasted this blisful lyf,  
Til that the knight of which I speke of thus,

That of Kairrudd was cleped Arveragus,  
Shoop him to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweyne  
In Engelond, that cleped was eek Britayne,  
To seke in armes worship and honour;

For al his lust he sette in swich labour;  
And dwelled ther two yeer, the book seith thus.  
Now wol I stint of this Arveragus,  
And speken I wol of Dorigen his wyf,

That loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf;  
For his absence wexeth she and siketh,  
As doon this noble wyves whan hem lyketh.  
She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth;

Desyr of his presence hir so distreyneth,  
That al this wyde world she sette at noght.  
Hir frendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,  
Conforten hir in al that ever they may;

They prechen hir, they telle hir night and day,  
That causeles she sleeth hir-self, alass!  
And every confort possible in this cas  
They doon to hir with al hir bisinesse,

Al for to make hir leve hir hevinesse.  
By proces, as ye knowen everichoon,  
Men may so longe graven in a stoon,  
Til som figure ther-inne emprented be.

So longe han they conforted hir, til she  
Receyved hath, by hope and by resoun,  
Th’emprenting of hir consolacioun,  
Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;  
She may nat alwey duren in swich rage.

And eek Arveragus, in al this care,  
Hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare,  
And that he wol come hastily agayn;  
Or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.

Hir frendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake,  
And preyeden hir on knees, for Goddes sake,  
To come and romen hir in companye,  
Awey to dryve hir derke fantasye.

And finally she graunted that requeste;  
For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.  
Now stood hir castel faste by the see,  
And often with hir frendes walketh she

Hir to disporte upon the bank an heigh,  
Wher-as she many a ship and barge seigh  
Sailing hir cours, wher-as hem liste go;  
But than was that a parcel of hir wo.

For to hir-self ful ofte “alass!” seith she,  
“Is ther no ship, of so many as I see,  
Wol bringe hom my lord? than were myn herte  
Al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte.”

Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thinke,  
And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke.  
But whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake,  
For verray fere so wolde hir herte quake,

That on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene.  
Than wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,  
And pitously into the see biholde,  
And seyn right thus, with sorweful sykks colde:

“Eterne God, that thurgh thy purveyaunce  
Ledest the world by certein governaunce,  
In ydel, as men seyn, ye no-thing make;  
But, lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake

That semen rather a foul confusioun  
Of werk than any fair creacioun  
Of swich a parfit wys God and a stable.  
Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?

For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest,  
Ther nis y-fostred man, ne brid, ne beest;  
It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth.  
See ye nat, lord, how mankinde it destroyeth?

An hundred thousand bodies of mankinde  
Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in minde,  
And manye a noble soule, unloved, lost;  
For which this world hath mickle wo and coste.”

## The Franklin’s Tale

### Modern English

That seem'd but rather foul confusion thrown  
Awry than any fair world of Thine own,  
Aye of a perfect, wise God and stable.  
Why hast Thou wrought this insane work, I pray?  
For by this work, north, south, and west and east,  
There is none nurtured, man, nor bird, nor beast;  
It does no good, to my mind, but ever annoys.  
Seest Thou not, Lord, how mankind it destroys?  
A hundred thousand bodies of mankind  
Have died on rocks, whose names are not in mind.

And man's a creature made in Thee most fair,  
After Thine image, as Thou didst declare.  
Then seemed it that Thou hadst great charity  
Toward mankind; but how then may it be  
That Thou hast wrought such means man to destroy,  
Which means do never good, but ever annoy?  
I know well clerks will gladly so attest,  
By arguments that all is for the best,  
Though I can never the real causes know.  
But O Thou God who made the wind to blow,  
Keep Thou my lord! This is my argument;  
To clerks I leave disputing on what's meant.  
But O would God that all these rocks so black  
Were sunken down to Hell for my lord's sake!  
These rocks, they slay my very heart with fear."  
Thus would she say, with many a piteous tear.

Her friends saw that to her it was no sport  
To wander by the sea, but discomfort;  
And so they arranged to revel somewhere else.  
They led her along rivers and to wells,  
And to such other places delightful;  
They told of fables, and they danced and played  
At chess, and at the tables.  

So on a day, all in the morning-tide,  
Unto a garden which was there beside,  
Wherein they had given charge that there should be  
Food and whatever else was necessary,  
They went for pleasure all the livelong day.  
And this was on the sixth morning of May,  
And May had painted with his soft warm showers  
This garden full of foliage and of flowers;  
And craft of man's hand had so curiously  
Arrayed this lovely garden truthfully,  
That never was there garden of such price,  
But if it were the very Paradise.

The odour of flowers and the fresh fair sight  
Would have made any heart to leap for delight  
That ever was born, unless too great sickness  
Or too great sorrow held it in distress;  
So full it was of beauty and of pleasance.  
After their dinner all began to dance,  
And sing, also—save Dorigen alone—  
Who made alway her same complaint and moan;  
For she ne saw him on the dance to go,  
That was her husband and her love also.  
Nevertheless she must a time abide,  
And with good hope withheld, let her sorrow slide.

Upon this dance, among other men,  
Danced a squire before this Dorigen,  
That fresher was and jollier of array  
As to my doom than is the month of May.  
He singeth, danceth, passing any man  
That is, or was, since that the world began.  
Therewith he was, if men should him describe,  
One of the best-faring men alive:  
Young, strong, right virtuous, and rich and wise,  
And well beloved, and holden in great prize.  
And shortly, if the sooth I shall declare,  
Unwitting of this Dorigen at all,  
This lusty squire, servant to Venus,

The name of whom was Aurelius,  
Had loved her best of any one alive  
Two years and more (since first she did arrive);  
But never dared he tell her of his state;  
Without a cup he drank his draught of fate.  
He had despaired, for nothing dared he say;  
Save that in songs he somewhat would betray  
His woe, as of a general complaint:  
He said he loved, and was by none beloved.

Of such a matter made he many lays,  
Songs, complaints, rondeels, virelays,  
How that he dorst not his sorrow tell,  
But languished, as a fury in hell;  
And die he must, he said, as did Echo  
For Narcissus, that durst not tell her woe.  
In other manner than you hear me say,  
He durst not unto her his woe display;  
Save that, peraventure, sometimes at dances,  
Where young folk keep their observances,  
It may well be he looked upon her face  
In such a wise as one that asks for grace;  
But nothing wist she of his intent.

Nevertheless it happed, ere they thence went,  
Because that he was her neighbour,  
And was a man of worship and of honour,  
And she had known him in the time of yore,  
They fell in speech; and farther and more and more  
Unto his purpose drew Aurelius,  
And when he saw his time he said thus:  
"Madame," quoth he, "by God that this world made,  
So that I wist it might your heart invade,  
I would that day that your Arveragus  
Went over the sea, that I, Aurelius,  
Had gone whence never I should come again;  
For well I wot my service is in vain.  
My guerdon is the breaking of my heart;  
Madame, have pity on my pains that smart;  
For with a word you may me slay or save;  
Here at your feet would God I found my grave!  
Time to say more I have not at present;  
Have mercy, sweet, or you will make me absent!"

She gan to look upon Aurelius:  
"Is this your will?" quoth she, "and say you thus?  
Never erst," quoth she, "knew I what you meant.  
But now, Aurelius, I know your intent:  
By that same God that gave me soul and life,  
Never shall I be untrue unto my wife  
In word nor deed, as far as I have wit;  
I will be his to whom that I am knit;  
Take this for final answer as of me."

But after that in play she thus said she:  
"Aurelius," quoth she, "by God above,  
Yet would I grant you to be my love,  
Since I you see so piteously complain;  
Look what day that, along the coast of Brittany,  
Ye remove all the rocks, stone by stone,  
So that they hinder neither ship nor boat—  
I say, when ye have made the coast so clean  
Of rocks, that there is no stone to be seen,  
Then will I love you best of any man:  
Have here my troth in all that ever I can."

"Is there no other grace in you?" asked he.  
"No, by that Lord," said she, "Who hath me made!  
For well I wot that it shall never betide.  
Let suchlike follies out of your heart slide.  
What pleasure should a man have in his life  
To go and love another man's own wife,  
Who hath her body when so that him liketh?"  
Aurelius full oft then sighed sore;  
Woe was Aurelius when this he heard,  
And with a sorrowful heart he thus answered:  
"Madame," quoth he, "this were impossible!  
Then mote I die of sudden death and fell."  
And with that word he turned him anon and fell.

Then came her other friends, many a one,  
And in the alleys wandered up and down,  
And nothing knew of this decision shown,  
But suddenly began to dance anew  
Until the bright sun lost his golden hue;  
For the horizon had cut off his light;  
This is as much as saying it was night.  
And home they went in joy and with solace,  
Except the wretch Aurelius, alas!  
He to his house went with a woeful heart;  
He saw he could not from his near death part.  
It seemed to him he felt his heart grow cold;  
Up toward Heaven his two hands did he hold,  
And on his bare knees did he kneel him down,  
And in his raving said his orison.  
For very woe out of his wits he fled;  
He knew not what he spake, but thus he said:

With mournful heart his plaint had he begun  
Unto the gods, and first unto the sun.  
He said: "Apollo, governor and god  
Of every plant, herb, tree, and flower in sod,  
That givest, according to thy declination,  
To each of them its time of foliation,  
All as thy habitation’s low or high,  
Lord Phoebus, cast thy merciful bright eye  
On wretched Aurelius, who is lost and lorn.  
Lo, Lord! My lady hath my death sworn,  
Without my guilt; on my dying heart, I pray,  
Have some compassion, Lord, upon my pay!  
For well I know, Lord Phoebus, if you list,  
You can thus aid me, save my lady best.

Now vouchsafe that I may for you devise  
A plan to help me, telling in what wise.  
Your blessed sister, Lucina the serene,  
That of the sea is goddess chief and queen  
(Though Neptune is the deity in the sea,  
Yet empress set above him there is she),  
You know full well, Lord, that just as her desire  
Is to be quickened and lighted by your fire,  
For which she follows you right busily,  
Just so the sea desires, and naturally,  
To follow her, she being higher goddess  
Both of the sea and rivers, great and less.  
Wherefore, Lord Phoebus, this request I make—  
Without this miracle my heart will break—  
That at the time of your next opposition,  
Which will be in the Lion, make petition

To her that she so great a flood shall bring,  
That five fathoms at the least it over-spring  
The highest rock in Armoric, Brittany;  
And let this flood endure two years for me;  
Then certes to my lady may I say:  
'Holdeth your hest, the rocks are gone away.'  
Lord Phoebus, do this miracle for me;  
Pray her she go no faster course than thee;  
I say, pray your sister that she go  
No faster course than you these years two;  
Then shall she be even at the full always,  
And spring-flood last both night and day.

And, but she vouchsafe in such a manner  
To grant me my sovereign lady dear,  
Pray her to sink each rock adown  
Into her own dark region under ground,  
Where Pluto dwelleth ever with his sin.  
Or nevermore shall I my lady win.  
Thy temple in Delphi will I barefoot seek;  
Lord Phoebus, see the tears upon my cheek,  
And of my pain have some compassion."  
And with that word in swoon he fell adown,  
And a long time he lay forth in a trance.  
His brother, who that knew of his penance,  
Upcaught him, and to bed he hath him brought.  
Despaired in this torment and in this thought,  
I let this woeful creature lie;  
Choose he, for me, whether he will live or die.

Arveragus, with health and great honour,  
As he that was of chivalry the flower,  
Is come home, with other worthy men.  
O blissful art thou now, thou Dorigen,  
That hast thy lusty husband in thine arms,  
The fresh knight, the worthy man of arms,  
That loveth thee, as his own heart’s life.  
Nothing lists him to be imaginatif  
If any wight had spoken while he was out  
To her of love; he had of it no doubt.  
He not intendeth to any such matter,  
But dances, jousts, and makes her good cheer;  
And thus in joy and bliss I let them dwell.

And of the sick Aurelius will I tell.  
In languor and in torment furious  
Two years and more lay wretched Aurelius,  
Ere any foot he might on earth goon;  
No comfort in this time had he none,  
Save of his brother, who that was a clerk;  
He knew of all this woe and all this work.  
For to no other creature certain  
Of this matter he dared no word say.  
Under his breast he bore it more secretly  
Than ever did Pamphilus for Galatea.  
His breast was whole, without any wound to be seen;  
But in his heart aye was the arrow keen.

And well ye know that of a sarsen-ure  
In surgery is perilous the cure,  
But men might touch the arrow, or come thereby.  
His brother wept and wailed privily,  
Till at the last he fell in remembrance  
That while he was at Orleans in France—  
For many young clerks are all likerous  
To read of arts that be most curious,  
And to every nook and corner turn  
Particular strange sciences to learn—  
He thus recalled that, upon a day,  
At Orleans while studying there, I say,  
A book of natural magic there he saw  
In a friend's room, a bachelor of law,  
(Although he was there to learn another craft,)  
Which book he'd privately on his desk left;  
And that book said much of the operations  
Touching the eight and twenty variations  
That designate the mansions of the moon, and such folly  
As is, in our days, valued not a fly;  
For Holy Church provides us with a creed  
That suffers no illusion to mislead.

And when this book came to his remembrance,  
Anon, for joy, his heart began to dance,  
And to himself he said in privacy:  
"My brother shall be healed, and speedily;  
For I am sure there are sciences  
Whereby men make divers appearances,  
Such as these prestidigitators play.  
For oft at feasts have I well heard men say  
That jugglers, in a hall both bright and large,  
Have made come in there water and a barge,  
And in the hall the barge rowed up and down;  
Sometimes there seemed to come a grim lion;  
And sometimes flowers sprang as in a mead;  
Or vines with grapes both red and white indeed;  
Sometimes a castle built of lime and stone;  
And when they wished it, it disappeared anon.  
Thus seemed these things to be in every man's sight.

"Now, then, conclude I thus, that if I might  
At Orleans some old school-fellow find,  
Who has these mansions of the moon in mind,  
Or other natural magic from above,  
He could well make my brother have his love.  
For with a mere appearance clerks may make  
It seem in man's sight that all rocks that break  
The seas of Brittany were banished so  
That right above them ships might come and go,  
And in such wise endure a week or two;  
Then were my brother cured of all his woe.  
For she must keep the word she gave at feast,  
Or he'll have right to shame her, at the least."

Why should I make a longer tale of this?  
He to the bedside of his brother went,  
And urged him eagerly to be gone  
To Orleans; he started up anon,  
And forward on his way at once did fare  
In hope to be relieved of all his care.  
When they were come almost to that city,  
Perchance two furlongs short of it or three,  
A young clerk walking by himself they met,  
Who, in good Latin, heartily did greet,  
And after that he said a wondrous thing:  
"I know," said he, "the cause of your coming."  
And ere a further foot the brothers went,  
He told them all the soul of their intent.

This Breton clerk asked after schoolfellows  
Whom he had known through former suns and snows;  
And he answered him that they were died;  
For which he wept full oft many a tear.  
Down of his horse Aurelius lighted anon,  
And forth with this magician is he gone  
Home to his house, and made them well at ease.  
They lacked no victual that might them please;  
So well arrayed a house as there was one  
Aurelius in his life saw never none.

He showed him, ere he went to supper,  
Forests, parks full of wild deer;  
There saw he hartes with their homes high,  
The greatest that ever were seen with eye.  
He saw of them an hundred slain with hounds,  
And some with arrows bleeding of bitter wounds.  
He saw, when voided were this wild deer,  
These falconers upon a fair river,  
That with their hawks have the heron slain.  
Then saw he knights justing in a plain;  
And after this he did him such pleasure,
  
### Middle English (Original)

Which mankinde is so fair part of thy werk  
That thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk.  
Than semed it ye hadde a greet chiertce  
Toward mankinde; but how than may it be  
That ye swiche menes make it to destroyen,  
Whiche menes do no good, but ever anoyen?

I woot wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste,  
By arguments, that al is for the beste,  
Though I ne can the causes nat y-knowe.  
But thilke god, that made wind to blowe,  
As kepe my lord! this my conclusioun;  
To clerkes lete I al disputisoun.  
But wolde god that alle thise rokkes blake  
Were sonken in-to helle for his sake!  
Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the fere."  
Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous tere.

Hir freendes sawe that it was no disport  
To romen by the see, but disconfort;  
And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles.  
They leden hir by riveres and by welles,  
And eek in othere places delitables;  
They dauncen, and they pleyen at ches and tables.

So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,  
Un-to a gardin that was ther bisyde,  
In which that they had maad hir ordinaunce  
Of vitaille and of other purveyaunce,  
They goon and pleyen hem al the longe day.  
And this was on the sixte morwe of May,  
Which May had peynted with his softe shoures  
This gardin ful of leves and of floures;  
And craft of mannes hand so curiously  
Arrayed hadde this gardin, trewely,  
That never was ther gardin of swich prys,  
But-if it were the verray paradys.

Th'odour of floures and the fresshe sighte  
Wolde han maad any herte for to lighte  
That ever was born, but-if to gret siknesse  
Or to gret sorwe helde it in distresse;  
So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.

At-after diner gonne they to daunce,  
And singe also, save Dorigen allone,  
Which made alwey hir compleint and hir mone;  
For she ne saugh him on the daunce go,  
That was hir housbonde and hir love also.  
But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde,  
And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.

Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,  
Daunced a squyer biforen Dorigen,  
That fressher was and jolyer of array  
As to my doom, than is the monthe of May.  
He singeth, daunceth, passinge any man  
That is, or was, sith that the world bigan.  
Ther-with he was, if men sholde him discryve,  
Oon of the beste faringe man on-lyve;  
Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche and wys,  
And wel biloved, and holden in gret prys.

And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal,  
Unwiting of this Dorigen at al,  
This lusty squyer, servant to Venus,

Which that y-cleped was Aurelius,  
Had loved hir best of any creature  
Two yeer and more, as was his aventure,  
But never dorste he telle hir his grevaunce;  
With-outen coppe he drank al his penaunce.

He was despeyred, no-thing dorste he seye,  
Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye  
His wo, as in a general compleyning;  
He seyde he lovede, and was biloved nothing.  
Of swich matere made he manye layes,  
Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,  
How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,  
But languissheth, as a furie dooth in helle;  
And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko  
For Narcissus, that dorste nat telle hir wo.

In other manere than ye here me seye,  
Ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye;  
Save that, paraventure, somtyme at daunces,  
Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,  
It may wel be he loked on hir face  
In swich a wyse, as man that asketh grace;  
But no-thing wiste she of his entente.

Nathelees, it happed, er they thennes wente,  
By cause that he was hir neighbour,  
And was a man of worship and honour,  
And hadde y-knowen him of tyme yore,  
They fille in speche; and forth more and more  
Un-to his purpos drough Aurelius,  
And whan he saugh his tyme, he seyde thus:

"Madame," quod he, "by God that this world made,  
So that I wiste it mighte your herte glade,  
I wolde, that day that your Arveragus  
Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,  
Had went ther never I sholde have come agayn;  
For wel I woot my service is in vayn.  
My guerdon is but bresting of myn herte;  
Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte;  
For with a word ye may me sleen or save,  
Heer at your feet God wolde that I were grave!  
I ne have as now no leyser more to seye;  
Have mercy, swete, or ye wol do me deye!"

She gan to loke upon Aurelius:  
"Is this your wil?" quod she, "and sey ye thus?  
Never erst," quod she, "ne wiste I what ye mente.  
But now, Aurelie, I knowe your entente,  
By thilke god that yaf me soule and lyf,  
Ne shal I never been untrewe wyf  
In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit:  
I wol ben his to whom that I am knit;  
Tak this for fynal answer as of me."

But after that in pley thus seyde she:  
"Aurelie," quod she, "by heighe god above,  
Yet wolde I graunte yow to been your love,  
Sin I yow see so pitously complayne;  
Loke what day that, endelong Britayne,  
Ye remove alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon,  
That they ne lette ship ne boot to goon—  
I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so clene  
Of rokkes, that ther nis no stoon y-sene,  
Than wol I love yow best of any man;  
Have heer my trouthe in al that ever I can."

"Is ther non other grace in yow?" quod he.  
"No, by that lord," quod she, "that maked me!  
For wel I woot that it shal never bityde.  
Lat swich folies out of your herte slyde.  
What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf  
For to go love another mannes wyf,  
That hath hir body whan so that him lyketh?"  
Aurelius ful ofte sore syketh;  
Wo was Aurelie, whan that he this herde,  
And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:

"Madame," quod he, "this were an impossible!  
Than moot I dye of sodein deth horrible."  
And with that word he turned him anoon.

Tho come hir othere freendes many oon,  
And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,  
And no-thing wiste of this conclusioun,  
But sodeinly bigonne revel newe  
Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe;  
For th'orisonte hath reft the sonne his light;  
This is as muche to seye as it was night.  
And hoom they goon in joye and in solas,  
Save only wrecche Aurelius, alasse!  
He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte;  
He seeth he may nat fro his deth asterte.  
Him semed that he felte his herte colde;  
Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde,  
And on his knowes bare he sette him doun,  
And in his raving seyde his orisoun.  
For verray wo out of his wit he breyde.  
He niste what he spak, but thus he seyde:

With pitous herte his pleynt hath he bigonne  
Un-to the goddes, and first un-to the sonne:  
He seyde, "Apollo, god and governour  
Of every plaunte, herbe, tree and flour,  
That yevest, after thy declinacioun,  
To ech of hem his tyme and his sesoun,  
As thy herberwe chaungeth lowe or hye,  
Lord Phebus, cast thy merciable ye  
On wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn.  
Lo, lord! my lady hath my deeth y-swom  
With-oute gilt, but thy benignitee  
Upon my dedly herte have some pitee!  
For wel I woot, lord Phebus, if yow lest,  
Ye may me helpen, save my lady, best.

Now voucheth sauf that I may yow devyse  
How that I may been holpe and in what wyse.  
Your blisful suster, Lucina the shene,  
That of the see is chief goddesse and quene,  
Though Neptunus have deitee in the see,  
Yet emperesse aboven him is she:  
Ye knowen wel, lord, that right as hir desyr  
Is to be quiked and lightned of your fyr,  
For which she folweth yow ful bisily,  
Right so the see desyreth naturelly  
To folwen hir, as she that is goddesse  
Bothe in the see and riveres more and lesse.  
Wherfore, lord Phebus, this is my requeste—  
Do this miracle, or do myn herte breste—  
That now, next at this opposicioun,  
Which in the signe shal be of the Leoun,

As preyeth hir so greet a flood to bringe,  
That fyve fadme at the leeste it overspringe  
The hyeste rokke in Armorik Britayne;  
And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne;  
Than certes to my lady may I seye:  
'Holdeth your heste, the rokkes been aweye.'  
Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me;  
Preye hir she go no faster cours than ye;  
I seye, preyeth your suster that she go  
No faster cours than ye thise yeres two;  
Than shal she been evene atte fulle alway,  
And spring-flood laste bothe night and day.

And but she vouche-sauf in swiche manere  
To graunte me my sovereyn lady dere,  
Prey hir to sinken every rok adoun  
In-to hir owene derke regioun  
Under the ground, ther Pluto dwelleth inne;  
Or never-mo shal I my lady winne.  
Thy temple in Delphos wol I barefoot seke;  
Lord Phebus, see the teres on my cheke,  
And of my peyne have som compassioun."  
And with that word in swowne he fil adoun,  
And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.  
His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,  
Up caughte him and to bedde he hath him broght.  
Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght,  
Lete I this woful creature lye;  
Chese he, for me, whether he wol live or dye.

Arveragus, with hele and greet honour,  
As he that was of chivalrye the flour,  
Is comen hoom, and othere worthy men.  
O blisful artow now, thou Dorigen,  
That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes,  
The fresshe knight, the worthy man of armes,  
That loveth thee, as his owene hertes lyf.  
No-thing list him to been imaginatyf  
If any wight had spoke, whyl he was oute,  
To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute.  
He noght intendeth to no swich matere,  
But daunceth, justeth, maketh hir good chere;  
And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem dwelle.

And of the syke Aurelius wol I telle:  
In langour and in torment furious  
Two yeer and more lay wrecche Aurelius,  
Er any foot he mighte on erthe goon;  
Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,  
Save of his brother, which that was a clerk;  
He knew of al this wo and al this werk.  
For to non other creature certeyn  
Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.  
Under his brest he bar it more secree  
Than ever dide Pamphilus for Galathee.  
His brest was hool, with-oute for to sene;  
But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.

And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure  
In surgerye is perilous the cure,  
But men mighte touche the arwe, or come therby.  
His brother weep and wayled prively,  
Til atte laste him fil in remembraunce,  
That whyl he was at Orliens in Fraunce,  
As yonge clerkes, that been likerous  
To reden artes that been curious,  
And into every halke and every herne  
Particuler sciences for to lerne,  
He him remembred that, upon a day,  
At Orliens in studie a book he say  
Of magik naturel, which his felawe,  
That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe,  
Al were he ther to lerne another craft,  
Had prively upon his desk y-laft;  
Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns,  
Touchinge the eighte and twenty mansiouns  
That longen to the mone, and swich folye,  
As in our dayes is nat worth a flye;  
For holy chirches feith in our bileve  
Ne suffereth noon illusion us to greve.

And whan this book was in his remembraunce,  
Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,  
And to himself he seyde privily:  
"My brother shal be warisshed hastily;  
For I am siker that ther be sciences  
By which men make diverse apparences,  
Swiche as thise subtile tregetours pleye.  
For ofte at festes have I wel herd seye,  
That tregetours, withinne an halle large,  
Have maad come in a water and a barge,  
And in the halle rowen up and doun.  
Somtyme hath semed come a grim leoun;  
And somtyme floures springe as in a mede;  
Somtyme a vyne, and grapes whyte and rede;  
Somtyme a castel, al of lym and stoon;  
And whan hem lyked, voyded it anoon.  
Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.

Now than conclude I thus, that if I mighte  
At Orliens som old felawe y-finde,  
That hadde this mones mansions in minde,  
Or other magik naturel above,  
He sholde wel make my brother han his love.  
For with an apparence a clerk may make  
To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes blake  
Of Britaigne weren y-voyded everichon,  
And shippes by the brinke comen and gon,  
And in swich forme endure a day or two;  
Than were my brother warisshed of his wo;  
Than moste she nedes holden hir biheste,  
Or elles he shal shame hir atte leste."

What sholde I make a lenger tale of this?  
Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,  
And swich confort he yaf him for to gon  
To Orliens, that he up stirte anon,  
And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare,  
In hope for to ben lissed of his care.  
Whan they were come almost to that citee,  
But-if it were a two furlong or three,  
A young clerk roming by himself they mette,  
Which that in Latin thriftily hem grette,  
And after that he seyde a wonder thing:

"I knowe," quod he, "the cause of your coming";  
And er they ferther any fote wente,  
He tolde hem al that was in hir entente.  
This Briton clerk him asked of felawes  
The whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes;

And he answerde him that they dede were,  
For which he wept ful ofte many a tere.  
Doun of his hors Aurelius lighte anon,  
And forth with this magicien is he gon  
Hoom to his hous, and made hem wel at ese.  
Hem lakked no vitaille that mighte hem plese;  
So wel arrayed hous as ther was oon  
Aurelius in his lyf saugh never noon.  
He shewed him, er he wente to sopeer,  
Forestes, parkes ful of wilde deer;  
Ther saugh he hertes with hir homes hye,  
The gretteste that ever were seyn with ye.  
He saugh of hem an hondred slayn with houndes,  
And somme with arvves blede of bittre woundes.  
He saugh, whan voided were this wilde deer,  
Thise fauconers upon a fair river,  
That with hir haukes han the heron slayn.  
Tho saugh he knightes justing in a playn;  
And after this, he dide him swich plesaunce.

Ne make no contenance of hevinesse,  
That folk of yow may demon harm or gesso.”

And forth he cleped a squyer and a mayde:  
“Goth forth anon with Dorigen,” he sayde,  
“And bringeth hir to swich a place anon.”  
They take hir love, and on hir wey they gon;  
But they ne wiste why she thider wente.  
He nolde no wight tellen his entente.

Paraventure an heep of yow, y-wis, [11,802a]  
Wol holden him a lewed man in this, [6]  
That he wol putte his wyf in jeopardye; [c]  
Herkneth the tale, er ye up-on hir crye. [d]  
She may have better fortune than yow someth; [e]  
And whan that ye han herd the tale, demeth. [f]

This squyer, which that highte Aurelius  
On Dorigen that was so amorous,  
Of aventure happed hir to mete  
Amidde the toun, right in the quikkest strete.  
As she was boun to goon the wey forthright  
Toward the gardin ther-as she had hight.  
And he was to the gardinward also;  
For wel he spyed, whan she wolde go  
Out of hir hous to any maner place.  
But thus they mette, of aventure or grace;  
And he saleweth hir with glad entente,  
And asked of hir whiderward she wente?  
And she answerde, half as she were mad,  
“Un-to the gardin, as myn housbond bad.  
My trouthe for to holde, alias! alias!”  
Aurelius gan wondren on this cas.

And in his herte had greet compassioun  
Of hir and of hir lamentacioun,  
And of Arveragus, the worthy knight,  
That bad hir holden al that she had hight.  
So looth him was his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe;  
And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe,  
Consideringe the beste on every syde,  
That fro his lust yet were him lever abyde  
Than doon so heigh a cherlish wrecchednesse  
Agayns franchyse and alle gentillesse;

For which in fewe wordes seyde he thus:

“Madame, seyth to your lord Arveragus,  
That sith I see his grete gentillesse  
To yow, and eek I see wel your distresse,  
That him were lever han shame (and that were routhe)  
Than ye to me sholde breke thus your trouthe,  
I have wel lever ever to sulfre wo  
Than I departe the love bitwix yow two.  
I yow relesse, madame, in-to your hond  
Quit every surement and every bond,  
That ye han maad to me as heer-biforn,  
Sith thilke tyme which that ye were born.  
My trouthe I plighte, I shal yow never repreve  
Of no biheste, and here I take my love,  
As of the treweste and the beste wyf  
That ever yet I knew in al my lyf.  
But every wyf be-war of hir biheste,  
On Dorigen remembreth atte leste.  
Thus can a squyer doon a gentil dede,  
As well as can a knight, withouten drede.”

[11,849–11,910]

She thonketh him upon hir knees al bare,  
And home unto hir housbond is she fare,  
And tolde him al as ye han herd me sayd;  
And be ye siker, he was so weel apayd,  
That it were inpossible me to write;  
What sholde I lenger of this cas endyte?  
Arveragus and Dorigen his wif  
In sovreyn blisse leden forth hir lyf.  
Never eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene;  
He cherisseth hir as though she were a quene;  
And she was to him trewe for evermore.  
Of thise two folk ye gete of me na-more.

Aurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn,  
Curseth the tyme that ever he was born:  
“Allas,” quod he, “alias! that I bihighte  
Of pure gold a thousand pound of wighte  
Un-to this philosophre! how shal I do?  
I see na-more but that I am fordo.  
Myn heritage moot I nedes selle,  
And been a begger; heer may I nat dwelle,  
And shamen al my kinrede in this place,  
But I of him may gete bettre grace.  
But nathelees, I wol of him assaye,  
At certeyn dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye,  
And thanke him of his grete curteisye;  
My trouthe wol I kepe, I wol nat lye.”

With herte soor he gooth un-to his cofre,  
And broghte gold un-to this philosophre,  
The value of fyve hundred pound, I gesse,  
And him bisecheth, of his gentillesse,  
To graunte him dayes of the remenaunt.  
And seyde, “maister, I dar wel make avaunt,  
I failled never of my trouthe as yit;  
For sikerly my dette shal be quit  
Towardes yow, how-ever that I fare  
To goon a-begged in my kirtle bare.  
But wolde ye vouche-sauf, upon suretee,  
Two yeer or three for to respyten me.  
Than were I wel; for elles moot I selle  
Myn heritage; ther is na-more to telle.”

This philosophre sobrely answerde,  
And seyde thus, whan he thise wordes herde:  
“Have I nat holden covenant unto thee?”  
“Yes, certes, wel and trewely,” quod he.  
“Hastow nat had thy lady as thee lyketh?”  
“No, no,” quod he, and sorwefully he syketh.  
“What was the cause? tel me if thou can.”  
Aurelius his tale anon bigan,  
And tolde him al, as ye han herd bifore;  
It nedeth nat to yow reherce it more.  
He seide, “Arveragus, of gentillesse,  
Had lever dye in sorwe and in distresse  
Than that his wyf were of hir trouthe fals.”  
The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde him als,  
How looth hir was to been a wikked wyf,  
And that she lever had lost that day hir lyf,  
And that hir trouthe she swoor, through innocence:  
“She never erst herde speke of apparence;  
That made me han of hir so greet pitee.  
And right as frely as he sente hir me,  
As frely sente I hir to him ageyn.  
This al and som, ther is na-more to seyn.”

---

Upon her bare knees did she thank him there,  
And home unto her husband did she fare,  
And told him all, as you have heard it said;  
And be assured, he was so pleased and glad  
That ’twere impossible of it to write.  
What should I further of this case indite?  
Arveragus and Dorigen his wife  
In sovereign happiness led forth their life.  
Never did any anger come between;  
He cherished her as though she were a queen;  
And she to him was true for evermore.  
Of these two folk you get from me no more.

Aurelius, whose wealth was now forlorn,  
Curseth the time that ever he was born:  
“Alas!” cried he, “Alas! that I did bighte  
I’d pay fine gold a thousand pounds by wight  
To this philosopher! What shall I do?  
I see no more but that I am fordo.  
My heritage must I needs then sell,  
And be a beggar; here may I not dwell,  
And shame all my kinred in this place,  
Unless I get of him some better grace.  
And so I’ll go to him and try, today,  
On certain dates, year by year, to pay,  
And thank him for his princely courtesy;  
For I will keep my troth, and I’ll not lie.”

With sore heart he went unto his coffer,  
And brought gold unto this philosopher,  
The value of five hundred pounds, I guess,  
And him besought, of his nobleness,  
To grant him dates for payment of the rest,  
And said: “Dear master, I may well protest  
I’ve never failed to keep my word as yet;  
For certainly my debt shall be quit  
Toward you, however after I may fare,  
Even to begging, save for kirtle bare.  
But if you’d grant, upon good surety,  
Two years or three of respite unto me,  
Then were all well; otherwise must I sell  
My heritage; there is no more to tell.”

Then this philosopher soberly answered,  
And spoke in this wise, when these words he heard:  
“Have I not fairly earned my promised fee?”  
“Yes, truly, you have done so, sir,” said he.  
“Have you not had the lady at your will?”  
“No, no,” said he, and sighed, and then was still.  
“What was the reason? Tell me if you can.”  
Aurelius his tale anon began,  
And told him all, as you have heard before;  
It needs not I repeat it to you more.  
He said: “Arveragus, of nobleness,  
Had rather die in sorrow and distress  
Than that his wife were to her promise false.”  
He told of Dorigen’s grief, too, and how else  
She had been loath to live a wicked wife,  
And rather would that day have lost her life,  
And that her troth she swore through ignorance:  
“She’d ne’er before heard of such appearance;  
Which made me have for her such great pity.  
And just as freely as he sent her me,  
As freely sent I her to him again.  
This is the sum, there’s no more to explain.”

## THE FRANKLIN’S TALE (concluding lines)

Then answered this philosopher: “Dear brother,  
Each one of you has nobly dealt with other.  
You are a squire, true, and he is a knight,  
But God forbid, for His blessed might,  
A clerk should never do a gentle deed  
As well as any of you. Of this take heed!

“Sir, I release to you your thousand pound,  
As if, right now, you’d crept out of the ground  
And never, before now, had known of me.  
For, sir, I’ll take of you not one penny  
For all my art and all my long travail.  
You have paid well for all my meat and ale;  
It is enough, so farewell, have good day!”  

And took his horse and went forth on his way.

Lordinges, this question would I ask you now:  
Which was most generous, do you think, and how?  
Pray tell me this before you farther wend.  
I can no more, my tale is at an end.

[11,911–11,970]

This philosophre answerde, “leve brother,  
Everich of yow dide gentilly til other.  
Thou art a squyer, and he is a knight;  
But god forbede, for his blisful might,  
But-if a clerk coude doon a gentil dede

Sire, I relesse thee thy thousand pound,  
As thou right now were cropen out of the ground,  
Ne never er now ne haddest knowen me.

Thou hast y-payed wel for my vitaille;  
It is y-nogh, and farewel, have good day.”  

And took his hors, and forth he gooth his way.

Lordinges, this question wolde I aske now.  
Which was the moste free, as thinketh yow?  
Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende.  
I can na-more, my tale is at an ende.

## THE PHYSICIAN’S TALE

HERE FOLLOWETH THE PHYSICIAN’S TALE

There was, as tells us Titus Livius,  
A knight whose name was called Virginius,  
Fulfilled of honour and of worthiness,  
Who many friends and much wealth did possess.  
This knight had had a daughter by his wife,  
Nor children more had he in all his life.  
Fair was this maid, in excellent beauty  
Above all others that a man may see;  
For Nature had, with sovereign diligence,  
Moulded her to so great an excellence  
She seemed to say: “Behold now, I, Nature,  
Thus can I form and paint a creature pure  
When I desire. Who can it counterfeit?  
Pygmalion? Nay, not though he forge and beat,  
Or carve, or paint; and I dare say again,  
Apelles, Zeuxis too, should work in vain,  
Either to carve or paint, or forge or beat,  
If they presumed my work to counterfeit.  
For He Who is Creator Principal  
Has made of me His Vicar General  
To form and colour earthly creatures all,  
Just as I like, for they’re mine, great and small  
Under the moon, the which may wax and wane;  
And for my work I ask no payment vain;  
My Lord and I are of one sole accord;  
I made her in the worship of my Lord.  
So do I other fair or foul creatures,  
What colours though they have, or what figures.”  
It seems to me that Nature thus would say.

This maid was fourteen years of age, this may  
In whom Dame Nature had so great delight.  
For just as she can paint a lily white  
Or redden rose, even with such a stroke  
She did this creature by her art evoke  
Ere she was born, painting her sweet limbs free  
In such true colours as they’d come to be;

lThe Prologue [11,929–34]

Ther was, as telleth Titus Livius,  
A knight that called was Virginius,  
Fulfild of honour and of worthinesse,  
And strong of freendes and of greet richesse.  
This knight a doghter hadde by his wyf.  
No children hadde he mo in al his lyf.  
Fair was this mayde in excellent beautee  
Aboven every wight that man may see;  
For Nature hath with sovereyn diligence  
Y-formed hir in so greet excellence.  
As though she wolde seyn, “lo! I, Nature,  
Thus can I forme and peynte a creature,  
Whan that me list; who can me countrefete?  
Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge and bete,  
Or grave, or peynte; for I dar wel seyn,  
Apelles, Zeuxis, sholde werche in veyn,  
Outher to grave or peynte or forge or bete,  
If they presumed me to countrefete.  
For he that is the former principal  
Hath maked me his vicaire general,  
To forme and peynten erthely creaturis  
Right as me list, and ech thing in my cure is  
Under the mone, that may wane and waxe.  
And for my werk right no-thing wol I axe;  
My lord and I ben ful of oon accord;  
I made hir to the worship of my lord.  
So do I alle myne othere creatures,  
What colour that they han, or what figures.” —  
Thus semeth me that Nature wolde seye.

This mayde of age twelf yeer was and tweye,  
In which that Nature hadde swich delyt.  
For right as she can peynte a lilie whyt  
And reed a rose, right with swich peynture  
She peynted hath this noble creature  
Er she were born, up-on hir limes free,  
Wher-as by right swiche colours sholde be;

[spurious by Skcat, is omiued.]

And Phoebus dide her tresses grete  
Lyk to the stremes of his burned hete.  
And if that right excellent was hir beautee,  
A thousand-fold more virtuous was she.  
In hir ne lacked no condicion  
That is to preisen, as by discrecioun.  
As wel in goost as body chast was she;  
For which she floured in virginitee  
With alle humilitee and abstinence,  
With alle attemperaunce and pacience,  
With mesure eek of bering and array.  
Discreet she was in answering alway;  
Though she were wys as Pallas, dar I seyn,  
Hir facound eek ful wommanly and pleyn.  
No countrefeted termes hadde she  
To seme wys; but after hir degree  
She spak, and alle hir wordes more and lesse  
Souninge in vertu and in gentillesse.  
Shamfast she was in maydens shamfastnesse,  
Constant in herte, and ever in bisinesse  
To dryve hir out of ydel slogardye.

Bacchus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrye;  
For wyn and youthe doon Venus encrece,  
As men in fyr wol casten oile or grece.  
And of hir owene vertu, unconstreyned,  
She hath ful ofte tyme syk hir feyned,  
For that she wolde fleen the companye  
Wher lykly was to treten of folye,  
As is at festes, revels, and at daunces.  
That been occasions of daliaunces;  
Swich thinges maken children for to be  
To sone rype and bold, as men may see,  
Which is ful perilous, and hath ben yore.  
For al to sone may she leme lore  
Of boldnesse, whan she woxen is a wyf.

And ye maistresses in your olde lyf,  
That lordes doghtres han in governaunce,  
Ne taketh of my wordes no displesaunce;  
Thenketh that ye ben set in governinges  
Of lordes doghtres, only for two thinges:  
Outher for ye han kept your honestee,  
Or elles ye han falle in freletee,  
And knowen wel y-nough the olde daunce,  
And han forsaken fully swich meschaunce  
For evermo; therfore, for Cristes sake,  
To teche hem vertu loke that ye ne slake.

A theef of venisoun, that hath forlaft  
His likerousnesse, and al his olde craft,  
Can kepe a forest best of any man.  
Now kepeth hem wel, for if ye wol, ye can;  
Loke wel that ye un-to no vice assente,  
Lest ye be dampned for your wikke entente;  
For who-so doth, a traitour is certeyn.  
And taketh kepe of that that I shal seyn;  
Of alle tresons sovereyn pestilence  
Is whan a wight bitrayseth innocence.

Ye fadres and ye modres eek also,  
Though ye han children, be it oon or two,  
Yours is the charge of al hir surveyaunce,  
Whyl that they been under your governaunce.  
Beth war that by ensample of your livinge,  
Or by your necligence in chastisinge,  
They fall and perish; for I dare wel seye,  
If that they doon, ye shul it dere abeye.  
Under a shepherde soft and negligent  
Full many a sheep and lamb by wolf is rent.  
Suffice one ensample, as I give it here,  
For I must in my story persevere.

This mayde, of which I do this praise express,  
Guarded herself, nor needed governess;  
For in her daily life all maids might read,  
As in a book, every good word or deed  
That might become a maiden virtuous;  
She was so prudent and so bounteous.  
From all this grew the fame on every side  
Of both her beauty and her goodness wide;  
Throughout that land they praised her, every one  
That virtue loved; and Envy stood alone,  
That sorry is when others live in weal  
And for their woe will ever gladness feel.

(Doctor Augustine’s are these words, I own).

This maid, upon a day, went into town  
Unto a temple, with her mother dear,  
As the wont is of young maids everywhere.  
Now there was then a justice in that town  
Was governor of all the region known.  
And so befell, this judge his two eyes cast  
Upon this maid, noting her beauty fast,  
As she went by the place wherein he stood.  
Swiftly his heart was altered, and his mood,  
He was so caught by beauty of the maid,  
And to his own dark secret heart he said:  
“She shall be mine in spite of any man!”

Anon the Fiend into his bosom ran  
And taught him swiftly how, by treachery,  
The maiden to his purpose might win he.  
For truly not to bribery or force  
Would it avail, he thought, to have recourse,  
Since she had many friends, and was so good,  
So strong in virtue, that he never could  
By any subtle means her favour win  
And make her give her body unto sin.

Therefore, and with great scheming up and down,  
He sent to find a fellow of the town,  
Which man, he knew, was cunning and was bold.  
And unto this man, when the judge had told  
His secret, then he made himself right sure  
That it should come to ears of no creature,  
For if it did the fellow’d lose his head.  
And when assent to this crime had been said,  
Glad was the judge, and then he made great cheer  
And gave the fellow precious gifts and dear.  
When plotted out was their conspiracy,  
From point to point, how all his lechery  
Should have its will, performing craftily,  
As you shall hear it now told openly,  
Home went the churl, whose name was Claudius.  
This false judge, who was known as Appius  
(Such was his name, for this is no fable,  
But an historical event I tell,  
At least the gist is true, beyond a doubt)—  
This false judge goes now busily about  
To hasten his delight in all he may.  
And so befell soon after, on a day,

[12,033–12,094]

That they ne perisse; for I dar wel seye,  
If that they doon, ye shul it dere abeye.  
Under a shepherd soft and negligent  
The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb to-rent.  
Sufficeth one ensample now as here,  
For I mot turne agayn to my matere.

This maid, of which I wol this tale expresse,  
So kepte hir-self, hir neded no maistresse;  
For in hir living maydens mighten rede,  
As in a book, every good word or dede,  
That longeth to a mayden vertuous;  
She was so prudent and so bounteous.  
For which the fame out-sprong on every syde  
Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde;  
That thurgh that land they preysed hir echone,  
That loved vertu, save envious allone,  
That sory is of other mennes wele,  
And glad is of his sorwe and his unhele.

(The doctour maketh this descripcioun).

This mayde upon a day wente in the toun  
Toward a temple, with hir moder dere,  
As is of yonge maydens the manere.  
Now was ther thanne a justice in that toun,  
That governour was of that regioun.  
And so bifel, this juge his eyen caste  
Upon this mayde, avysinge him ful faste,  
As she cam forby ther this juge stood.  
Anon his herte chaunged and his mood,  
So was he caught with beautee of this mayde;  
And to him-self ful prively he sayde,  
“This mayde shal be myn, for any man.”  
Anon the feend in-to his herte ran,  
And taughte him sodeynly, that he by slighte  
The mayden to his purpos winne mighte.  
For certes, by no force, ne by no mede,  
Him thoughte, he was nat able for to spede;  
For she was strong of freendes, and eek she  
Confermed was in swich soverayn bountee,  
That wel he wiste he mighte hir never winne  
As for to make hir with hir body sinne.

For which, by greet deliberacioun,  
He sente after a churl, was in the toun,  
Which that he knew for subtil and for bold.  
This juge unto this churl his tale hath told  
In secrete wise, and made him to ensure,  
He sholde telle it to no creature,  
And if he dide, he sholde lese his heed.  
Whan that assented was this cursed reed,  
Glad was this juge and maked him greet chere,  
And yaf him yiftes preciouse and dere.  
Whan shapen was al hir conspiracye  
Fro point to point, how that his lecherye  
Perfourmed sholde been ful subtilly,  
As ye shul here it after openly,  
Hoom gooth the churl, that hight Claudius.  
This false juge that hight Apius,  
So was his name (for this is no fable,  
But knowen for historial thing notable,  
The sentence of it sooth is, out of doute),  
This false juge gooth now faste aboute  
To hasten his delyt al that he may.  
And so bifel sone after, on a day,

[12,095–12,156]

This false juge, as telleth us the storie,  
As he was wont, sat in his consistorie,  
And yaf his domes upon sondry cas.  
This false churl cam forth a ful greet pas,  
And seyde, “lord, if that it be your wille,  
As dooth me right upon this pitous bille,  
In which I pleyne upon Virginius.  
And if that he wol seyn it is nat thus,  
I wol it preve, and finde good witnesse,  
That sooth is that my bille wol expresse.”

The juge answerde, “of this, in his absence,  
I may nat yeve diffinitif sentence.  
Lat do him calle, and I wol gladly here;  
Thou shalt have al right, and no wrong here.”

Virginius cam, to wite the juges wille,  
And right anon was rad this cursed bille;  
The sentence of it was as ye shul here.

“To yow, my lord, sire Apius so dere,  
Sheweth your povre servant Claudius,  
How that a knight, called Virginius,  
Agayns the lawe, agayn al equitee,  
Holdeth, expres agayn the wil of me,  
Aly servant, which that is my thral by right,  
Which fro myn hous was stole upon a night,  
Whyl that she was ful yong; this wol I preve  
By witnesse, lord, so that it nat yow greve.  
She nis his doghter nat, what so he seye;  
Wherfore to yow, my lord the juge, I preye,  
Yeld me my thral, if that it be your wille.”

Lo! this was al the sentence of his bille.

Virginius gan upon the churl biholde,  
But hastily, er he his tale tolde,  
And wolde have preved it, as sholde a knight,  
And eke by witnessing of many a wight,  
That it was fals that seyde his adversarie.  
This cursed juge wolde no-thing tarie,  
Ne here a word more of Virginius,  
But yaf his jugement, and seyde thus:—

“I deme anon this churl his servant have;  
Thou shalt no longer in thyn hous hir save.  
Go bring hir forth, and put hir in our warde.  
The churl shal have his thral, this I awarde.”

And whan this worthy knight Virginius,  
Through sentence of this justice Apius,  
Aloste by force his dere doghter yiven  
Unto the juge, in lecherye to liven,  
He gooth him hoom, and sette him in his halle.  
And leet anon his dere doghter calle,  
And, with a face deed as asshen colde,  
Upon hir humble face he gan biholde.

With fadres pitee stiking through his herte,  
Al wolde he from his purpos nat converte.

“Doghter,” quod he, “Virginia, by thy name,  
There been two weyes, outher deeth or shame,  
That thou most suffre; alias! that I was bore!  
For never thou deservedest wherefore  
To dyen with a swerd or with a knyf.  
O dere doghter, ender of my lyf,  
Which I have fostred up with swich plesaunce,  
That thou were never out of my remembraunce!  
O doghter, which that art my laste wo,  
And in my lyf my laste joye also.

O gemme of chastite, in pacience  
Take thou thy deeth, for this is my sentence.  
For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed;  
My pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed.  
Allas! that ever Apius thee say!  
Thus hath he falsly juged thee to-day” —  
And tolde hir al the cas, as ye biforc  
Han herd; nat nedeth for to telle it more.  

“O mercy, dere fader,” quod this mayde.  
And with that word she both hir armes layde  
About his nekke, as she was wont to do:  
The teres broste out of hir eyen two.  
And seyde, “gode fader, shal I dye?  
Is ther no grace? Is ther no remedye?”  

“No, certes, dere doghter myn,” quod he.  
“Thanne yif me leyser, fader myn,” quod she,  
“My deeth for to compleyne a litel space;  
For pardee, Jeptha yaf his doghter grace  
For to compleyne, er he hir slow, alas!

But for she ran hir fader first to see,  
To welcome him with greet solempnitee.”  

And with that word she fil aswowne anon,  
And after, whan hir swowning is agon,  
She ryseth up, and to hir fader sayde,  
“Blessed be god, that I shal dye a mayde.  
Yif me my deeth, er that I have a shame;  
Doth with your child your wil, a goddes name!”  

And with that word she preyed him ful ofte  
That with his swerd he wolde smyte softe,  
And with that word aswowne down she fil.  
Hir fader, with ful sorweful herte and wil,  
Hir heed of smoot, and by the top it hente,  
And to the juge he gan it to presente,  
As he sat yet in doom in consistorie.  
And whan the juge it saugh, as seith the storie,  
He bad to take him and anhange him faste.  
But right anon a thousand peple in thraste  
To save the knight, for routhe and for pitee;  
For knowen was the false iniquitee.  
The peple anon hath suspect of this thing,  
By manere of the cherles chalanging,  
That it was by th’assent of Apius;  
They wisten wel that he was lecherous.  
For which un-to this Apius they goon,  
And caste him in a prison right anon,  
Wher-as he slow hym-self; and Claudius,  
That servant was un-to this Apius,  
Was demed for to hange upon a tree;  
But that Virginius, of his pitee,  
So preyde for him that he was exiled;  
And elles, certes, he hadde been begyled.  
The remenant were anhanged, more and lesse,  
That were consentant of this cursednesse. —  

Heer men may seen how sinne hath his merite!  
Beth war, for no man woot whom God wol smyte  
In no degree, ne in which maner wyse  
The worm of conscience may agryse  
Of wikked lyf, though it so privee be,  
That no man woot ther-of but God and he.

# THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PARDONER

Our host began to swear as a madman would:
“Halloo!” he cried, “now by the Nails and Blood!
This was a false churl and a false justice!

As shameful death as thinking may devise
Come to such judge who such a helper has!
And so this luckless maid is slain, alas!

Alas, too dearly paid she for beauty!

Wherefore I always say, as men may see,
That Fortune’s gifts, or those of Dame Nature,
Are cause of death to many a good creature.

Her beauty was her death, I say again;
Alas, so pitiably she there was slain!

From both the kinds of gift I speak of now
Men often take more harm than help, I vow.

But truly, my own master lief and dear,
This is a very pitiful tale to hear,
Yet let us pass it by as of no force.

I pray to God to save your gentle corse,
Your urinals and all your chamber-pots,
Your hippocras and medicines and lots
And every boxful of electuary;
God bless them, and Our Lady, holy Mary!
So may I prosper, you’re a proper man,
And like a prelate too, by Saint Ronan!

Said I not well? I can’t speak in set terms;
But well I know my heart with grief so warms
That almost I have caught a cardiac pain.
Body and bones! Save I some remedy gain,
Or else a draught of fresh-drawn, malty ale,
Or save I hear, anon, a merry tale,
My heart is lost for pity of this maid.

You, bon ami, you pardoner,” he said,
“Tell us some pleasant tale or jest, anon.”

“It shall be done,” said he, “by Saint Ronan!
But first,” he said, “just here, at this ale-stake,
I will both drink and eat a bite of cake.”

But then these gentle folk began to cry:
“Nay, let him tell us naught of ribaldry;
Tell us some moral thing, that we may hear
Wisdom, and then we gladly will give ear.”

“I grant it, aye,” said he, “but I must think
Upon some seemly tale the while I drink.”

## THE PROLOGUE OF THE PARDONER’S TALE

Radix malorum est Cupiditas: Ad Timotheum, sexto

> “Masters,” quoth he, “in churches, when I preach,  
> I am at pains that all shall hear my speech,  
> And ring it out as roundly as a bell,  
> For I know all by heart the thing I tell.  
>  
> My theme is always one, and ever was:  
> ‘Radix malorum est cupiditas.’  
>  
> “First I announce the place whence I have come,  
> And then I show my pardons, all and some.  
>  
> Our liege-lord’s seal on my patent perfect,  
> I show that first, my safety to protect.  
>  
> And then no man’s so bold, no priest nor clerk,  
> As to disturb me in Christ’s holy work;  
>  
> And after that my tales I marshal all.  
> Indulgences of pope and cardinal,  
> Of patriarch and bishop, these I do show,  
> And in Latin speak some words, a few,  
> To spice therewith a bit my sermoning  
> And stir men to devotion, marvelling.  
>  
> Then show I forth my hollow crystal-stones,  
> Which are crammed full of rags, aye, and of bones;  
> Relics are these, as they think, every one.  
>  
> Then I’ve in latten box a shoulder-bone  
> Which came out of a holy Hebrew’s sheep.  
>  
> ‘Good men,’ say I, ‘my words in memory keep;  
> If this bone shall be washed in any well,  
> Then if a cow, calf, sheep, or ox should swell  
> That’s eaten snake, or been by serpent stung,  
> Take water of that well and wash its tongue,  
> And ’twill be well anon; and furthermore,  
> Of pox and scab and every other sore  
> Shall every sheep be healed that of this well  
> Drinks but one draught; take heed of what I tell.  
> And if the man that owns the beasts, I trow,  
> Shall every week, and that before cock-crow,  
> And before breakfast, drink thereof a draught,  
> As that Jew taught of yore in his priestcraft,  
> His beasts and all his store shall multiply.  
>  
> And, good sirs, it’s a cure for jealousy;  
> For though a man be fallen in jealous rage,  
> Let one make of this water his pottage  
> And nevermore shall he his wife mistrust,  
> Though he may know the truth of all her lust,  
> Even though she’d taken two priests, aye, or three.  
>  
> “‘Here is a mitten, too, that you may see.  
> Who puts his hand therein, I say again,  
> He shall have increased harvest of his grain,  
> After he’s sown, be it of wheat or oats,  
> Just so he offers pence or offers groats.  
>  
> “‘Good men and women, one thing I warn you,  
> If any man be here in church right now  
> That’s done a sin so horrible that he  
> Dare not, for shame, of that sin shriven be,  
> Or any woman, be she young or old,  
> That’s made her husband cuckold,  
> Such folk shall have no power and no grace  
> To offer to my relics in this place.  
>  
> And who-so finds himself without such blame,  
> He will come up and offer, in God’s name,  
> And I’ll absolve him by authority  
> That has, by bull, been granted unto me.’”

> By this fraud have I won me, year by year,  
> A hundred marks, since I’ve been pardoner.  
> I stand up like a scholar in pulpit,  
> And when the ignorant people all do sit,  
> I preach, as you have heard me say before,  
> And tell a hundred false japes, less or more.  
>  
> I am at pains, then, to stretch forth my neck,  
> And east and west upon the folk I beck,  
> As does a dove that’s sitting on a barn.  
> With hands and swift tongue, then, do I so yarn  
> That it’s a joy to see my busyness.  
>  
> Of avarice and of all such wickedness  
> Is all my preaching, thus to make them free  
> With offered pence, the which pence come to me.  
> For my intent is only pence to win,  
> And not at all for punishment of sin.  
>  
> When they are dead, for all I think thereon  
> Their souls may well black-berrying have gone!  
> For, certainly, there’s many a sermon grows  
> Ofttimes from evil purpose, as one knows;  
>  
> Some for folks’ pleasure and for flattery,  
> To be advanced by all hypocrisy,  
> And some for vainglory, and some for hate.  
>  
> For, when I dare not otherwise debate,  
> Then do I sharpen well my tongue and sting  
> The man in sermons, and upon him fling  
> My lying defamations, if but he  
> Has wronged my brethren or wronged me.  
>  
> For though I mention not his proper name,  
> Men know whom I refer to, all the same,  
> By signs I make and other circumstances.  
>  
> Thus I pay those who do us displeasances.  
> Thus spit I out my venom under hue  
> Of holiness, to seem both good and true.  
>  
> “But briefly my intention I’ll express;  
> I preach no sermon, save for covetousness.  
> For that my theme is yet, and ever was,  
> ‘Radix malorum est cupiditas.’  
>  
> Thus can I preach against that self-same vice  
> Which I indulge, and that is avarice.  
>  
> But though myself be guilty of that sin,  
> Yet can I cause these other folk to win  
> From avarice and really to repent.  
> But that is not my principal intent.  
>  
> I preach no sermon, save for covetousness;  
> This should suffice of that, though, as I guess.  
>  
> “Then do I cite examples, many a one,  
> Out of old stories and of time long gone,  
> For vulgar people all love stories old;  
> Such things they can re-tell well and can hold.  
>  
> What? Think you that because I’m good at preaching  
> I’ll live of my free will in poverty?  
> No, no, that’s never been my policy!  
>  
> For I will preach and beg in sundry lands;  
> I will not work and labour with my hands,  
> Nor baskets weave and live thereby,  
> Because I will not beg in vain, say I.  
>  
> I will none of the apostles counterfeit;  
> I will have money, wool, and cheese, and wheat,  
> Though it be given by the poorest page,  
> Or by the poorest widow in the village,  
> And though her children perish of famine.  
>  
> Nay! I will drink good liquor of the vine  
> And have a pretty wench in every town.  
>  
> But hearken, masters, to conclusion shown:  
> Your wish is that I tell you all a tale.  
>  
> Now that I’ve drunk a draught of musty ale,  
> By God, I hope that I can tell something  
> That shall, in reason, be to your liking.  
>  
> For though I am myself a vicious man,  
> Yet I would tell a moral tale, and can,  
> The which I’m wont to preach more gold to win.  
> Now hold your peace! my tale I will begin.”

Here followeth the same in the older tongue:

Lordings, quod he, in chirches whan I preche,  
I peyne me to han an hauteyn speche,  
And ringe it out as round as gooth a belle.  
For I can al by rote that I telle.  
My theme is alwey oon, and ever was —  
“Radix malorum est cupiditas.”  

First I pronounce whennes that I come,  
And than my bulles shewe I, alle and somme.  
Our lige lordes seel on my patente,  
That shewe I first, my body to warente,  
That no man be so bold, ne preest ne clerk,  
Me to destourbe of Cristes holy werk;  
And after that than telle I forth my tales,  
Bulles of popes and of cardinales,  
Of patriarkes, and bishoppes I shewe;  
And in Latyn I speke a wordes fewe,  
To saffron with my predicacioun,  
And for to stire men to devocioun.  

Than shewe I forth my long cristal stones,  
Y-crammed ful of cloutes and of bones;  
Reliks been they, as wenen they eche-on.  
Than have I in Iatoun a sholder-boon  
Which that was of an holy Jewes shepe.  

“Good men,” seye I, “tak of my wordes kepe;  
If that this boon be wasshe in any welle,  
If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swelle  
That any worm hath ete, or worm y-stonge,  
Tak water of that welle, and wash his tonge,  
And it is hool anon; and forthermore,  
Of pokkes and of scabbe, and every sore  
Shal every sheep be hool, that of this welle  
Drinketh a draughte; tak kepe eek what I telle.  

If that the good-man, that the bestes oweth,  
Wol every wike, er that the cok him croweth,  
Fastinge, drinken of this welle a draughte,  
As thilke holy Jewe our eldres taughte,  
His bestes and his stoor shal multiplye.  

And, sirs, also it heleth jalousye;  
For, though a man be falle in jalous rage,  
Let maken with this water his potage,  
And never shal he more his wif mistriste,  
Though he the sooth of hir defaute wiste;  
Al hadde she taken preestes two or three.  

Heer is a miteyn eek, that ye may see.  
He that his hond wol putte in this miteyn,  
He shal have multiplying of his greyn,  
Whan he hath sowen, be it whete or otes,  
So that he offre pens, or elles grotes.  

Good men and wommen, o thing wame I yow.  
If any wight be in this chirche now,  
That hath doon sinne horrible, that he  
Dar nat, for shame, of it y-shriven be,  
Or any wommen, be she yong or old,  
That hath y-maad hir housbond cokewold,  
Swich folk shul have no power ne no grace  
To offren to my reliks in this place.  

And who-so findeth hym out of swich blame,  
He wol com up and offre in goddes name,  
And I assoille hym by the auctoritee  
Which that by bulle y-graunted was to me.”

By this gaude have I wonne, yeer by yeer,  
An hundred mark sith I was Pardoner.  
I stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet,  
And whan the lewed peple is doun y-set,  
I preche, so as ye han herd bifore,  
And telle an hundred false japes more.  

Than peyne I me to strecche forth the nekke,  
And est and west upon the peple I bekke,  
As doth a dowve sitting on a berne.  
Myn hondes and my tonge goon so yerne,  
That it is joye to see my bisinesse.  

Of avaryce and of swich cursednesse  
Is al my preching, for to make hem fre  
To yeve her pens, and namely unto me.  
For my entente is nat but for to winne,  
And no-thing for correccioun of sinne.  
I rekke never, whan that they ben beried,  
Though that her soules goon a-blakeberied!  

For certes, many a predicacioun  
Comth ofte tyme of yvel entencioun;  
Som for plesaunce of folk and flaterye,  
To been avaunced by hypocrisye,  
And som for veyne glorie, and som for hate.  

For, whan I dar nat other weyes debate,  
Than wol I stinge hym with my tonge smerte  
In preching, so that he shal nat asterte  
To been defamed falsly, if that he  
Hath trespased to my bretheren or to me.  

For, though I telle noght his propre name,  
Men shal wel knowe that it is the same  
By signes and by othere circumstances.  
Thus quyte I folk that doon us displesances;  
Thus spitte I out my venim under hewe  
Of holynesse, to seme holy and trewe.  

But shortly myn entente I wol devyse;  
I preche of no-thing but for coveityse.  
Therfor my theme is yet, and ever was —  
“Radix malorum est cupiditas.”  

Thus can I preche agayn that same vice  
Which that I use, and that is avaryce.  
But, though myself be gilty in that sinne,  
Yet can I maken other folk to twinne  
From avaryce, and sore to repente.  
But that is nat my principal entente.  
I preche no-thing but for coveityse;  
Of this matere it oghte y-nogh suffyse.  

Than telle I hem ensamples many oon  
Of olde stories, longe tyme agoon:  
For lewed peple loven tales olde;  
Swich thinges can they wel reporte and holde.  
What? trowe ye, the whyles I may preche,  
And winne gold and silver for I teche?

In Flaundres whylom was a companye  
Of yonge folk, that haunteden folye.  
As ryot, hasard, stewes, and tavernes,  
Wher-as, with harpes, lutes, and giternes,  
They daunce and pleye at dees bothe day and night,  
And ete also and drinken over hir might,  
Through which they doon the devel sacrifyse  
Within that develes temple, in cursed wyse.  
By superfluitee abhominable;  
Hir othes been so grete and so dampnable,  
That it is grisly for to here hem swere;  
Our blissed lordes body they to-tere;  
Hem thought the Jewes rente hym noght y-nough;  
And ech of hem at otheres sinne lough.  

And right anon than comen tombesteres  
Fetys and smale, and yonge fruytesteres.  
Singers with harpes, baudes, wafereres,  
Whiche been the verray develes officeres  
To kindle and blowe the fyr of lecherye,  
That is annexed un-to glotonye;  
The holy writ take I to my witnesse,  
That luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse.  

Lo, how that dronken Loth, unkindely,  
Lay by his doghtres two, unwittingly;  
So dronke he was, he niste what he wroghte.  
Herodes, who-so wel the stories soghte,  
Whan he of wyn was replet at his feste,  
Right at his owene table he yaf his heste  
To sleen the Baptist John ful giltelees.  

Senek seith eek a good word doutelees;  
He seith he can no difference finde  
Bitwix a man that is out of his minde  
And a man which that is dronken-que.  
But that woodnesse, y-fallen in a shrewe,  
Persevereth longer than doth dronkenesse.  

O glotonye, ful of cursednesse,  
O cause first of our confusioun,  
O original of our dampnacioun,  
Til Crist had boght us with his blood agayn!  
Lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn,  
Aboght was thilke cursed vilainye;  
Corrupt was al this world for glotonye!  
Adam our fader, and his wyf also,  
Fro Paradys to labour and to wo  
Were driven for that vice, it is no drede;  
For whyl that Adam fasted, as I rede,  
He was in Paradys; and whan that he  
Eet of the fruyt defended on the tree,  
Anon he was out-cast to wo and peyne.  
O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!  
O, wiste a man how many maladyes  
Folwen of excesse and of glotonyes.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE PARDONER'S TALE

### Middle English (cleaned)

He wolde been the more mesurable  
Of his diete, sittinge at his table.

Allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,  
Maketh that Est and West, and North and South,  
In erthe, in eir, in water men to-swinke  
To gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drinke!

Of this matere, O Paul, wel canstow trete,

“Mete unto wombe, and wombe eke unto mete,  
Shal God destroyen bothe,” as Paulus seith.

Allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith,  
To seye this word, and fouler is the dede.

Whan man so drinketh of the white and rede,  
That of his throte he maketh his privee,  
Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.

The apostel weping seith ful pitously,  
“Ther walken many of whiche yow told have I,  
I seye it now weping with pitous voys,  
That they been enemys of Cristes croys.  
Of whiche the ende is deeth; wombe is her god.”

O wombe! O bely! O stinking cod,  
Fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun!  
At either ende of thee foul is the soun.  
How greet labour and cost is thee to finde!

Thise cokes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde,  
And turnen substaunce into accident,  
To fulfille al thy likerous talent!  
Out of the harde bones knokke they the mary,  
For they caste nought a-wey that may go  
Thurgh the golet softe and swete;  
Of spicerye, of leef, and bark, and rote  
Shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt,  
To make him yet a newer appetyt.

But certes, he that haunteth swich delyces  
Is deed, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces.

A lecherous thing is wyn, and dronkenesse  
Is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse.

O dronke man, disfigured is thy face.  
Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace.  
And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun  
As though thou seydest ay “Sampsoun, Sampsoun”;

And one that’s drunken, save perhaps in this,  
That when a wretch in madness fallen is,  
The state lasts longer than doth drunkenness.

O glotonye, full of all wickedness,  
O first cause of confusion to us all,  
Beginning of damnation and our fall,  
If Christ redeemed us with His blood again!  
Behold how dearly, to be brief and plain,  
Was purchased this accursed villainy;  
Corrupt was all this world with glotonye!  
Adam our father, and his wife also,  
From Paradis to labour and to woe  
Were driven for that vice, no doubt indeed;  
The while that Adam fasted, as I read,  
He was in Paradis; but then when he  
Ate of the fruit forbidden of the tree,  
Anon he was cast out to woe and pain.  
O glotonye, of you we may complain!

Oh! knew a man how many maladies  
Follow on excess and on gluttonies,  
Surely he would be then more moderate  
In diet, and at table more sedate.

Alas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,  
Maketh that Est and West, and North and South,  
In erthe, in eir, in water men to-swinke  
To gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drinke!

Of this matere, O Paul, wel canstow trete:  
“Mete unto wombe, and wombe eke unto mete;  
And bothe shal God destroyen,” as Paulus seith.

Allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith,  
To seye this word, and fouler is the dede.  
Whan man so drinketh of the white and red,  
That of his throte he maketh his privee,  
Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.

The apostel, weping, seith ful pitously:  
“Ther walken many of which yow told have I;  
I seye it now weping with pitous voys,  
That they been enemys of Cristes croys.  
Of whiche the ende is deeth; wombe is her god.”

O wombe! O bely! O stinking cod,  
Fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun!  
At either ende of thee foul is the soun.  
How greet labour and cost is thee to finde!  
Thise cokes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde,  
And turnen substaunce into accident,  
To fulfille al thy likerous talent!

Out of the harde bones knokke they the mary,  
For they caste nought a-wey that may go  
Thurgh the golet softe and swete;  
Of spicerye, of leef, and bark, and rote  
Shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt,  
To make him yet a newer appetyt.

But certes, he that haunteth swich delyces  
Is deed, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces.

A lecherous thing is wyn, and dronkenesse  
Is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse.  
O dronke man, disfigured is thy face.  
Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace,  
And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun  
As though thou seydest ay “Sampsoun, Sampsoun”;

And yet God wot, Sampsoun drank nevere no wyn.  
Thou fallyest, as it were a stiked swyn;  
Thy tonge is lost, and al thy honest cure;  
For dronkenesse is verray sepulture  
Of mannes wit and of his discrecioun.

In whom that drinke hath dominacioun,  
He can no conseil kepe, it is no drede.  
Now kepe yow fro the white, and fro the rede,  
And namely fro the white wyn of Lepe,  
That is to selle in Fish-strete or in Chepe.

This wyn of Spayne crepeth subtilly  
In other wynes, growing fast by;  
Of which ther riseth swich fumositee,  
That whan a man hath dronken draughtes three,  
And weneth that he be at hoom in Chepe,  
He is in Spayne, right at the toun of Lepe,  
Nat at the Rochel, ne yet at Burdeux toun;  
And thanne wol he seye, “Sampsoun, Sampsoun.”

But herkneth, lordings, o word, I yow preye,  
That alle the sovereyn actes, dar I seye,  
Of victories in th’olde testament,  
Thurgh verray God, that is omnipotent,  
Were doon in abstinence and in preyere;  
Loketh the Bible, and ther ye may it lere.

Loke, Attila, the grete conquerour,  
Deyde in his sleep, with shame and dishonour,  
Bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse;  
A capitayn sholde live in sobrenesse.

And over al this, avyseth yow right wel  
What was comaunded unto Lamuel—  
Nat Samuel, but Lamuel, seye I—  
Redeth the Bible, and finde it expresly  
Of wyn-yeving unto hem that han justyse.  
Na-more of this, for it may wel suffyce.

And now that I have spoken of glotonye,  
Now wol I yow defenden hasardrye.  
Hasard is verray moder of lesinges,  
And of deceite, and cursed forsweringes,  
Blaspheme of Crist, manslaughtre, and wast also  
Of catel and of tyme; and furthermore,  
It is repreve and contrarie of honour  
To ben holde a commune hasardour.  
And ever the higher he is of estate,  
The more is he holden desolaat.

If that a prince useth hasardrye  
In alle governaunce and policye,  
He is, as by commune opinioun,  
Y-holde the lasse in reputacioun.

Stilbon, that was a wys embassadour,  
Was sent to Corinthe, in ful greet honour,  
Fro Lacidomie, to make hir alliaunce.  
And whan he cam, him happede, par chaunce,  
That alle the grettest that were of that lond,  
Pleyinge atte hasard he hem fond.

For which, as sone as it mighte be,  
He stal him hoom agayn to his contree,  
And seyde, “ther wol I nat lese my name;  
N’ I wol nat take on me so greet defame,  
Yowe for to allye unto none hasardours.  
Sendeth othere wyse embassadours;  
For, by my trouthe, me were lever dye,  
Than I yow sholde to hasardours allye.

For ye that been so glorious in honours  
Shul nat allyen yow with hasardours  
As by my wil, ne as by my tretee.”

This wyse philosophre thus seyde he.

Loke eek that, to the king Demetrius,  
The king of Parthes, as the book seith us,  
Sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn,  
For he hadde used hasard ther-bifore;  
For which he heeld his glorie or his renoun  
At no value or reputacioun.

Lordes may finden other maner pley  
Honeste y-nough to dryve the day awey.

Now wol I speke of othes false and grete,  
A word or two, as olde bokes trete.  
Gret swering is a thing abhominable,  
And false swering is yet more reprevable.  
The heighe God forbad swering at al,  
Witnesse on Mathew; but in special  
Of swering seith the holy Jeremye,  
“Thou shalt seye sooth thy othes, and nat lye,  
And swere in dome, and eek in rightwisnesse”;  
But ydel swering is a cursednesse.

Bihold and see, that in the firste table  
Of heighe Goddes hestes honorable,  
How that the seconde heste of his is this—  
“Tak nat my name in ydel or amis.”

Lo, rather he forbedeth swich swering  
Than homicyde or many a cursed thing;  
I seye that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth;  
This knowen, that his hestes understondeth,  
How that the second heste of God is that.

And forther over, I wol thee telle al plat,  
That vengance shal nat parten from his hous,  
That of his othes is to outrageous.

“By Goddes precious herte, and by his nayles,  
And by the blode of Crist, that it is in Hales,  
Seven is my chaunce, and thyn is cink and treye;  
By Goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye,  
This dagger shal thurgh-out thyn herte go”—  
This fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two,  
Forswering, ire, falsnesse, homicyde.

Now, for the love of Crist that for us dyde,  
Leveth your othes, bothe grete and smale;  
But, sirs, now wol I telle forth my tale.

Thise ryotoures three, of whiche I telle,  
Longe erst er pryme rong of any belle,  
Were set hem in a taverne for to drinke;  
And as they satte, they herde a belle clinke  
Biforn a cors, was caried to his grave;  
That oon of hem gan callen to his knave,  
“Go bet,” quod he, “and axe redily,  
What cors is this that passeth heer forby;  
And look that thou reporte his name wel.”

“Sir,” quod this boy, “it nedeth never-a-del.  
It was me told, er ye cam heer, two houres;  
He was, pardee, an old felawe of youres;  
And sodeynly he was y-slayn to-night,  
For-dronke, as he sat on his bench upright;  
Ther cam a privee theef, men clepeth Deeth,  
That in this contree al the peple sleeth,  
And with his spere he smoot his herte a-two.

And went his wey withouten wordes mo.  
He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence;  
And, maister, er ye come in his presence,  
Me thinketh that it were necessarie  
For to be war of swich an adversarie:  
Beth redy for to mete him evermore.  
Thus taughte me my dame, I sey na-more.”

“By seinte Marie,” seyde this taverner,  
“The child seith sooth, for he hath slayn this yeer  
Henne over a myle, within a greet village,  
Both man and womman, child and hyne and page.  
I trowe his habitacioun be there;  
To been avysed greet wisdom it were,  
Er that he dide a man a dishonour.”

“Ye, goddes armes,” quod this ryotour,  
“Is it swich peril with him for to mete?  
I shal him seke by wey and eek by strete,  
I make avow to goddes digne bones!  
Herkneth, felawes, we three been al ones;  
Lat ech of us holde up his hond to other,  
And ech of us bicomen otheres brother,  
And we wol sleen this false traytour Deeth;  
He shal be slayn, which that so many sleeth.  
By goddes dignitee, er it be night.”

Togidres han thise three her trouthes plight,  
To live and dyen ech of hem for other,  
As though he were his owene y-boren brother.  
And up they sterte al dronken, in this rage,  
And forth they goon towardes that village  
Of which the taverner had spoke bifore,  
And many a grisly oth than han they sworn.  
And Cristes blessed body they to-rente—  
“Deeth shal be deed, if that they may him hente.”

Whan they han goon nat fully half a myle,  
Right as they wolde han troden over a style,  
An old man, and a povre, with hem mette.  
This olde man ful mekely hem grette,  
And seyde thus, “Now, lordes, God yow seel.”

The proudest of thise ryotoures three  
Answerde agayn, “What, carl, with sory grace,  
Why artow al forwrapped save thy face?  
Why livestow so longe in so greet age?”

This olde man gan loke in his visage,  
And seyde thus, “For I ne can nat finde  
A man, though that I walked into Inde,  
Neither in citee nor in no village,  
That wolde chaunge his youthe for myn age;  
And therfore moot I han myn age stille,  
As longe tyme as it is Goddes wille.  
Ne deeth, alass! ne wol nat han my lyf;  
Thus walke I, lyk a restclees caityf,  
And on the ground, which is my modres gate,  
I knokke with my staf, bothe erly and late,  
And seye, ‘Leve moder, leet me in!  
Lo, how I vanish, flesh, and blood, and skin!  
Allas! whan shul my bones been at reste?  
Moder, with yow wolde I chaunge my cheste,  
That in my chambre longe tyme hath be,  
Ye! for an heyre clout to wrappe me!’  
But yet to me she wol nat do that grace,  
For which ful pale and welked is my face.

But, sires, to yow it is no curteisye  
To speken to an old man vileinye,  
But he trespasse in worde, or dies in dede.  
In holy writ ye may your-self wel rede,  
‘Agayns an old man, hoar upon his heed,  
Ye sholde aryse’; wherfor I yeve yow reed,  
Ne dooth unto an old man noon harm now,  
Na-more than ye wolde men dide to yow  
In age, if that ye so longe abyde;  
And God be with yow, wher ye go or ryde.  
I moot go thider as I have to go.”

“Nay, olde cherl, by God, thou shalt nat so,”  
Seyde this other hasardour anon;  
“Thou partest nat so lightly, by seint John!  
Thou spak right now of thilke traitour Deeth,  
That in this contree alle our frendes sleeth.  
Have heer my trouthe, as thou art his aspye,  
Tel wher he is, or thou shalt it abye,  
By God, and by the holy sacrament!  
For soothly thou art oon of his assent,  
To sleen us yonge folk, thou false theef!”

“Now, sirs,” quod he, “if that yow be so leef  
To finde Deeth, turne up this croked wey,  
For in that grove I lafte him, by my fey,  
Under a tree, and ther he wol abyde;  
Nat for your boost he wol him no-thing hyde.  
See ye that oak? Right ther ye shul him finde.  
God save yow, that boghte agayn mankinde,  
And yow amende!”— thus seyde this olde man.

And everich of thise ryotoures ran  
Til he cam to that tree, and ther they founde  
Of florins fyne of golde y-coyned rounde,  
Weigh ny an eighte busshels, as hem thoughte.

No lenger thanne after Deeth they soughte,  
But ech of hem so glad was of that sighte,  
For that the florins been so faire and brighte,  
That doun they sette hem by this precious hord.  
The worste of hem he spake the firste word.

“Brethren,” quod he, “tak kepe what I seye;  
My wit is greet, though that I bourde and pleye.  
This tresor hath fortune unto us yiven,  
In mirthe and jolitee our lyf to liven.  
And lightly as it comth, so wol we spende.  
Ey! Goddes precious dignitee! who wende  
To-day, that we sholde han so fair a grace?  
But mighte this gold be caried fro this place  
Hoorn to myn hous, or elles unto youres—  
For wel ye wot that al this gold is oures—  
Than were we in heigh felicitee.

But trewely, by day it may nat be;  
Men wolde seyn that we were theves stronge,  
And for our owene tresor doon us honge.  
This tresor moste y-caried be by night  
As wysly and as slyly as it mighte.  
Wherfore I rede that cut among us alle  
Be drawe, and lat see wher the cut wol falle;  
And he that hath the cut with herte blythe  
Shal renne to the toun, and that ful swythe,  
And bringe us breed and wyn ful prively.  
And two of us shul kepen subtilly  
This tresor wel; and, if he wol nat tarie,  
Whan it is night, we wol this tresor carie.”

That one of them the cuts brought in his fist,  
And bad them draw to see wher it might hil;  
And it fell on the youngest of them all;  
And so forth toward the town he went anon.

And just as sone as he had turned and gone,  
That one of them spoke thus unto the other:  
“You know well that you are my own sworn brother,  
So to your profit I will speak anon.  
You know well how our comrade is just gone;  
And here is gold, and that in great plenty,  
That’s to be parted here among us three.  
Nevertheless, if I can shape it so  
That it be parted only by us two,  
Shall I not do a turn that is friendly?”

The other said: “Well, now, how can that be?  
He knows well that the gold is with us two.  
What shall we say to him? What shall we do?”

“Shall it be secret?” asked the first rogue then,  
“And I will tell you in eight words, or ten,  
What we must do, and how bring it about.”

“Agreed,” replied the other, “Never doubt,  
That, on my word, I nothing will betray.”

“Now,” said the first, “we’re two, and I dare say  
The two of us are stronger than is one.  
Watch when he sits, and soon as that is done  
Arise and make as if with him to play;  
And I will thrust him through the two sides, yea,  
The while you romp with him as in a game,  
And with your dagger see you do the same;  
And then shall all this gold divided be,  
My right dear friend, just between you and me;  
Then may we both our every wish fulfill  
And play at dice all at our own sweet will.”

And thus agreed were these two rogues that day,  
To slay the third, as you have heard me say.

This youngest rogue who'd gone into the town, 

---

### Modern English (cleaned)

He would be the more temperate  
Of his diet, sitting at his table.

Alas! the short throat, the tender mouth,  
Which maketh that East and West and North and South,  
In earth, in air, in water men must swink  
To get a glutton dainty meat and drink!

Of this matter, O Paul, well canst thou treat:

“Meat for the belly and belly for the meat;  
And both shall God destroy,” as Paul doth say.

Alas! a foul thing it is, by my faith,  
To speak this word, and fouler is the deed.

When a man so guzzles of the white and red,  
That of his own throat he makes his privy,  
Through that cursed superfluity.

The apostle, weeping, says most piteously:

“For many walk, of whom I’ve told you, aye,  
I tell you now weeping with pitous voice,  
That they are enemies of Christ and of the Cross,  
Whose end is death; whose belly is their god.”

O gut! O belly! O thou stinking cod,  
Filled full of dung and of corruption found!  
At either end of thee foul is the sound.  
With how great cost and labour do they find  
Thy food! These cooks, how they pound and strain and grind;

Substance to accident they turn with fire,  
All to fulfill thy gluttonous desire!  
Out of the hard and riven bones knock they the marrow,  
For they throw naught away that may pass  
Through the gullet soft and sweet;  
With spicery, with leaf, bark, and root replete,  
Shall be the sauces made for thy delight,  
To furnish thee a sharper appetite.

But truly, he that such delights entices  
Is dead while yet he wallows in this vice.

A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness  
Is full of striving and of wretchedness.

O drunken man, disfigured is thy face,  
Sour is thy breath, foul art thou to embrace,  
And through thy drunken nose there comes a sound  
As if thou didst snore out “Samson, Samson”;

And yet God knows, Samson drank never wine.  
Thou fallest, as if thou wert a stuck swine;  
Thy tongue is loose, thy honest care obscure;  
For drunkenness is very sepulture  
Of any wit a man may chance to own.

In whom strong drink hath had dominion shown  
He can no counsel keep for any dread.  
Now keep you from the white and from the red,  
And especially from the white wine of Lepe  
That is for sale in Fish Street or in Cheap.

This wine of Spain it mixes craftily  
With other wines that chance to be near by,  
From which there rise such fumes, as well may be,  
That when a man has drunk two draughts or three,  
And thinks himself at home in Cheap,  
He finds that he’s in Spain, and right at Lepe—  
Not at Rochelle nor yet at Bordeaux town,  
And then will he snore out “Samson, Samson.”

But hearken, masters, one word more I pray:  
The greatest deeds of all, I'm bold to say,  
Of victories in the old testament,  
Through the True God, Who is omnipotent,  
Were gained by abstinence and after prayer:  
Look in the Bible, you may learn this there.

Lo, Attila, the mighty conqueror,  
Died in his sleep, in shame and dishonour,  
And bleeding at the nose for drunkenness;  
A great captain should live in soberness.

Above all this, advise yourself right well  
What was commanded unto Lemuel—  
Not Samuel, but Lemuel, say I—  
The Bible’s words you cannot well deny:  
Drinking by magistrates is called a vice.  
No more of this, for it may well suffice.

And now that I have told of gluttony,  
I’ll take up gambling, showing you thereby  
The curse of chance, and all its evils treat;  
From it proceeds false swearing and deceit,  
Blaspheming, murder, and—what’s more—the waste  
Of time and money; add to which, debased  
And shamed and lost to honour quite is he,  
Who once a common gambler’s known to be.

And ever the higher one is of estate,  
The more he’s held disgraced and desolate.  
And if a prince plays similar hazardry  
In all his government and policy,  
He loses in the estimate of men  
His good repute, and finds it not again.

Chilon, who was a wise ambassador,  
Was sent to Corinth, all in great honour,  
From Lacedaemon, to make alliance.  
And when he came, he noticed there by chance  
All of the greatest people of the land  
Playing at hazard there on every hand.

Wherefore, as soon as it might be,  
He stole off home again to his country,  
And said: “I will not thus debase my name;  
Nor will I take upon me so great shame  
You to ally with common hazarders.  
Send, if you will, other ambassadors;  
For by my truth, I say I’d rather die  
Than I should ally you to hazarders.

For ye that are so glorious in honours  
Shall never ally yourselves with hazarders  
By my consent, or treaty I have made.”

This wise philosopher thus said he.

Look e'en at Demetrius, lord of Parthia,  
As the book says, he sent a pair of golden dice  
In scorn for one who had been called a gambler;  
Thus he lost reputation and renown,  
Reduced to naught in value and in fame.

Great lords may find other manner of play  
Honest enough to while the day away.

Now will I speak of oaths, both false and great,  
A word or two, as old books treat.  
Great swearing is a thing abominable,  
And vain oaths yet more reprehensible.  
The High God forbade swearing at all,  
As witness Matthew; but in especial  
Of swearing says the holy Jeremiah,  
“Thou shalt not swear in vain, to be a liar,  
But swear in judgment and in righteousness”;  
But idle swearing is a wickedness.

Behold, in the first table of the Law,  
That should be honoured as High God’s, sans flaw,  
This second one of His commandments plain:  
“Thou shalt not take the Lord God’s name in vain.”  
Nay, sooner He forbids us such swearing  
Than homicide or many a wicked thing;  
I say that, as to order, thus it stands;  
’Tis known by him who His will understands  
That the great second law of God is that.

Moreover, I will tell you full and flat,  
That vengeance shall not leave his house  
Who in his swearing is too outrageous.

“By God’s own precious heart, and by His nails,  
And by the blood of Christ that’s now at Hales,  
Seven is my chance, and thine is five and tray!”  
“By God’s good arms, if thou dost falsely play,  
This dagger through thy heart I’ll stick for thee!”  
Such is the fruit of the wicked, bickering bones two:  
Perjury, anger, cheating, homicide.

Now, for the love of Christ, Who for us died,  
Forbear your oaths, both great and small;  
But, sirs, now will I tell to you my tale.

Now these three rioters, whereof I tell,  
Long before prime was rung by any bell,  
Were sitting in a tavern for to drink;  
And as they sat they heard a small bell clink  
Before a corpse that was being carried to his grave;  
Whereat one of them called unto his knave:

“Go run,” said he, “and ask them civilly  
What corpse it is that’s just now passing by,  
And see that thou report the man’s name well.”

“Sir,” said the boy, “it needs not that they tell.  
I learned it ere you came here, full two hours;  
He was, by God, an old comrade of yours;  
And he was slain, all suddenly, last night,  
When drunk, as he sat on his bench upright;  
An unseen thief, called Death, came stalking by,  
Who hereabouts makes all the people die,  
And with his spear he clove his heart in two,  
And went his way and made no more ado.

He’s slain a thousand with this pestilence;  
And, master, ere you come in his presence,  
It seems to me to be right necessary  
To be forewarned of such an adversary:  
Be ready to meet him for evermore.  
My mother taught me this, I say no more.”

“By holy Mary,” said the innkeeper,  
“The boy speaks truth, for Death has slain this year  
A mile or more hence, in a large village,  
Both man and woman, child and hind and page.  
I think his habitation must be there;  
To be advised of him great wisdom ’twere,  
Before he did a man some dishonour.”

“Yea, by God’s arms!” exclaimed this rioter,  
“Is it such peril, then, this Death to meet?  
I’ll seek him in the road and in the street,  
As I now vow to God’s own noble bones!  
Hear, comrades, we’re of one mind, as each owns;  
Let each of us hold up his hand to other,  
And each of us become the other’s brother,  
And we three will go slay this traitor Death;  
He shall be slain who’s stopped so many a breath,  
By God’s great dignity, ere it be night.”

Together did these three their pledges plight  
To live and die, each of them for the other,  
As if he were his very own blood brother.

And up they started, drunken in this rage,  
And forth they went, and toward that village  
Of which the innkeeper had told before;  
And so with many a grisly oath they swore,  
And Jesus’ blessed body once more rent—  
“Death shall be dead if we find where he went.”

When they had gone not fully half a mile,  
Just as they would have trodden over a stile,  
An old man, and a poor, with them did meet.  
This ancient man full meekly them did greet,  
And said thus: “Now, lords, God keep you and seal!”

The proudest of these three rioters replied,  
“What, churl of evil grace, why are you wrapped  
All but your face? Why live you so long in so great age?”

This ancient man looked upon his visage,  
And thus replied: “Because I cannot find  
A man, nay, though I walked from here to Ind,  
Either in town or country who’ll engage  
To give his youth in barter for my age;  
And therefore must I keep my old age still,  
As long a time as it shall be God’s will.  
Not even Death, alas! my life will take;  
Thus restless I my wretched way must make,  
And on the ground, which is my mother’s gate,  
I knock with my staff, early and late,  
And cry: ‘O my dear mother, let me in!  
Lo, how I’m wasted, flesh and blood and skin!  
Alas! When shall my bones come to their rest?  
Mother, with you fain would I change my chest,  
That in my chamber so long time has been,  
Aye! For a haircloth rag to wrap me in!’

But yet to me she will not show that grace,  
And thus all pale and withered is my face.

“But, sirs, to you it is no courtesy  
To speak to an old man vilainy,  
Unless in word he trespass or in deed.  
In holy writ you may yourself well read,  
‘Against an old man, hoar upon his head,  
You should arise’; wherefore I give you rede,  
Do no harm to an old man now,  
No more than you would that men do to you  
In age, if that you so long abide;  
And God be with you, whether you go or ride.  
I must go thither as I have to go.”

“Nay, ancient churl, by God, thou shalt not so,”  
Cried out this other hazarder anon;  
“Thou partest not so lightly, by Saint John!  
Thou spakst just now of that same traitor Death,  
That in this country kills all our friends.  
Hear my oath, since thou art his spy,  
Tell where he is or thou shalt rue it, aye,  
By God, and by the holy Sacrament!  
For soothly thou art one of his assent,  
To slay us young folk, thou false thief!”

“Now, sirs,” quoth he, “if ye be so leal  
To find Death, turn up this crooked way,  
For in that grove I left him, by my fay,  
Under a tree, and there he will abide;  
Nor for your boasts will he a moment hide.  
See ye that oak? Right there you shall him find.  
God save you, Who bought again mankind,  
And mend your ways!”— thus said this ancient man.

And every one of these three ran till he came  
To that tree; and there they found,  
Of florins of fine gold, new-minted, round,  
Well-nigh eight bushels, as they thought.

No longer then after Death they sought,  
But each of them so glad was of that sight,  
Because the florins were so fair and bright,  
That down they all sat by this precious hoard.  
The worst of them was first to speak a word.

“Brothers,” said he, “take heed to what I say;  
My wit is great, although I mock and play.  
This treasure Fortune unto us hath given  
That mirth and jollity our lives may liven,  
And lightly as it’s come, so will we spend.

Eh! By God’s precious dignity! who’d say,  
Today, that we should have so fair a grace?  
But might this gold be carried from this place  
Home to my house, or if you will, to yours—  
For well ye know that all this gold is ours—  
Then were we all in high felicity.

But certainly by day this may not be;  
For men would say we were robbers strong,  
And we’d, for our own treasure, hang ere long.  
This treasure must be carried home by night  
All prudently and slyly, out of sight.  
So I propose that cuts among us all  
Be drawn, and let’s see where the cut will fall;  
And he that gets the short cut, blithe of heart,  
Shall run to town at once, and to the mart,  
And fetch us bread and wine here, privately.

And two of us shall guard, right cunningly,  
This treasure well; and if he does not tarry,  
When it is night we’ll all the treasure carry  
Where, by agreement, we may think it best.”

That one of them the cuts brought in his fist,  
And bade them draw to see where it might fall;  
And it fell on the youngest of them all;  
And so, forth toward the town he went anon.

And just as soon as he had turned and gone,  
That one of them spoke thus unto the other:  
“You know well that you are my own sworn brother,  
So to your profit I will speak anon.  
You know well how our comrade is just gone;  
And here is gold, and that in great plenty,  
That’s to be parted here among us three.  
Nevertheless, if I can shape it so  
That it be parted only by us two,  
Shall I not do a turn that is friendly?”

The other said: “Well, now, how can that be?  
He knows well that the gold is with us two.  
What shall we say to him? What shall we do?”

“Shall it be secret?” asked the first rogue then,  
“And I will tell you in eight words or ten,  
What we must do and how bring it about.”

“Agreed,” replied the other, “Never doubt  
That, on my word, I nothing will betray.”

“Now,” said the first, “we’re two, and I dare say  
The two of us are stronger than is one.  
Watch when he sits, and soon as that is done  
Arise and make as if with him to play;  
And I will thrust him through the two sides, yea,  
The while you romp with him as in a game,  
And with your dagger see you do the same;  
And then shall all this gold divided be,  
My right dear friend, just between you and me;  
Then may we both our every wish fulfill  
And play at dice all at our own sweet will.”

And thus agreed were these two rogues that day,  
To slay the third, as you have heard me say.

This youngest rogue who’d gone into the town,

Up to her husband is this wife gone,  
and knocked boldly at his counting-room door.

"Qui est là?" said he.

"Peter! it is I," said she. "What, sir, how long will you fast? How long will you reckon and cast your sums and your books and your things? The devil take away all such reckonings!

You have enough, by God’s mercy; come down today, and let your bags stand. Are you not ashamed that Dan John shall be fasting all this day long? Come, let us hear Mass, and then let us dine."

"Wife," said this man, "little canst thou divine the curious business that we have. For of us chapmen, as God me save, and by that lord that is called Saint Yves, scarcely among twelve will ten thrive continually and last into old age. We must keep a good cheer and a fair visage, and drive the world as it may be, and keep our estate in secrecy until we be dead, or else go on pilgrimage or go out of the way.

Therefore have I great necessity to be advised in this quaint world; for evermore we must stand in dread of hap and fortune in our chapman-hood. To Flanders will I go to-morrow at day, and come again as soon as ever I may. For which, my dear wife, I thee beseech, be to every wight buxom and meek, and govern well our house. Thou hast enough in every manner that to a thrifty household may suffice. Thou lackest no array nor any victuals. Of silver in thy purse shalt thou not fail."

With that word he shut his counting-room door, and down he went; no longer would he tarry. Right hastily a Mass was said; the tables were spread, and they hastened to dinner. Richly the monk fed the merchant.

After dinner Dan John took this merchant apart privately and said to him, "Cousin, it stands so that I see well you will go to Bruges. God and Saint Augustine speed and guide you! I pray you, cousin, that you ride wisely; govern your diet temperately, especially in this heat. Between us two needs no strange fare. Farewell, cousin; God shield you from care. If any thing be by day or night, and it lie in my power and might that you would command me in any wise, it shall be done as you devise.

One thing, ere you go, if it may be, I would pray you: lend me a hundred francs for a week or two, for a certain cattle I must buy for stocking a little place of ours. So help me God, I would that it were yours! I will not fail you, come settling day, not for a thousand francs a mile away. But let this thing be secret, pray, for even to-night I must go buy these beasts. Farewell now, my own good cousin dear, and many thanks for your entertainment here."

This noble merchant, civilly, anon answered: "O cousin mine, Dan John, surely this is but a small request; my gold is yours and ever at your behest. Not gold only, but all my ware; take what you like, God shield that you should spare.

There's but one thing, which you know well enough of traders: their money is their plow. We may trade on credit while we have a name, but to be goldless is to lose the game. Pay it again when you are at your ease; in all I can, full fain am I to please."

These hundred francs he went and got anon, and privately gave them to Dan John. No one in all the world knew of this loan but the merchant and Dan John alone. They drank and talked and walked awhile and played, until Dan John set out for his abbey.

The morrow came and forth the merchant rode toward Flanders; his apprentice guided him until he came to Bruges happily. There this merchant went busily about his trade, buying and borrowing gold; he neither played at dice nor danced. Like a merchant he led his life, and there I let him dwell.

On the first Sunday after he had gone, Dan John returned to Saint-Denis with face and tonsure shining from a shave. All in the house was right glad, for my lord Dan John was come again.

Shortly to the point: this fair wife agreed with Dan John that for the hundred francs he should have her all night within his arms and bolt upright; and this agreement was performed in bed. In mirth all night a busy life they led until dawn, when Dan John went his way, bidding the household "Farewell!" and "Good-day!" No one in the town had the least suspicion of Dan John.

So forth he rode home to his abbey, or where he wished; no more of him I say.

This merchant, when the fair was ended, made ready to repair to Saint-Denis; with his wife he feasted and made cheer, and told her that since goods were very dear he needed more cash at his command for certain beasts that he most buy to stock a place that is theirs. "God help me so, I would it were yours! I shall not fail you on my day, not for a thousand francs a mile away. But let this be secret, I pray; yet to-night these beasts must I buy. Farewell now, my own cousin dear. Grant me mercy for your cost and your cheer."

This noble merchant gently answered anon, "O cousin mine, Dan John, surely this is a small request: my gold is yours when that it please you. Nor only my gold, but my merchandise; take what you list, God shield that you spare. But one thing you know well enough: of chapmen their money is their plow. We may have credit while we have a name; but to be goldless is no game. Pay it again when it lies in your ease; after my might full fain would I please you."

These hundred francs he fetched anon and privately took them to Dan John. No man in all the world wist of this loan, saving the merchant and Dan John alone. They drank and spoke and roamed awhile and played, until Dan John rode to his abbey.

The morrow came, and forth this merchant rode to Flanders—his prentice guiding him until he came into Bruges merrily.

Now this merchant went fast and busily about his need, buying and borrowing. He neither played at dice nor danced; but as a merchant, briefly to tell, he led his life, and there I leave him.

The Sunday next this merchant was gone, Dan John came to Saint Denis with crown and beard all fresh and newly shaved. In all the house there was no such little knave nor any other but was full fain, because my lord Dan John had come again.

Shortly to the point: this fair wife accorded with Dan John that for the hundred francs he should all night have her in his arms bolt-upright; and this accord was performed indeed. In mirth all night a busy life they led till it was day, and Dan John went his way and bade the household "Farewell, and have good day!" None of them, nor any wight in the town, had of Dan John any suspicion. He rode home to his abbey, or where he pleased; no more of him I say.

This merchant, when the fair ended, repaired to Saint Denis, and with his wife he made feast and cheer. He told her that chaffare (trade) was so dear that he must make a chevisaunce (a settlement) for he was bound in a reconissaunce to pay twenty thousand sheelds anon. For which he was to Paris to borrow of certain friends some francs; and he had some with him.

When he came into the town, out of great charity and affection he first went to Dan John to play, not to ask or borrow money, but to learn of his welfare and to tell him of his chaffare, as friends do when they meet. Dan John made him feast and merry cheer, and he told him especially how he had bought well and graciously—thanks be to God—all his merchandise, save that he must in all manner make a chevisaunce for his best, and then he would be in joy and rest.

Dan John answered, "Certes, I am fain that you in health are come home again. And if I were rich, as have I bliss, of twenty thousand sheelds you should not miss, for you so kindly the other day lent me gold; and as I can and may, I thank you, by God and by Saint James! But nevertheless I took unto our dame, your wife at home, the same gold again upon your bench; she wot it well, certain, by certain tokens that I can tell her.

Now by your leave I may no longer dwell; our abbot will out of this town anon, and in his company must I go. Greet well our dame, my own niece sweet, and farewell, dear cousin, till we meet."

This merchant, who was full ware and wise, obtained his loan and paid in Paris to certain Lombards the sum of gold and got his bond; home he went merry as a popinjay. He knew well his standing, that needs must he win in that voyage a thousand francs above all his costage.

His wife, all ready, met him at the gate, as she was wont; and all that night in mirth they were set, for he was rich and clear of debt.

When it was day this merchant embraced his wife anew and kissed her on the face; and up he went and made it full tough.

"Namore," said she, "by God, ye have y-nough!" And wantonly again with him she played, until at last this merchant said, "By God, I am a little wroth with thee, my wife, although it be me loath. And wot ye why? By God, as I guess, that ye have made a sort of strangeness between me and my cousin Dan John. Ye should have warned me ere I had gone that he to you had a hundred francs paid in ready token; and he held him ill appeased."

For he was bound by his own note of hand to pay some twenty thousand crowns anon. For which this merchant had to go to Paris to borrow. When he came to town, out of great charity he went first to Dan John, not to ask money but to see his welfare. Dan John made him merry cheer and told him how he had bought well, thanking God for his merchandise. Save that he must make a chevisaunce, and then he'd be at rest.

Dan John replied he was glad he was come home in health, and if he were rich he would have lent the twenty thousand; he thanked him for his previous loan, but had returned that gold to the merchant’s wife with tokens to prove it. He must now join his abbot and go; he bade his cousin greet his wife and farewell.

The merchant obtained his loan in Paris and returned home as merry as a jay, knowing he would make a profit. His wife met him at the gate and all night they made merry. Next day he embraced her and kissed her; she cried "No more, you have enough!" They played wantonly, and at last he said he was a little wroth with her, for she had not told him that Dan John had paid her a hundred francs in cash; Dan John seemed ill-pleased when he spoke of loans. The merchant pled he never thought to ask Dan John such a thing and charged his wife to tell him always in such matters, lest she repay a debtor in his absence and cause confusion.

This wife was not afraid but boldly answered: "Marry, I defy that false monk, Dan John! I kept of his tokens not one to tell. He brought me certain gold—that I know well! Evil to his friar’s snout! For I thought without doubt that he had given it me because of you, to advance my honour and yours, as cousinhood and for the good cheer he has often had here. But since I see our peace is thus disjoint, I will answer you shortly: you have slacker debtors than I! I will pay you well and readily from day to day; and if I fail, I am your wife—score it upon my tail, and I shall pay as soon as I may. By my truth I have, on new array and not on rubbish, spent every sou. Since I have spent it well for your honour, for God’s sake, be not wroth but let us laugh and play. My jolly body’s yours in pledge," she said, "By God, I will not pay you save in bed! Forgive me then, my own sweet husband dear; let us be happy now—turn over here!"

This merchant saw no remedy; chiding would be folly since the thing could not be amended. "Now, wife," he said, "I forgive you; but on your life, do not run so large; conserve our wealth hereafter—that I charge."

Thus ends my tale, and may the good God send tales fair enough until our lives shall end! Amen.

The holy monk, this abbot, so say I,  
The tonge out-caughte, and toke awey the greyn;  
And he yaf up the goost ful softly.  
And whan this abbot had this wonder seyn,  
His sake teres trikled doun as reyn,  
And gruf he fil al plat upon the grounde,  
And stille he lay as he hadde been y-bounde.  
The covent eek lay on the pavement,  
Weeping, and herien Cristes moder dere.  
And after that they rise, and forth ben went,  
And toke awey this martir fro his bere,  
And in a tombe of marbul-stones clere  
Enclosen they his litel body swete;  
Ther he is now — God leve us for to mete.  
O yonge Hugh of Lincoln, slayn also  
By cursed Jewes, as it is notable,  
Since it nis but a litel while ago;  
Preye eek for us, we sinful folk unstable,  
That of his mercy God so merciable  
On us his grete mercy multiplye,  
For reverence of his moder Marye. Amen.

### HERE THE HOST STINTETH

## Prologue to Melibeus

“No more of this, for God’s high dignity!” exclaimed our host, “For you, sir, do make me so weary with your vulgar foolishness that, as may God so truly my soul bless, my two ears ache from all your worthless speech; now may such rhymes the devil have, and each! This sort of thing is doggerel,” said he.

“Why so?” I asked, “Why will you hinder me in telling tales more than another man, since I have told the best rhyme that I can?”

“By God!” cried he, “now plainly, in a word, your dirty rhyming is not worth a turd; you do naught else but waste and fritter time. Sir, in one word, you shall no longer rhyme. Let’s see if you can use the country verse, or tell a tale in prose — you might do worse — wherein there’s mirth or doctrine good and plain.”

“Gladly,” said I, “by God’s sweet tears and pain, I will relate a little thing in prose that ought to please you, or so I suppose, for surely, else, you’re contumelious.

It is a moral tale, right virtuous, though it is told, sometimes, in different wise by different folk, as I shall you apprise.

As thus: You know that each evangelist who tells the passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ says not in all things as his fellows do, but nonetheless, each gospel is all true, and all of them accord in their essence, howbeit there’s in telling difference.

For some of them say more, and some say less, when they His piteous passion would express; I mean of Mark and Matthew, Luke and John; yet, without doubt, their sentence is all one.

And therefore, masters all, I do beseech, if you should think I vary in my speech, as thus: that I do quote you somewhat more of proverbs than you’ve ever heard before, included in this little treatise here, to point the morals out, as they appear; and though I do not say quite the same words that you have heard before, yet now, I pray, blame me not; for in the basic sense you will not find a deal of difference from the true meaning of that tale polite after the which this happy tale I write.

And therefore hearken now to what I say, and let me tell you all my tale, I pray.”

### (Middle English Prologue to Melibeus)

“No more of this, for goddes dignitee!” quod our hoste, “for thou makest me so wery of thy verray lewednesse that, also wysly god my soule blesse, myn eres aken of thy drasty speche; now swiche a rym the devel I byteche! This may wel be rym dogerel,” quod he.

“Why so?” quod I, “why wiltow lette me more of my tale than another man, sin that it is the beste rym I can?”

“By god,” quod he, “for pleynly, at a word, thy drasty ryming is nat worth a tord! Thou doost nought elles but despendest tyme. Sir, at o word, thou shalt no lengere ryme. Lat see wher thou canst tellen aught in geste, or telle in prose somwhat at the leste in which ther be some mirthe or som doctryne.”

“Gladly,” quod I, “by goddes swete pyne, I wol yow telle a litel thing in prose, that oghte lyken yow, as I suppose, or dies, certes, ye been to daungerous.

It is a moral tale vertuous, al be it told som-tyme in sondry wyse of sondry folk, as I shal yow devyse.

As thus; ye woot that every evangelist, that telleth us the peyne of Jesu Crist, ne saith nat al thing as his felaw dooth, but natheles, hir sentence is al sooth, and alle acordcn as in hir sentence, al be ther in hir telling difference.

Therefore, lordynges alle, I yow biseche, if that ye thinke I varie as in my speche, as thus, though that I telle som-what more of proverbes than ye han herd bifore, comprehended in this litel tretis here, to enforce with the effect of my matere, and though I nat the same wordes seye as ye han herd, yet to yow alle I preye, blameth me nat; for, as in my sentence, ye shul not fynde moche difference fro the sentence of this tretis lite after the which this mery tale I wryte.

And therfor herkneth what that I shal seye. And lat me tellen al my tale, I preye.”

## The Tale of Melibeus

### (Modernized Prose)

1. A young man named Melibeus, mighty and rich, begot on Prudence, his wife, a daughter who was called Sophie.

2. It happened one day that, for his amusement, he went into the fields to play. His wife and daughter remained at home, the doors of his house being all fast shut and locked. But three of his old enemies, having spied out the state of things, set ladders to the wall of the house and entered therein by the windows; and they beat the wife and wounded the daughter with five dangerous wounds in five different places; that is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her nose, and in her mouth; and they left her for dead and went away.

3. When Melibeus returned to his house and saw all this mischief, he, like a madman, rending his clothes, began to weep and cry.

4. Prudence his wife, so far as she dared, besought him to cease his weeping; nevertheless he wept and cried the more.

5. This noble wife Prudence remembered then the opinion of Ovid, in his book *The Remedy of Love*, wherein he says: “He is but a fool who interferes with the mother weeping for the death of her child, until she shall have wept her fill, and for a certain time; and only then may a man with amiable words comfort her, and pray her to forgo her weeping.” For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffered her husband to weep and cry for a time; and when she saw her opportunity she said to him thus: “Alas, my lord!” said she, “why make ye yourself like a fool? For soothly it befits not a wise man to make such sorrow. Your daughter, by the grace of God, shall be healed and escape. And all though she were dead now, ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy. Seneca says: ‘The wise man shall not take to excess of grief for the death of his children, but certainly he should suffer it in patience, even as he waits the death of his own person.’”

6. Melibeus answered anon and said, “What man should cease his weeping that hath so great a cause to weep? Jesus Christ our Lord himself wept for the death of Lazarus his friend.” Prudence answered, “Certes, well I wot, temperate weeping is nothing forbidden to him that is sorrowful among sorrowing folk; but it is rather granted him to weep. The Apostle Paul unto the Romans writeth, ‘Man shall rejoice with them that make joy, and weep with such folk as weep.’ But though temperate weeping be granted, outrageous weeping certainly is forbidden. Measure of weeping should be considered according to the lore that teacheth us Seneca. ‘When thy friend is dead,’ quoth he, ‘let not thyne eyes be too moist with tears, nor too much dry; although the tears come to thyne eyes, let them not fall.’ And when thou hast forgoon thy friend, do diligence to get another friend; and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend that thou hast lost; for therein is no remedy. And therefore, if ye govern yourself by sapience, put away sorrow out of your heart. Remember that Jesus son of Sirach sayeth: ‘A man that is joyous and glad in heart, it him preserveth flourishing in his age; but soothly sorrowful heart maketh his bones dry.’ He saith also thus: ‘That sorrow in heart sleeth full many a man.’ Solomon saith: ‘That, right as moths in the sheep’s fleece annoy the clothes, and the small worms the tree, right so annoyeth sorrow the heart.’ Wherefore we ought, as well in the death of our children as in the loss of our temporal goods, to have patience.

7. Remember upon the patient Job, when he had lost his children and his temporal substance, and in his body endured and received full many a grievous tribulation; yet said he thus: ‘Our Lord gave it me, our Lord hath biraft it me; right as our Lord would, right so it is done; blessed be the name of our Lord.’” To these aforesaid things Melibeus answered unto his wife Prudence: “All thy words be true, and thereto profitable; but truly my heart is troubled with this sorrow so grievously, that I know not what to do.”

8. “Let call,” said Prudence, “thy true friends all, and thy lineage which be wise; tell them thy case, and hearken what they say in counsel, and govern thyself after their sentence. Solomon saith: ‘Work all thy things by counsel, and thou shalt never repent.’”

9. Then, by the counsel of his wife Prudence, Melibeus let call a great congregation of folk: surgeons, physicians, old men and young, and some of his old enemies reconciled as by their semblance to his love and into his grace; and there-with-al there came some neighbors that did him reverence more for dread than for love, as it happeneth often. There came also many subtle flatterers, and wise advocates learned in the law.

10. And when this folk together assembled were, Melibeus, in sorrowful wise, showed them his case; and by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bore a cruel ire, ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and suddenly desired that the war should begin; but nevertheless he asked their counsel upon this matter. A surgeon, by licence and assent of such as were wise, arose and said to Melibeus as ye may hear.

11. “Sir,” quoth he, “as to us surgeons appertaineth that we do to every wight the best that we can, where we have been withholden, and to our patients that we do no damage; wherefore it happeneth many time and often that when two men have everich wounded other, the one same surgeon healeth them both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to norice war, nor parties to support. But certes, as to the healing of your daughter, although she be perilously wounded, we shall do such diligent business from day to night that with the grace of God she shall be whole and sound as soon as possible.” Almost in like wise the physicians answered, save that they said a few words more: “That, right as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall men heal war by vengeance.” His neighbors, full of envy, his feigned friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers made semblance of weeping, and empired and aggregated much of this matter, praising greatly Melibeus for might, for power, for riches, and for friends, despising the power of his adversaries, and said outright that he should anon wreak himself on his foes and begin war.

12. Up rose then an advocate that was wise, by leave and by counsel of others that were wise, and said: “Lordinges, the need for which we be assembled in this place is a full heavy thing and a high matter, because of the wrong and of the wickedness that hath been done, and eke by reason of the great damages that in time coming may fall for this same cause; and eke by reason of the great richesse and power of the parties both; for the which reasons it were a full great peril to err in this matter. Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our sentence: we counsel thee above all things, that right anon thou do thy diligence in keeping of thy proper person, in such a wise that thou ne want no espy nor watch, thy body for to save. And after that we counsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garnison, so that they may as well thy body as thine house defend. But certes, to move war, or suddenly to do vengeance, we may not deem in so little time that it were profitable. Wherefore we ask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem. For the common proverb saith thus: ‘He that soon deemeth shall soon repent.’ And eke men say that that judge is wise that soon understandeth a matter and judgeth by leisure. For although all tarrying be hated of folk, and though the desire of vengeance be natural, yet it is wisdom to deliberate.”

3. Whan Melibeus retourned was into his hous, and saugh al this meschief, he, lyk a mad man, fyndinge his clothes, gan to wepe and crye.

4. Prudence his wife, as ferforth as she dorste, bisoghte him of his weping for to stinte; but nat for-thy he gan to crye and wepen ever lenger the more.

5. This noble wife Prudence remembered hir upon the sentence of Ovide, in his book that cleped is *The Remedie of Love*, wheras he seith: “He is a fool that destourbeth the moder to wepen in the deeth of hir child, til she have wept hir fille, as for a certein time; and than shall man do his diligence with amiable wordes hir to reconforte, and preye hir of hir weping for to stinte.” For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffred hir housbond for to wepe and crye as for a certein space; and whan she saugh hir tyme, she seyde him in this wise. “Alas, my lord,” quod she, “why make ye your-self for to be lyk a fool? For sothe, it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swich a sorwe. Your doughter, with the grace of God, shal warisshe and escape. And al were it so that she right now were deed, ye ne oghte nat for hir deeth your-self to destroye. Senek seith: ‘The wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the deeth of his children, but certes he sholde suffren it in pacience, as wel as he abydeth the deeth of his owene propre persone.’”

6. This Melibeus answerde anon and seyde, “What man,” quod he, “sholde of his weping stinte, that hath so greet a cause for to wepe? Jesu Crist, our lord, himself wepte for the deeth of Lazarus his frend.” Prudence answerde, “Certes, well woot, attempree weping is no-thing defended to him that sorweful is, amonges folk in sorwe, but it is rather graunted him to wepe. The Apostle Paul unto the Romayns writeth, ‘Man shal rejoice with hem that maken joye, and wepen with swich folk as wepen.’ But though attempree weping be ygraunted, outrageous weping certes is defended. Mesure of weping sholde be considered, after the lore that techeth us Senec. ‘Whan that thy frend is deed,’ quod he, ‘lat nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teres, ne to muche drey; althogh the teres come to thyne eyen, lat hem nat falle.’ And whan thou hast forgoon thy frend, do diligence to gete another frend; and this is more wisdom than for to wepe for thy frend which that thou hast lorn; for therinne is no bote. And therfore, if ye governe yow by sapience, put awey sorwe out of your herte. Remembre yow that Jesus Sirak seith: ‘A man that is joyous and glad in herte, it him conserveth flourishing in his age; but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye.’ He seith eke thus: ‘That sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man.’ Salomon seith: ‘That right as mothes in the shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes, and the smale wormes to the tree, right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte.’ Wherfore us oghte, as wel in the deeth of our children as in the losse of our goods temporals, have pacience.”

7. Remembre yow upon the pacient Job, whan he hadde lost his children and his temporal substance, and in his body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacioun; yet seyde he thus: “Our Lord hath yeven it me, our Lord hath biraft it me; right as our Lord hath wold, right so it is doon; blessed be the name of our Lord.” To these foresaid thinges answerde Melibeus unto his wife Prudence: “Alle thy wordes been sothe, and thereto profitable; but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe so grevously, that I noot what to done.”

8. “Lat calle,” quod Prudence, “thy trewe frendes alle, and thy linage which that been wys; telleth your cas, and herkneth what they seye in conseiling, and yow governe after hir sentence. Salomon seith: ‘Werk alle thy thinges by conseil, and thou shalt never repente.’”

9. Thanne, by the conseil of his wife Prudence, this Melibeus leet callen a greet congregacioun of folk; as surgienes, phisiciens, olde folk and yonge, and somme of his olde enemys reconciled as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his grace; and ther-with-al ther comen somme of his neighebores that diden him reverence more for drede than for love, as it happeth ofte. Ther comen also ful many subtile flatereres, and wyse advocats lerned in the lawe.

10. And whan this folk togidre assembled weren, this Melibeus in sorweful wise shewed hem his cas; and by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he bar a cruel ire, redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foos, and sodeynly desired that the werre sholde biginne; but natheles yet axed he hir conseil upon this matere. A surgien, by licence and assent of swiche as weren wyse, up roos and unto Melibeus seyde as ye may here.

11. “Sir,” quod he, “as to us surgienes aperteneth, that we do to every wight the beste that we can, wheras we been withholde, and to our pacientes that we do no damage; wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte, that whan twey men han everich wounded other, oon same surgien healeth hem bothe; wherefore unto our art it is nat pertinent to norice werre, ne parties to supporte. But certes, as to the warisshinge of your doughter, al be it so that she perilously be wounded, we shullen do so ententif bisinesse fro day to night, that with the grace of God she shal be hool and sound as sone as is possible.” Almost right in the same wise the phisiciens answerden, save that they seyden a fewe wordes more: “That, right as maladyes been cured by hir contraries, right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce.” His neighebores, ful of envie, his feyned frendes that semeden reconciled, and his flatereres, maden semblant of weping, and empeired and agreggeden muchel of this matere, in preising greetly Melibeus of might, of power, of richesse, and of frendes, despisinge the power of his adversaries, and seiden out rightly that he anon sholde wreken him on his foos and biginne werre.

12. Up roos thanne an advocat that was wys, by leve and by conseil of othere that were wyse, and seyde: “Lordinges, the nede for which we been assembled in this place is a ful hevy thing and an heigh matere, by cause of the wrong and of the wickednesse that hath be doon, and eke by resoun of the grete damages that in tyme coming been possible to fallen for this same cause; and eke by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the parties bothe; for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet peril to erren in this matere. Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our sentence: we conseille yow aboven alle thing, that right anon thou do thy diligence in keeping of thy propre persone, in swich a wise that thou ne wante noon espy ne wacche, thy body for to save. And after that we conseille, that in thyn hous thou sette suffisant garnisoun, so that they may as wel thy body as thyn hous defende. But certes, for to moeve werre, or sodeynly for to doon vengeaunce, we may nat demen in so litel tyme that it were profitable. Wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have deliberacioun in this cas to deme. For the commune proverbe seith thus: ‘He that sone demeth, sone shal repente.’ And eke men seyn that thilke juge is wys, that sone understondeth a matere and juggeth by leyser. For al be it so that alle tarying be hated of folk, and though the desire of vengeance be natural, yet it is wisdom to deliberate.”

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## The Tale of Melibeus

not become us to foment warfare nor to support factions. And certainly, as to the healing of your daughter, although she is dangerously wounded, we will be so attentive, by day and by night, that, with God’s grace, she shall be made sound and whole again, and that as soon as may be possible.”

Almost in the same words the physicians answered, save that they added: “Just as diseases are cured by their contraries, so shall men cure war by vengeance.”

His neighbours, full of envy, his false friends who feigned to be reconciled to him, and his flatterers, made a semblance of weeping; and they greatly aggravated the matter by praising Melibeus, speaking of his might, his power, his wealth, and his friends, and disparaging the strength of his enemies; and they said outright that very swiftly he should begin the war and wreak vengeance upon his foes.

Then arose an advocate, a wise man, by leave and advice of others who were wise, and said: “Masters, the matter—for which we are assembled here—is a heavy thing, and a high, what with the wrong and wickedness that have been done, and by reason of the great evil that may follow hereafter from this same cause; and, too, by reason of the great wealth and power of both parties. For all of these reasons it were dangerous indeed to err in this matter.

“Wherefore, Melibeus, this is our judgment: we counsel you above all things, that, without delay, you take steps to guard your own person in such wise that you shall lack neither spy nor watchman. And we counsel that in your house you establish a sufficient garrison, so that the house may be as well defended as you yourself. But, to say truth, as to initiating warfare in order to obtain a sudden revenge, we can give no opinion, in so short a time, on whether such a move will be profitable. Therefore we ask for leisure and time wherein to deliberate upon the matter more fully. For the common proverb runs, ‘Resolve in haste, in haste repent.’ And besides, men hold that he is a wise judge who quickly understands a case and leisurely pronounces thereupon. For though delay may be annoying, nevertheless it is not to be blamed when it is a question of rendering just judgments, or of securing vengeance, when the delay is both sufficient and reasonable. And that was shown, in example, by Our Lord Jesus Christ. For when the woman taken in adultery was brought into His presence, in order to learn what He would have them do with her, though He well knew what He would thereafter answer, yet would He not answer quickly, but deliberated; and He stooped down and wrote twice upon the ground. For all these reasons, we ask time in which to deliberate, and thereafter we will counsel you, by the grace of God, as to the most profitable course.”

Up started, then, all of the young folk at once, and the greater part of them scorned the counsel of the old wise men; and they raised a clamour and said that just as it is well to strike while the iron is hot, so should men wreak their vengeance while they are fresh in anger. And they all cried loudly, “War, war!”

Upon this, one of the old wise ones arose, and with his hand commanding silence and attention, he said: “Masters, there is many a man to cry ‘War, War!’ who yet knows but little of the meaning of it. War, in the beginning, has so high an entrance, and so wide, that every man may enter when he pleases, and may find war easily. But truly, what the end of war shall be is not so easy to know. For when a war is once begun, many an unborn child shall die in the womb because of the strife, or else shall be born into sorrow and die in wretchedness. Therefore, ere any war begins, men should take much counsel together and act only after much deliberation.”

But when this old man thought to reinforce his words with reasons, then well-nigh all the younger folk arose and began to heckle him and to break up his argument, bidding him cut short his remarks. For indeed, he that preaches to those who have ears but hear not makes of himself a nuisance. As Jesus son of Sirach says: “A tale out of season is as music in mourning.” Which is to say, it avails as much to speak to folk to whom the speech is annoying as to sing before one who weeps. And when this wise man understood that he lacked an audience, he sat down again, much confused. For Solomon says: “When there is none that will hear thee, cease to speak.” “I see well,” said this wise man, “that the proverb says truth, which runs, ‘Good counsel is wanting when it is most needed.’”

Again, Melibeus had in his council many men who said one thing in his private ear and spoke otherwise in general audience.

When Melibeus heard that the greater part of his councillors were agreed on war, straightway he showed himself in accord with them and confirmed their judgment. Then Dame Prudence, seeing that her husband shaped his course for war and revenge, humbly and after biding her time, said to him: “My lord, I beseech you as earnestly as I dare and can, that you go not too hastily in this matter; and for your own good give me a hearing. For Petrus Alfonsus says: ‘If one man do to another any good or any evil, let there be no haste to repay it in kind; for then will the friend remain friendly, while the enemy shall the longer fear.’ The proverb has it: ‘He hastens well who wisely can delay.’ And in foolish haste there is no profit.”

This Melibeus answered Prudence his wife: “I purpose not to work by your counsel, for many causes and reasons. For certainly every man would hold me then a fool; this is to say, if I, for your counselling, would change things that have been ordained and affirmed by so many wise men. Secondly I say that all women are wicked and none good. For ‘Behold, this have I found’ (saith the Preacher), counting one by one, to find out the account; ‘one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.’ And certainly, if I were to be governed by your counsel, it would seem that I had given to you over me the mastery; and God forbid that it so were. For Jesus son of Sirach says: ‘A woman, if she have mastery, is contrary to her husband.’ And Solomon says: ‘Never in thy life to thy wife, nor to thy child, nor to thy friend, give no power over thyself. For better it were that thy children ask of thy person things that they need than thou see thyself in the hands of thy children.’ And also, if I would work by your counselling, certainly my counsels must some time be secret, till it were time that they must be known; and this cannot be. For it is written, that ‘the jangling of women can hide nothing that they witen not.’ Furthermore, the philosopher says, ‘In wicked counsel women vanquish men’; and for these reasons I will not use your counsel.”

When Dame Prudence, very debonairly and with great patience, had heard all that her husband liked to say, then she asked of him licence for to speak, and said in this wise: “My lord, as to your first reason, certainly it may lightly be answered. For I say that it is no folly to change counsel when the thing is changed; or else when the thing seemeth otherwise than it was before. And moreover I say that though you have sworn and bidden to perform your enterprise, and nevertheless you waive to perform that same enterprise by just cause, men should not therefore say that you were a liar nor forsworn. For the book says that ‘the wise man maketh no lying when he turneth his courage to the better.’ And albeit that your enterprise be established and ordained by a great multitude of folk, yet there you need not accomplish that same ordinance unless it please you. For the truth of things and the profit are rather found in few folk that are wise and full of reason than among the great multitude where every man crieth and clatters as pleases him. Truly such multitude is not honorable.

“As to the second reason, where you say that ‘all women are wicked,’ save your grace, certainly you despise all women in this wise; and he that despises all displeases all, as the book says. And Seneca says that ‘Who-so has sapience will not despise any man; but he will gladly impart the knowledge that he can without presumption or pride. And for such things as he knows not, he will not be ashamed to learn and inquire of those lesser than himself.’ And, sir, that there has been many a good woman may lightly be proved. For certainly, sir, Our Lord Jesus Christ would never have condescended to be born of a woman if all women had been wicked. And thereafter, for the great worth that is in women, Our Lord Jesus Christ, when He had risen from death to life, appeared to a woman rather than to His disciples. And although Solomon says that he never found good in any woman, it follows not therefore that all women are wicked. For though he may never have found a good woman, surely many another man has found many a woman to be both good and true. Or perchance Solomon’s meaning was this: that so far as the highest virtue is concerned he found no such woman; which is to say that there is no one who has sovereign goodness and worth but God alone, as He Himself has caused to be recorded in His gospels. For there is no creature so good that he is not somewhat wanting in the perfection of God, Who is his Maker.

“Your third reason is this: you say that if you governed yourself by my counsel, it should seem that you had given to me the mastery and the lordship over your person. Sir, saving your grace, it is not so. For if it were so that no man should be counselled but only by those who had lordship and mastery over his person, men would not be counselled so often. For truly he that asks counsel of a purpose yet has free choice whether he will work by that counsel or not. And as to your fourth reason, where you say that ‘the jangling of women hath hid things that they wot not,’ as who should say that ‘a woman cannot hide what she knows’—sir, these words are to be understood of women that are janglers and wicked; of which women men say that three things will drive a man out of his house: smoke, the dripping of rain, and a wicked wife. And of such women Solomon says it were better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house. And, sir, by your leave, that am not I; for you have often enough assayed my great silence and my great patience; and also how well I can hide and heal things that men ought secretly to hide.

“And soothly, as to your fifth reason, where you say that ‘in wicked counsel women vanquish men,’ God wot that this reason stands here in no stead. For understand now, you ask counsel to do wickedness; and if you would work wickedness, and your wife restrains that wicked purpose and overcomes you by reason and by good counsel, certainly your wife ought rather to be praised than blamed. Thus should you understand the philosopher that says, ‘in wicked counsel women vanquish their husbands.’ And whereas you blame all women and their reasons, I shall show you by many examples that many a woman has been full good, and yet is; and their counsels full wholesome and profitable. And some men have said that ‘the counselling of women is either too dear or else too little of price.’ But albeit that many a woman is bad and her counsel vile and naught worth, yet have men found many a good woman, full discreet and wise in counsel.

“Lo, Jacob, by the good counsel of his mother Rebecca, won the benison of Isaac his father, and the lordship over all his brethren. Judith, by her good counsel, delivered the city of Bethulia in which she dwelt out of the hands of Holofernes, that had besieged it and would have utterly destroyed it. Abigail delivered Nabal her husband from David the king, that would have slain him, and appeased the ire of the king by her wit and by her good counsel. Esther by her good counsel greatly exalted the people of God in the reign of Ahasuerus the king. And the same bounty in good counselling of many a good woman may men tell. Moreover, when Our Lord had created Adam our forefather, He said in this wise: ‘It is not good that the man be alone; make we to him a help meet for him.’ Here may you see that if women were not good and their counsels good and profitable, Our Lord God of Heaven would never have wrought them nor called them help of man, but rather confusion of man. And there said once a clerk in two verses: ‘What is better than gold? Jasper. What is better than jasper? Wisdom. And what is better than wisdom? Woman. And what is better than a good woman? Nothing.’ And, sir, by many other reasons may you see that many women are good and their counsels good and profitable. And therefore, sir, if you will trust to my counsel, I shall restore to you your daughter whole and sound. And also I will do to you so much that you shall have honour in this cause.”

When Melibeus had heard the words of his wife Prudence, he said thus: “I see well that the word of Solomon is truth; he says that ‘Pleasant words are as honeycombs: for they give sweetness to the soul and health to the body.’ And, wife, because of thy sweet words, and also for that I have assayed and proved thy great sapience and thy great truth, I will govern me by thy counsel in all things.”

“Now, sir,” said Dame Prudence, “and since ye vouchsafe to be governed by my counsel, I will enform you how ye shall govern yourself in choosing of your counsellors. Ye shall first, in all your works, meekly beseech the high God that He will be your counsellor; and shape you to such entente that He give you counsel and comfort, as Tobit taught his son: ‘At all times bless the Lord thy God, and desire of Him that thy ways may be directed and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper.’ And look to it that all your counsels are in Him for evermore. Saint James also says: ‘If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.’ And after that, then shall you take counsel within yourself, and examine well your thoughts concerning all things that seem to be the best for your own profit. And then shall you drive from your heart three things that are opposed to the following of good counsel, and they are anger, covetousness, and hastiness.

“First, he that takes counsel within himself certainly must be free from anger, and this for many reasons. The first one is this: He that has great ire and wrath within himself thinks always that he is capable of doing things that he cannot do. Secondly, ...”

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE TALE OF MELIBEUS

He that is angry and full of wrath cannot think or judge well, and he that cannot judge well cannot well advise. The third reason is this: That “he that is angry,” as says Seneca, “can speak only to berate and blame.” And thus with his vicious words he drives others into a like state.

“And too, sir, you must drive covetousness out of your heart. For the Apostle says that ‘The love of money is the root of all evil.’ And, trust me, a covetous man cannot judge correctly, nor can he think well, save only to the furtherance of his covetousness; and that, in truth, can never really be accomplished, because the richer he becomes, the greater desire has he for yet a larger abundance.

“And, sir, you must drive hastiness out of your inmost heart. For certain it is that you cannot hold to be best the sudden thought that comes into your heart, but you must weigh it and advise upon it. For, as you have heard before, the common proverb has it that he who resolves in haste soon repents. Sir, you are not always in like mood and of a like disposition; for surely that which at one time seems good to you, at another appears to be quite the contrary.

“When you have taken counsel within yourself, and have, after due deliberation, deemed such or such a thing to be for the best, then, I advise you, keep it secret. Reveal not your intentions to any person, save to such as you may certainly know will be of help to render your position more tenable through such revelation. For Jesus son of Sirach says:

> “Whether it be to a friend or a foe, talk not of other men's lives; and if thou canst without offense, reveal them not. For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee.”

And another writer says: “Hardly shalt thou find one person who can keep secrets.” The Book says:

> “While thou dost keep thy counsel in thine own heart, thou keepest it imprisoned; and when thou revealest it to anyone, he holdeth thee imprisoned.”

And therefore it is better that you hide your thoughts within your own heart than pray to him to whom you have told them that he will be close and keep silence. For Seneca says: “If thou canst not keep thine own counsel, how darest thou beg of another that he will do so?” But, nevertheless, if you deem certainly that the revealing of your secret to anyone will better your condition, then tell it to him in this wise. First, you shall give no indication whether you prefer peace or war, or this or that, and show him not your will and intent; for, trust me, counsellors are commonly flatterers, especially the counsellors of great lords. For they are at pains always to speak pleasantly, inclining toward the lord’s desire, rather than to use words that are, in themselves, true and profitable. And therefore men say that the rich man rarely receives good counsel, save as he has it from himself.

“And after that, you shall consider your friends and your enemies. Touching your friends, you must consider which of them are most faithful and most wise, and oldest and most approved in counselling. And of them shall you ask counsel, as the case requires.

“I say that first you must call into council such of your friends as are true. For Solomon says: ‘Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.’ He says also: ‘Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.’ For certain it is that neither gold nor silver are worth so much as the goodwill of a true friend. Again he says: ‘A faithful friend is a strong defence; and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure.’

“Then, too, shall you consider whether your real friends are discreet and wise. For the Book says: ‘Stand in the multitude of the elders, and cleave unto him that is wise.’ And for this reason you should call to your council of your friends those who have arrived at a proper age, those who have seen and experienced many things, and who have been approved in parliaments. For the Book says: ‘With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.’ And Tullius says: ‘Great things are not accomplished by strength and activity of body, but by counsel, authority, and knowledge; and these things do not become enfeebled with age, but rather grow stronger and increase day after day.’

“And then you shall keep this for a general rule. First, you shall call to your council but a few of your most special friends. For Solomon says: ‘Have thou many friends, but of a thousand choose but one to be thy councillor.’ And although you should, at the first, tell your secrets to but a few, afterward you may tell them to others, if there be need. But look to it always that your councillors have the three attributes that I have mentioned, namely: that they are true, wise, and experienced. And act not always, and in every need, by the advice of one councillor alone; for sometimes it is well to have the advice of many. Says Solomon: ‘Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of councillors they are established.’

“Now that I have told you of the sort of folk by whom you should be counselled, I will teach you which sort of counsel you ought to eschew. First, you shall avoid the counselling of fools. For Solomon says: ‘Consult not with a fool, for he cannot keep counsel.’ It is said in a book that the characteristic of a fool is this: he readily believes evil of everyone, and as readily believes all good of himself. Thou shalt also eschew the counselling of all flatterers, such as force themselves rather to praise thy person than to tell thee the truth about things.

“Wherefore Tullius says, that of all the pestilences of friendship, the greatest is flattery. And so it has more needful that thou eschew and fear flatterers than any other kind of men. The Book says that one should rather flee from and fear the sweet words of flatterers than the earnest words of the friend who tells the truth. Solomon says that the words of a flatterer are a snare wherewith to catch innocents. He says also, that he who speaks sweet words to his friend sets before his feet a net to catch him. And therefore says Tullius Cicero: ‘Incline not thine ears to flatterers, nor take counsel of flattering words.’ And Cato says: ‘Be well advised, and avoid sweet and pleasant words.’ And thou must also eschew the counsels of such of thy former enemies as have become reconciled to thee. The Book says that no one can safely trust the goodwill of a former enemy. And Aesop says: ‘Trust not to those with whom you have been sometime at war or in enmity, neither tell them of your intentions.’ And Seneca tells us the reason for this. ‘It may not be,’ says he, ‘that where fire has long existed there shall remain no vapour of heat.’ And thereto says Solomon: ‘The kisses of an enemy are deceitful.’ For, certainly, though your enemy may be reconciled, and appear before you in all humility, and bow his head to you, you should never trust him. Surely he feigns this humility more for his advantage than for any love of you; for he thinks to gain some victory over you by such feigning, which he could not gain by strife of open war. And Petrus Alfonsus says: ‘Have no fellowship with ancient foes; for if you do good to them, they will pervert it into evil.’ And, too, you must eschew the advice of those who are your own servants and bear themselves toward you with all reverence; for perchance they speak more out of fear than for love. And therefore says a philosopher thus: ‘There is no one perfectly true to him of whom he is afraid.’ And Tullius says: ‘There is no power of any emperor fitted to endure, save it be founded more in the love of the people than in the fear.’ You must also avoid the counselling of drunkards; for they can retain nothing. Solomon says that there is no secrecy where drunkenness reigns. You should also suspect the counsels of those who advise you privately to one thing and to a contrary thing in public. For Cassiodorus says that it is but an artifice to hinder when a man does one thing openly and its contrary in private. You should also hold suspect the counselling of the wicked. For the Book says that the advice of the wicked is always full of fraud. And David says that he is a happy man who has not followed the counselling of villains. You should also avoid and shun the advice of the young; for their counsel is not mature.

Now, sir, that I have shown you from which folk you may take counsel, and what counsel you may accept and follow, now will I teach you how that counsel should be examined, according to the doctrines of Tullius. In bringing a counsellor to the test, you must consider many things. First, thou shalt consider that, in this very thing that thou purposest, and upon what thing thou wilt have counsel, that very truth be said and conserved; this is to say, tell truly thy tale. For he that says false may not well be counselled in that case of which he lies. And after this, thou shalt consider the things that accord to that thou purposest to do by thy counsellors, if reason accord thereto; and eke, if thy might may attain thereto; and if the greater part and the better part of thy counsellors accord thereto, or no. Then shalt thou consider what thing shall follow of that counselling; as hate, peace, war, grace, profit, or damage; and many other things. And in all these things thou shalt choose the best, and weigh all other things. Then shalt thou consider of what root is engendered the matter of thy counsel, and what fruit it may conceive and engender. Thou shalt eke consider all these causes, from whence they have sprung. And when ye have examined your counsel as I have said, and which part is the better and more profitable, and hast approved it by many wise folk and elders, then shalt thou consider if thou mayst perform it and make of it a good end. For certes, reason will not that any man should begin a thing, but if he might perform it as he ought. Nor should any wight take upon him so heavy a charge that he might not bear it. For the proverb says: ‘He that too much embraceth, restraineth little.’ And Cato says: ‘Assay to do such things as thou hast power to do, lest the charge oppress thee so sore, that thee behoveth to leave the thing that thou hast begun.’ And if so be that thou be in doubt whether thou mayst perform a thing or not, choose rather to suffer than begin. And Petrus Alfonsus says: ‘If thou hast might to do a thing of which thou must repent thee, it is better “nay” than “ye”;’ this is to say, that it is better to hold thy tongue still than to speak. Then may ye understand by stronger reasons, that if thou hast power to perform a work of which thou shalt repent, then is it better that thou suffer than begin. Well say they that forbid every man to assay any thing of which he is in doubt whether he may perform it or no. And after, when ye have examined your counsel as I have said before, and know well that ye may perform your enterprise, confirm it then sturdily till it be at an end.

Now it is reason and time that I show you when, and wherefore, that ye may change your counsel without your reproof. Soothly, a man may change his counsel and purpose when the cause for them is removed, or when a new condition arises. For the law says that new conditions demand new counsels. And Seneca says: ‘If thy plan be come to the ears of thine enemy, change thy plan.’ You may also change your plan if it develops that, through error or other cause, harm will ensue from following it. Also, if your counselling is dishonest, or comes of a false premise, change thy plan. For the law provides that all dishonest mandates are invalid. And plans may be altered if they are impossible of fulfilment, or may not well be performed.

“And take this for a general rule: That every counsel that is so rigorously established that it cannot be altered for any condition that may arise, I say that that counsel is vicious.”

This Melibeus, when he had heard all the doctrines of his wife, Dame Prudence, answered her thus: “Dame, so far you have well and agreeably taught me, in a general way, how I should govern myself in the choosing and in the rejecting of councillors. But now I would fain have you descend to the particular, and tell me how you like them and how they appear to you — I mean, the councillors who have been already chosen in the present need.”

“My lord,” said she, “I beg of you, in all humility, that you will not wilfully object to my reasons, nor allow anger to enter your heart, even though I should say things that must displease you. For God knows that, as for my intention, I speak to your best interest, your honour, and your advantage. And, truly, I hope that your benignity will take it all in patience. Trust me, your counselling in this case should not be called counselling, properly speaking, but only a motion to do folly; and you have erred in many ways.

“First and foremost, you have erred in the method and manner of assembling your councillors. For you should have called, at first, but a few, and thereafter, had there arisen a need, you might have called in more. But, indeed, you have suddenly called into council a great multitude of persons, all very burdensome and all very tiresome to hear. Also, you have erred thus: whereas you should have called into council only your true friends, elderly and wise, you have gathered here many strange men, and young men, false flatterers, reconciled enemies, and men who do you reverence without love. Again, you have erred in that you have brought with you into council anger, covetousness, and hastiness, the which three things are antagonistic to every honest and profitable parliament; nor have you voided nor destroyed them, either in yourself or in your councillors, as you ought to have done. You have erred, again, in that you have revealed your wishes to your councillors, and your desire to make war and obtain vengeance; they have learned from your speeches the thing toward which you incline, so that they are set to advise you in things that will please your will rather than to do you good. And in this they are no good councillors. But now will I tell you plainly what I think of them, one by one.”

## The Tale of Melibeus

26. And take this for a general reule, that every conseil that is affermed so strongly that it may nat be chaunged, for no condicioun that may bityde, I seye that thilke conseil is wikked.

27. This Melibeus, whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame Prudence, answerde in this wyse. “Dame,” quod he, “as yet in-to this tyme ye han wel and covenably taught me, as in general, how I shal governe me in the chesinge and in the withholdinge of my conseillours. But now wolde I fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial, and telle me how lyketh yow, or what semeth yow, by our conseillours that we han chosen in our present nede.”

28. “My lord,” quod she, “I biseke yow in al humblesse, that ye wol nat wilfully replye agayn my resouns, ne distempre your herte, thogh I speke thing that yow displese. For God wot that, as in myn entente, I speke it for your beste, for your honour and for your profite eke. And soothly, I hope that your benignitee wol taken it in pacience. Trusteth me wel,” quod she, “that your conseil as in this caas ne sholde nat, as to speke properly, be called a conseilling, but a mocioun or a moevyng of folye; in which conseil ye han erred in many a sondry wyse.

29. First and forward, ye han erred in th’assemblinge of your conseillours. For ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to your conseil, and after ye mighte han shewed it to mo folk, if it hadde been nede. But certes, ye han sodeynly cleped to your conseil a greet multitude of peple, ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to here. Also ye han erred, for there-as ye sholden only have cleped to your conseil your trewe freendes olde and wyse, ye han y-cleped straunge folk, and yong folk, false flaterers, and enemys reconsiled, and folk that doon yow reverence withouten love. And eek also ye have erred, for ye han broght with yow to your conseil ire, covetise, and hastifnesse; the whiche three thinges been contrariouse to every conseil honeste and profitable; the whiche three thinges ye han nat anientissed ne destroyed hem, neither in your-self ne in your conseillours, as yow oghte. Ye han erred also, for ye han shewed to your conseillours your talent and your affeccioun to make werre anon and for to do vengeance; they han espyed by your wordes to what thing ye been enclyned. And therfor han they rather conseilled yow to your talent than to your profit. Ye han erred also, for it semeth that yow suffyseth to han been conseilled by thise conseillours only, and with litel avys; wher-as, in so greet and so heigh a nede, it hadde been necessarie mo conseillours, and more deliberacioun to parfoume your emprise. Ye han erred also, for ye han nat examined your conseil in the for-sayd manere, ne in due manere as the caas requireth. Ye han erred also, for ye han maked no divisioun bitwixe your conseillours; this is to seyn, bitwixen your trewe freendes and your feyned conseillours; ne ye han nat knowe the wil of your trewe freendes olde and wyse; but ye han cast alle hir wordes in an hochepot, and enclyned your herte to the more part and to the gretter nombre; and ther been ye condescended. And sith ye wot wel that men shal alwey finde a gretter nombre of foies than of wyse men, and therfore the conseils that been at congregaciouns and multitudes of folk, ther-as men take more reward to the nombre than to the sapience of persones, ye see wel that in swiche conseillinges foies han the maistrie.”

Melibeus answerde agayn, and seyde: “I graunte wel that I have erred; but ther-as thou hast told me heer-bifom, that he nis nat to blame that chaungeth his conseillours in certein caas, and for certeine just causes, I am al redy to chaunge my conseillours, right as thou wolt devyse. The proverbe seith: that ‘for to do sinne is mannish, but certes for to persevere longe in sinne is werk of the devel.’ ”

30. To this sentence answerde anon dame Prudence, and seyde: “Examineth,” quod she, “your conseil, and lat us see the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably, and taught yow best conseil. And for-as-muche as that the examinacioun is ricedessary, lat us biginne at the surgiens and at the phisiciens, that first speken in this matere. I seye yow, that the surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in your conseil discreetly, as hem oughte; and in hir speche seyden ful wysly, that to the office of hem aperteneth to doon to every wight honour and profit, and no wight for to anoye; and, after hir craft, to doon greet diligence un-to the cure of hem whiche that they han in hir governaunce. And, sir, right as they han answered wysly and discreetly, right so rede I that they been heighly and sovereynly guerdoned for hir noble speche; and eek for they sholde do the more ententif bisinesse in the curacioun of your doghter dere. For al-be-it so that they been your freendes, therfore shal ye nat suffren that they serve yow for noght; but ye oghte the rather guerdone hem and shewe hem your largesse. And as touchinge the proposicioun which that the phisiciens entreteden in this caas, this is to seyn, that, in maladyes, that oon contrarie is varisshed by another contrarie, I wolde fayn knowe how ye understonde thilke text, and what is your sentence.”

31. “Lo, lo!” quod dame Prudence, “how lightly is every man enclyned to his owene desir and to his owene plesaunce! Lo,” quod she, “the wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in this wyse. For certes, wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse, ne vengeaunce to vengeaunce, ne wrong to wrong; but they been semblable. And therfore, o vengeaunce is nat varisshed by another vengeaunce, ne o wrong by another wrong; but everich of hem encreesceth and aggreggeth other. But certes, the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in this wyse: for good and wikkednesse been two contraries, and pees and werre, vengeaunce and suffraunce, discord and accord, and manye othere thinges. But certes, wikkednesse shal be varisshed by goodnesse, discord by accord, werre by pees, and so forth of othere thinges. And heer-to accordeth Seint Paul the apostle in manye places. He seith: ‘Ne yeldeth nat harm for harm, ne wikked speche for wikked speche; but do wel to him that dooth thee harm, and blesse him that seith to thee harm.’ And in manye othere places he amonesteth pees and accord.

32. Now as to the seconde point, wher-as your wyse conseillours conseilled yow to wamestore your hous with gret diligence, I wolde fayn knowe how that ye understonde thilke wordes, and what is your sentence.”

33. Melibeus answerde and seyde, “Certes I understonde it in this wise; that I shal wamestore myn hous with toures, swiche as han castelles and othere manere edifices, and armure and artelleries, by whiche thinges I may my persone and myn hous so kepen and defenden, that myne enemys shul been in drede myn hous for to approche.”

34. To this sentence answerde anon Prudence; “Wamestoring,” quod she, “of heighe toures and of grete edifices apperteneth somtyme to pryde; and eek men make heighe toures and grete edifices with grete costages and with greet travaille; and whan that they been accompliced, yet be they nat worth a stree, but if they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde and wyse. And understond wel, that the gretteste and strongeste garnison that a riche man may have, as wel to kepen his persone as his goodes, is that he be biloved amonges his subgetes and with his neighebores. For thus seith Tullius: that ‘ther is a maner garnison that no man may venquisse ne disconfite, and that is, a lord to be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple.’

35. Now sir, as to the thridde point; wher-as your olde and wise conseillours seyd, that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede, but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun; trewely, I trowe that they seyd right wysly and right sooth. For Tullius seith, ‘In every nede, er thou biginne it, apparaille thee with greet diligence.’ Thanne seye I, that in vengeance-taking, in werre, in bataille, and in wamestoring, er thou biginne, I rede that thou apparaille thee therto, and do it with greet deliberacioun. For Tullius seith: that ‘long apparailling bifom the bataille maketh short victorie.’ And Cassiodorus seith: ‘The garnison is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed.’

36. But now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by your neighebores, swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love, your olde enemys reconciled, your flaterers that conseilled yow certeyne thinges prively, and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie; the yonge folk also, that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon. And certes, sir, as I have seyd bifom, ye han greetly erred to han cleped swich maner folk to your conseil; which conseillours been y-nogh repreved by the resouns aforeseyd. But nathelees, lat us now descende to the special. Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius. Certes, the trouthe of this matere or of this conseil nedeth nat diligently enquere; for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas and vileinye, and how manye trespassours, and in what manere they han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileinye. And after this, thanne shul ye examine the seconde condicioun, which that the same Tullius addeth in this matere. For Tullius put a thing, which that he clepeth ‘consentinge,’ this is to seyn: who been they and how manye, and whiche been they, that consenteden to thy conseil, in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif vengeance. And lat us considere also who been they, and how manye been they, and whiche been they, that consenteden to your adversaries. And certes, as to the firste poynt, it is wel knowen whiche folk been they that consenteden to your hastif wilfulnesse; for trewely, alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat your freendes. Lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly your freendes as to your persone. For al-be-it so that ye be mighty and riche, certes ye ne been nat but allone. For certes, ye ne han no child but a doghter; ne ye ne han bretheren ne cosins germayns, ne noon other neigh kinrede, wherfore that your enemys, for drede, sholde stinte to plede with yow or to destroye your persone. Ye knowen also, that your richesses moten been dispended in diverse parties; and whan that every wight hath his part, they ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth. But thyne enemys been three, and they han manie children, bretheren, cosins, and other ny kinrede; and though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three, yet dwellen ther ynowe to wrecken hir deeth and to slee thy persone. And therfore thilke conseil is nat good ne avysable.

37. And therfore, my lord, lat us procede fynally and to that conclusion that Ouid and other olde clerkes assayen in this mater. Ye shul first calle to your conseil trewe and olde freendes and sage men, and shewe to hem the trouthe of your matere; and lat hem withouten compassioun deme and juge of your cause. And if they, after sondry demaundes and consideraciouns, demen that vengeance ought nat to ben taken, ne that werre is nat profitable, thanne lat yow suffise and hende yow to suffraunce. But if they demen that vengeance ought to ben taken, and that it is nedeful for your preservacioun and for the honour of God, thanne lat not your hastinesse or youre presumpcioun styren yow, but doo as they devyse with discrete counsel, and with such diligence and purveying as is aforeseyd.

Thus have I loosed and shewed yow the ordre and the maner how ye shul purvey and make assay of your conseil, and what thinges ye shul eschewe in the choosing and in the using of your counseillours; and God kepe yow that ye procede nat of avarice ne of ire, but of drede of God and for your right and for the common weal.”

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE TALE OF MELIBEUS

### Middle English

though so be that your kinrede be more siker and  
stedefast than the kin of your adversarie, yet nathe-  
lees your kinrede nis but a fer kinrede; they been  
but litel sib to yow, and the kin of your enemys been  
ny sib to hem. And certes, as in that, hir con-  
dicioun is bet than youres. Than lat us considere  
also if the conseilling of hem that conseilleden yow  
to taken sodeyn vengeaunce, whether it accorde to  
resoun? And certes, ye knowe wel ‘nay.’ For as  
by right and resoun, ther may no man taken venge-  
ance on no wight, but the juge that hath the  
jurisdiccioun of it, whan it is graunted him to take  
thilke vengeance, hastily or attemprely, as the lawe  
requireth. And yet moreover, of thilke word that  
Tullius clepeth ‘consentinge,’ thou shalt considere  
if thy might and thy power may consenten and  
suffyse to thy wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours.  
And certes, thou mayst wel seyn that ‘nay.’ For  
sikerly, as for to speke proprely, we may do nothing  
but only swich thing as we may doon rightfully.  
And certes, rightfully ne mowe ye take no venge-  
ance as of your propre auctoritee. Thanne mowe  
ye seen, that your power ne consenteth nat ne ac-  
cordeth nat with your wilfulnesse. Lat us now  
examine the thridde point that Tullius clepeth  
‘consequent.’ Thou shalt understonde that the  
vengeance that thou purposest for to take is the  
consequent. And therof folweth another venge-  
ance, peril, and werre; and othere damages with-  
oute nombre, of whiche we be nat war as at this tyme.  
And as touchinge the fourthe point, that Tullius clepeth  
‘engendringe,’ thou shalt considere, that this wrong  
which that is doon to thee is engendred of the hate  
of thyne enemys; and of the vengeance-takinge upon  
that wolde engendre another vengeance, and muchel  
sorwe and wastinge of richesses, as I seyde.

37. Now sir, as to the point that Tullius clepeth  
‘causes,’ which that is the laste point, thou shalt  
understonde that the wrong that thou hast receyved  
hath certeine causes, whiche that clerkes clepen *Oriens*  
and *Efficiens*, and *Causa longinqua* and *Causa propinqua*;  
this is to seyn, the fer cause and the ny cause. The fer  
cause is almighty God, that is cause of alle thinges.  
The neer cause is thy three enemys. The cause acci-  
dental was hate. The cause material been the five  
woundes of thy doghter. The cause formal is the manere  
of hir werkinge, that broghten laddres and cloumben in at  
thy windowes. The cause final was for to slee thy dogh-  
ter; it letted nat in as muche as in hem was. But for to  
speken of the fer cause, as to what ende they shul come,  
or what shal finally bityde of hem in this caas, ne can I nat  
deme but by conjectinge and by supposinge. For we shul  
suppose that they shul come to a wikked ende, by-cause  
that the Book of Decrees seith: ‘selden or with greet peyne  
been causes y-broght to good ende whanne they been  
baddely bigonne.’

38. Now sir, if men wolde axe me, why that God  
suffred men to do yow this vileinye, certes, I can  
nat well answere as for no sothfastnesse. For th’apostle  
seith, that ‘the scienes and the jugge-  
mentz of our lord God almighty been ful depe; ther  
may no man comprehende ne serchen hem suffi-  
ciently.’ Nathelees, by certeyne presumpeions and  
conjectinges, I holde and bileve that God, which  
that is ful of justice and of rightwisnesse, hath  
suffred this bityde by juste cause resonable.

39. Thy name is Melibee, this is to seyn, ‘a man  
that drinketh hony.’1 Thou hasty-dronke so muchel  
hony of swete temporel richesses and delices and  
honours of this world, that thou art dronken; and  
hast forgeten Jesu Crist thy creatour; thou ne hast  
nat doon to him swich honour and reverence as  
thee oughte. Ne thou ne hast nat wel y-taken kepe  
to the wordes of Ovide, that seith: ‘under the hony  
of the godes of the body is hid the venim that sleeth  
the soule.’ And Salomon seith, ‘if thou hast foun-  
den hony, ete of it that suffyseth; for if thou ete of  
it out of mesure, thou shalt spewe,’ and be nedy  
and povre. And peraventure Crist hath thee in  
despit, and hath turned awey fro thee his face and  
hise eres of misericorde; and also he hath suffred  
that thou hast been punisshed in the manere that  
thow hast y-trespassed. Thou hast doon sinne  
agayn our lord Crist; for certes, the three enemys  
of mankinde, that is to seyn, the flessh, the feend,  
and the world, thou hast suffred hem entre in-to  
thyn herte wilfully by the windowes of thy body,  
and hast nat defended thy-self suffisantly agayns  
hir assautes and hir temptaciouns, so that they han  
wounded thy soule in five places; this is to seyn,  
the deedly sinnes that been entred in-to thyn herte  
by thy five wittes. And in the same manere our  
lord Crist hath wold and suffred, that thy three  
enemys been entred in-to thyn hous by the win-  
dowes, and han y-wounded thy doghter in the  
fore-seyde manere.”

40. “Certes,” quod Melibee, “I see wel that ye  
enforce yow muchel by wordes to overcome me in  
swich manere, that I shal nat venge me of myne  
enemys; shewinge me the perils and the yveles that  
mighten falle of this vengeance. But who-so wolde  
considere in alle vengeances the perils and yveles  
that mighte sewe of vengeance-takinge, a man wolde  
never take vengeance, and that were harm; for by  
the vengeance-takinge been the wikked men dis-  
severed fro the gode men. And they that han wil  
to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos,  
whan they seen the punissinge and chastysinge of  
the trespassours.”

41. And to this answerde dame Prudence: “Certes,”  
seyde she, “I graunte wel that of vengeaunce cometh  
muchel yvel and muchel good; but vengeaunce-taking  
aperteineth nat unto everichoon, but only unto juges  
and unto hem that han jurisdiccioun upon the tres-  
passours. And yet seye I more, that right as a singuler  
persone sinneth in takinge vengeance of another man,  
right so sinneth the juge if he do no vengeance of hem  
that it han deserved. For Senek seith thus: ‘that maister,’  
he seith, ‘is good that proveth shrewes.’ And as Cassidore  
seith: ‘A man dredeth to do outrages, whan he woot and  
knoweth that it displeseth to the juges and sovereyns.’  
And another seith: ‘the juge that dredeth to do right,  
maketh men shrewes.’ And Seint Paule the apostle seith  
in his epistle, whan he wryteth unto the Romayns: that  
‘the juges beren nat the spere with-outen cause’; but  
they beren it to punisse the shrewes and misdoeres,  
and for to defende the gode men. If ye wol thanne take  
vengeance of your enemys, ye shul retoume or have your  
recours to the juge that hath the jurisdiccion upon hem;  
and he shal punisse hem as the lawe axeth and requyreth.”

42. “A!” quod Melibee, “this vengeance lyketh me  
no-thing. I bithenke me now and take hede, how  
fortune hath norissed me fro my childhede, and hath  
holpen me to passe many a strong pas. Now wol I  
assayen hir, trowinge, with Goddes help, that she shal  
helpe me my shame for to venge.”

43. “Certes,” quod Prudence, “if ye wol werke by my  
conseil, ye shul nat assaye fortune by no wey; ne ye  
shul nat lene or bowe unto hir, after the word of Senek:  
for ‘thinges that been folily doon, and that been in hope  
of fortune, shullen never come to good ende.’ And as the  
same Senek seith: ‘the more cleer and the more shyning  
that fortune is, the more brotil and the sonner broken she is.’  
Trusteth nat in hir, for she nis nat stidefast ne stable; for  
whan thow trowest to be most seur or siker of hir help,  
she wol faille thee and deceyve thee. And wheras ye seyn  
that fortune hath norissed yow fro your childhede, I seye,  
that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hir and in hir wit.  
For Senek seith: ‘what man that is norissed by fortune, she  
maketh him a greet fool.’ Now thanne, sin ye desyre and  
axe vengence, and the vengence that is doon after the lawe  
and bifore the juge ne lyketh yow nat, and the vengence  
that is doon in hope of fortune is perilous and uncertein,  
thanne have ye noon other remedie but for to have your recours  
unto the sovereyn juge that vengeth alle vileinyes and wronges;  
and he shal venge yow after that himself witnesseth, wheras  
he seith: ‘leveth the vengeance to me, and I shal do it.’”

44. Melibee answerde, “if I ne venge me nat of the  
vileinye that men han doon to me, I sompne or wame hem  
that han doon to me that vileinye and alle othere, to do me  
another vileinye. For it is writen: ‘if thou take no vengance  
of an old vileinye, thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee  
a newe vileinye.’ And also, for my suffrance, men wolden  
do to me so muchel vileinye, that I mighte neither bere it  
ne sustene; and so sholde I been put and holden over lowe.  
For men seyn: ‘in muchel suffringe shul manye thinges falle  
unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre.’”

45. “Certes,” quod Prudence, “I graunte yow that over  
muchel suffraunce nis nat good; but yet ne folweth it nat  
ther-of, that every persone to whom men do a rascaly may  
take of it vengance; for that aperteneth and longeth al only  
to the juges, for they shul venge the vileinyes and iniurics.  
And therfore tho two auctoritess that ye han seyd above,  
been only understonden in the juges; for whan they suffren  
over muchel the wronge and the vileinyes to be doon with-  
outen punisshinge, they sompne nat a man al only for to do  
newe wronges, but they comenanden it. Also a wys man seith:  
that ‘the juge that correcteth nat the sinnere comandeth and  
biddeth him do sinne.’ And the juges and sovereyns mighten  
in hir land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and misdoeres,  
that they sholden by swich suffrance, by proces of tyme, wexe  
of swich power and might, that they sholden putte out the juges  
and the sovereyns from hir places, and atte laste maken hem  
lesen hir lordshipes.

46. But lat us now putte, that ye have leve to venge yow.  
I seye ye been nat of might and power as now to venge yow.  
For if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the might of your  
adversaries, ye shul finde in manye thinges, that I have shewed  
yow er this, that hir condicioun is bettre than youres. And  
therfore seye I, that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient.

47. Forthermore, ye knowen wel that, after the comune  
sawe, ‘it is a woodnesse a man to stryve with a strenger or a  
more mighty man than he is himself; and for to stryve with a  
man of evene strengthe, that is to seyn, with as strong a man as  
he, it is peril; and for to stryve with a weyker man, it is folie.’  
And therfore sholde a man flee stryvinge as muchel as he mighte.  
For Salomon seith: ‘it is a greet worship to a man to kepen him  
fro noyse and stryf.’ And if it so bifalle or happe that a man of  
gretter might and strengthe than thou art do thee grevaunce, studie  
and bisie thee rather to stille the same grevaunce, than for to venge  
thee. For Senek seith: that ‘he putteth him in greet peril that stryveth  
with a gretter man than he is himself.’ And Catoun seith: ‘if a man  
of hyer estaat or degree, or more mighty than thou, do thee anoy or  
grevaunce, suffre him: for he that ones hath greved thee may another  
tyme releve thee and helpe.’ Yet sette I caas, ye have bothe might and  
licence for to venge yow. I seye, that ther be ful manye thinges that  
shul restreyne yow of vengeance-takinge, and make yow for to enclyne  
to suffre, and for to han pacience in the thinges that han been doon to yow.  
First and foreward, if ye wole considere the defautes that been in your  
owene persone, for whiche defautes God hath suffred yow have this tribu-  
lacioun, as I have seyd yow heer-bifom. For the poete seith, that ‘we oghte  
paciently taken the tribulacions that comen to us, whan we thinken and  
consideren that we han deserved to have hem.’ And Seint Gregorie seith:  
that ‘whan a man considereth wel the nombre of his defautes and of his  
sinnes, the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he suffreth semen the lesse  
unto hym; and in-as-muche as him thinketh hise sinnes more hevy and grevous,  
in-so-muche semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto him.’ Also ye  
owen to enclyne and bowe your herte to take the pacience of our lord Jesu  
Crist, as seith Seint Peter in hise epistles: ‘Jesu Crist,’ he seith, ‘hath suffred for us,  
and yeven ensample to every man to folwe and sewe him; for he dide never sinne,  
ne never cam ther a vileinous word out of his mouth: whan men cursed him, he  
cursed hem noght; and whan men betten him, he manaced hem noght.’ Also the  
grette pacience, which the seintes that been in paradys han had in tribulaciouns  
that they han y-suffred, with-outen hir desert or gilt, oghte muchel stiren yow to  
pacience. Forthermore, ye sholde enforce yow to have pacience, consideringe that  
the tribulaciouns of this world but litel whyle endure, and sone passed been and goon.  
And the joye that a man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable,  
after that the apostle seith in his epistle: ‘the joye of God,’ he seith, ‘is perdurable,’  
that is to seyn, everlastinge. Also troweth and bileveth stedefastly, that he nis nat wel  
y-norissed ne wel y-taught, that can nat have pacience or wol nat receyve pacience.  
For Salomon seith: that ‘the doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by pacience.’  
And in another place he seith: that ‘he that is pacient governeth him by greet prudence.’  
And the same Salomon seith: ‘the angry and wrathful man maketh noyses, and the pacient  
man atempreth hem and stilleth.’ He seith also: ‘it is more worth to be pacient than for to be  
right strong; and he that may have the lordshipe of his owene herte is more to preyse, than he  
that by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees.’ And therfore seith Seint Jame in his epistle:  
that ‘pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun.’

48. “Certes,” quod Melibee, “I graunte yow, dame Prudence,  
that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun; but every man  
may nat have the perfeccioun that ye seken; ne I nam nat of the  
nombre of right parfite men, for myn herte may never been in pees

### Modern English Translation

though so be that your kinrede be more secure and  
steadfast than the kin of your adversary, yet, nevertheless,  
your kinrede is but a distant kin; they are but little sib to you,  
and the kin of your enemies are nigh sib to them. And,  
certainly, as for that, their condition is better than yours.  
Then let us consider also whether the counselling of those who  
urged you to take sudden vengeance accords with reason.  
And certainly you know well the answer is ‘nay.’ For, by right  
and reason, there may be no man who takes vengeance upon any  
person, save the judge who has the jurisdiction of it; and when it  
is granted him to take such vengeance, whether hastily or slowly,  
as the law requires. And, moreover, concerning that word which  
Tullius calls ‘consenting,’ you shall consider whether your might  
and your power may consent and suffice to your wilfulness and to  
your councillors. And certainly you must answer ‘nay.’ For,  
surely, properly speaking, we may do nothing but such things as  
we may do rightfully. And, certainly, rightfully you may take no  
vengeance of your own authority. Thus you may see that your  
power does not consent nor accord with your wilfulness. Let us  
now examine the third point which Tullius calls the ‘consequence.’  
You shall understand that the vengeance which you propose to  
take is the consequence. And therefrom follows another vengeance,  
peril, and war; and other damages without number, of which we are  
not aware at this time. And touching the fourth point, which Tullius  
calls ‘engendering,’ you shall consider that this wrong done to you was  
engendered of the hate of your enemies; and of the vengeance taken  
upon that would be engendered another vengeance, and much sorrow  
and wastage of riches, as I have said.

37. Now, sir, as to the point that Tullius calls ‘causes,’ which is the last  
point, you shall understand that the wrong that you have received has  
certain causes, which clerks call *Oriens* and *Efficiens*, and *Causa longinqua*  
and *Causa propinqua*; that is to say, the remote cause and the proximate cause.  
The remote cause is Almighty God, Who is the Cause of all things. The near cause  
is your three enemies. The accidental cause was hate. The material cause was the  
five wounds of your daughter. The formal cause is the manner of their working, who  
brought ladders and climbed in at your windows. The final cause was to slay your  
daughter; it did not hinder them so far as lay in them. But to speak of the remote cause,  
as to what end they shall come, or what shall finally betide them in this case, I cannot  
judge, except by conjecture and supposition. For we must suppose that they shall come  
to an evil end, because the Book of Decrees says: “Seldom, and only with great pain,  
are causes brought to a good end when they have been badly begun.”

38. Now, sir, if men would ask me why God suffered men to do you this villainy,  
certainly I cannot answer with any certainty. For the Apostle says that the wisdom and  
judgments of our Lord God almighty are very deep; there may no man comprehend nor  
search them sufficiently. Nevertheless, by certain presumptions and conjecturings, I hold  
and believe that God, who is full of justice and righteousness, has permitted this to happen  
for a just and reasonable cause.

39. Thy name is Melibee, which is to say, ‘a man that drinks honey.’ You have drunk so  
much of the sweet honey of temporal riches and delights and honours of this world that  
you are drunken; and you have forgotten Jesus Christ your Creator; you have not done to Him  
such honour and reverence as you ought. Nor have you taken due heed of the words of Ovid,  
who says: “Under the honey of the good things of the body is hidden the venom that slays  
the soul.” And Solomon says: “If thou findest honey, eat of that which sufficeth; for if thou  
eatest of it beyond measure, thou shalt vomit,” and be needy and poor. And perchance Christ  
holds you in despite, and has turned away His face from you and shut up the ears of His mercy;  
and also He has permitted that you be punished in the manner in which you have trespassed.  
You have sinned against Our Lord Christ; for, certainly, the three enemies of mankind, namely  
the flesh, the fiend, and the world, you have wilfully suffered to enter into your heart through the  
windows of your body, and you have not defended yourself sufficiently against their assaults and  
temptations, so that they have wounded your soul in five places; that is to say, the deadly sins that  
entered into your heart by your five senses. In the same manner Our Lord Christ has willed and  
suffered that your three enemies entered into your house by the windows, and wounded your daughter  
in the foresaid manner.”

40. “Certainly,” said Melibeus, “I see well that you so strengthen your arguments that I shall not  
revenge myself upon my enemies, showing me thus the perils and the evils that may result from taking vengeance.  
But if anyone were to consider, in every revenge, the dangers and ills that might ensue therefrom, no man would ever  
take vengeance, and that would be harmful; for by vengeance-taking the wicked are severed from the good men. And they that  
have the will to do wickedly restrain their evil purpose when they see the punishment and chastisement of the transgressors.”

41. To this replied Dame Prudence: “Surely,” said she, “I grant that of vengeance cometh much evil and much good; but vengeance-taking appertains not to everyone, but only to judges and to those that have jurisdiction over the transgressors. And yet I say more, that just as a single person sins in taking vengeance upon another man, so sins the judge if he does not take vengeance on those who have deserved it. For Seneca says: ‘That master is good who proves the shrews.’ And as Cassiodorus says: ‘A man is deterred from crimes when he knows that they displease the judges and sovereigns.’ And another says: ‘The judge who fears to do right makes men wicked.’ And Saint Paul the Apostle says in his epistle to the Romans that the magistrates do not bear the spear without cause; they bear it to punish the wicked and misdoers, and to defend the good men. If you will then take vengeance upon your enemies, you shall have recourse to the judge who has jurisdiction over them; and he shall punish them as the law demands and requires.”

42. “Ah!” said Melibee, “this vengeance pleaseth me not at all. I bethink me now and take heed how Fortune hath nourished me from my childhood and hath helped me to pass many a hard place. Now will I assay her, trusting, with God’s help, that she shall help me to avenge my shame.”

43. “Certainly,” said Prudence, “if ye will work by my counsel, ye shall not assay Fortune in any way; neither shall ye lend or bow unto her. For, as Seneca says: ‘Things done foolishly and in hope of Fortune shall never come to a good end.’ And as the same Seneca says: ‘The more clear and the more shining that Fortune is, the more brittle and the sooner broken she is.’ Trust not in her, for she is neither steadfast nor stable; for when thou deemest thyself most secure of her help, she will fail thee and deceive thee. And whereas you say Fortune hath nourished you from your childhood, I say that thereby the less should you trust in her and in her wit. For Seneca says: ‘He whom Fortune hath nursed, she maketh a great fool.’ Now then, since you desire and ask vengeance, and the vengeance that is done according to law and before the judge liketh you not, and the vengeance done in hope of Fortune is perilous and uncertain, then have you no remedy but to have recourse to the sovereign Judge who avenges all villainies and wrongs; and He shall avenge you after that He Himself witnesseth, where He says: ‘Leave vengeance to me, and I will do it.’”

44. Melibee answered, “If I do not avenge myself for the villainy that men have done to me, I invite and summon those that have done me that villainy and all others to do me another villainy. For it is written: ‘If thou take no vengeance for an old injury, thou invitest thine adversaries to do thee a new evil.’ And also, by my forbearance men would do to me so much villainy that I might neither bear it nor sustain it; and thus should I be put and held in contempt. For men say: ‘In much suffering shall many things befall thee which thou shalt not be able to endure.’”

45. “Certainly,” said Prudence, “I grant you that excessive forbearance is not good; but it does not follow that every person to whom men do a rascaly may take vengeance for it; for that appertains and belongs only to the judges, for they shall avenge villanies and injuries. Therefore those two authorities that you have quoted must be understood of the judges; for when they suffer the wrongs and villanies to be done without punishment, they not only invite new injury and wrong, but they command it. Also a wise man says: ‘The judge who correcteth not the sinner com- mandeth him to sin.’ And the judges and sovereigns might in their land so much suffer the wicked and misdoers that they might, by such sufferance and by process of time, wax so powerful and mighty that they should put out the judges and sovereigns from their places, and at last make them lose their lordships.

46. But now let us suppose that you have leave to avenge yourself. I say you are not now of might and power to avenge you. For if you make comparison to the might of your adversaries, you shall find, in many things, as I have shewn you before, that their condition is better than yours. Therefore I say it is well for you now to suffer and be patient.

47. Furthermore, you know well the common saw: it is madness for a man to strive with one stronger than himself; and to strive with a man of equal strength is perilous; but to strive with a weaker man is folly. Therefore a man should avoid striving as much as he may. For Solomon says: ‘It is a great honour to a man to keep himself from noise and strife.’ And if it so happen that a man of greater might and strength than thou dost do thee an injury, study and busy thyself to still that grievance rather than to avenge thee. For Seneca says: ‘He puts himself in great peril who strives with a greater man than himself.’ And Cato says: ‘If a man of higher estate or degree, or one more mighty than thou, do thee annoyance or grievance, suffer him: for he that once hath grieved thee may another time relieve thee and help.’ Yet I set for a case that you have both might and licence to avenge you. I say there are very many things that should restrain you from vengeance-taking, and make you incline to suffer and to have patience in the things that have been done to you. First and foremost, if you will consider the defects in your own person, for which defects God hath permitted you have this tribulation, as I have said earlier. For the poet says that we ought patiently to take the tribulations that come to us when we think and consider that we have deserved them. And Saint Gregory says that when a man considers well the number of his defects and sins, the pains and tribulations that he suffers will seem the less to him; and inasmuch as he deems his sins heavier and more grievous, in so much his pains will seem lighter and easier to be borne. Also you owe to incline and bow your heart to take the patience of Our Lord Jesus Christ, as Saint Peter says in his epistles: ‘Jesus Christ hath suffered for us, and given example to every man to follow and see Him; for He sinned never, nor ever did a vile word come from His mouth: when men cursed Him, He cursed them not; and when men beat Him, He menaced them not.’ Also the great patience which the saints in Paradise have had in the tribulations they suffered, without their desert or guilt, ought much to stir you to patience. Furthermore, you should force yourself to have patience, considering that worldly tribulations endure but a little while and soon pass away. And the joy that a man seeks by patience in tribulations is enduring, for the apostle says in his epistle: ‘The joy of God is enduring,’ that is, everlasting. Also believe steadfastly that he is not well nurtured nor well taught who cannot have patience or will not receive patience. For Solomon says that ‘the doctrine and the wit of a man is known by patience.’ And elsewhere he says: ‘He that is patient governeth himself with great prudence.’ And Solomon says: ‘The angry and wrathful man makes noises, and the patient man tempers and stills them.’ He says also: ‘It is more worthy to be patient than to be very strong; and he that may have the lordship of his own heart is more to praise than he that by force or strength takes great cities.’ Therefore Saint James says in his epistle that ‘patience is a great virtue of perfection.’

48. “Certainly,” said Melibee, “I grant you, Dame Prudence, that patience is a great virtue of perfection; but not every man may have the perfection that you seek; nor am I of the number of perfectly righteous men, for my heart may never be in peace until it be avenged. And although it was great peril to my enemies to do me a villainy in taking vengeance upon me, yet they took no heed of the peril, but fulfilled their wicked will and courage. Therefore, it seems to me men ought not to reprove me, though I put myself in a little peril to avenge me, and though I do a great excess, that is to say, that I avenge one outrage by another.”

49. “Ah!” said Dame Prudence, “you speak your will and as you please; but in no case of the world should a man do outrage or excess to avenge himself. For Cassiodorus says: ‘He does as ill who avenges himself by outrage as he who does the outrage.’ Therefore you shall avenge yourself after the order of right, that is to say, by the law, and not by excess nor outrage. And also, if you will...



# THE TALE OF MELIBEUS

## Modern English (cleaned)

Venging yourself of the outrage of your adversaries in any manner other than right commandeth is sin; and therefore Seneca says that “a man shall never avenge shrewdness by shrewdness.” And if you say that right requires a man to defend violence by violence, and fighting by fighting, certainly you say sooth.

Christ, as Saint Peter says in his Epistle, “Jesus Christ,” he says, “hath suffered for us, and hath given example to every man to follow Him and to pray unto Him; for He did never sin, nor ever came there a vicious word out of His mouth; when men cursed Him, He cursed them not, and when men belaboured Him with blows, He would not menace them.” Also, the great patience which the saints in Paradise showed in bearing the tribulations of this world, and all without their deserving or their guilt—this ought greatly to prompt you to patience.

Furthermore, you should enforce patience upon yourself when you consider that the tribulations of this world can but a little while endure, being soon over and ended. But the happiness that a man looks to receive by bearing tribulations patiently is perdurable, as the apostle says in his Epistle: “The joy of God,” he says, “is perdurable,” which is to say, it is everlasting.

Also, hold and believe steadfastly that he is neither well bred nor well taught who cannot have patience, or will not receive training in patience. For Solomon says that the belief and the knowledge of a man are known by his patience. And in another place he says that he who is patient will govern himself prudently. And this same Solomon says that the angry and wrathful man is noisy, while the patient man moderates and quiets noise. He says, also, that it is better to be patient than to be very strong; and he that governeth his own heart is more praiseworthy than he that taketh a city. And thereto says Saint James in his Epistle: “Let patience have her perfect work.”

“Surely,” said Melibeus, “I will grant you, Dame Prudence, that patience is a great virtue of perfection; but every man may not attain to the perfection that you seek; nor am I of the number of perfect men, for my heart will never find peace until I have revenged myself. And though it was dangerous to my enemies to do me an injury in taking vengeance upon me, yet took they no heed of their own peril, but fulfilled their evil purpose. And therefore it seems to me that men ought not to find fault with me if I incur a little peril in taking vengeance, even though I go to great excess; that is to say, that I avenge one outrage with another.”

“Ah,” said Dame Prudence, “you speak out of your purpose as you desire it to happen; but never in this world should any man commit an outrage or go to excess to obtain his vengeance. For Cassiodorus says: ‘As much evil does he who avenges himself by outrage as did he who first committed outrage.’ And therefore you must avenge yourself in an orderly manner, and rightfully, that is to say, according to law, and not by excess nor by outrage. For if you avenge yourself in any other way, you sin. And thereupon Seneca says: ‘A man must not avenge villainy with villainy.’

“If you say that right demands that a man defend himself violently against violence, and fightingly against fighting, certainly you speak but the truth when the fighting is done immediately, without interval of tarrying or delay, and simply for defence and not for vengeance. And it behooves a man that he conduct his defence with such moderation that men will have no cause to accuse him of excess and outrage; for otherwise the thing were unreasonable. By God, you know well that you are not now defending yourself, but are going to revenge yourself; and so it follows that you have no wish to do your deed with moderation. That is why I hold that patience would be good for you. For Solomon says: ‘He that is not patient shall endure great harm.’”

“Certainly,” said Melibeus, “I grant you that when a man is impatient and wroth because of that which touches him not, and that in no way concerns him, if he be harmed thereby it is not to be wondered at. For the law provides that he is culpable who interferes or meddles with what does not concern him. And Solomon says that he who interferes in the strife of other men is like one who seizes a hound by the ears. For just as he who takes a strange dog by the ears is likely to be bitten, just so is it reasonable to suppose that he may be injured who, by his impatience, meddles in the strife of other men, when it does not concern him. But you know well that this deed, that is to say, my grief and unrest, touches me closely. Therefore, if I am angry and impatient, it is no marvel. And, saving your presence, I cannot see wherein it can greatly harm me if I wreak my revenge; for I am richer and stronger than are my enemies. And well do you know that with money and great possessions are governed all the matters of this world. Solomon says that all things obey great wealth.”

When Prudence had heard her husband vaunt thus of his possessions and money, despising the power of his enemies, she answered and said: “Surely, dear sir, I grant that you are mighty and rich, and that wealth is a good thing for those who have acquired it honestly and know well how to use it. For just as the body of man cannot live without the soul, neither can it exist without worldly goods. And by means of riches a man may acquire powerful friends.

“Thereupon says Pamphilus: ‘If a cowherd’s daughter be rich, she may make choice of a thousand men which she will take for her husband; for, of a thousand, not one will forsake or refuse her.’ And this Pamphilus also says: ‘If thou be very happy, that is to say, if thou be very rich, thou shall find a great many comrades and friends. And if thy fortune change, so that thou become poor, then farewell fellowship and friendship; for thou shall be left alone, without any company, save it be the company of the poor.’ And still further says Pamphilus: ‘Those who are thralls and born of bondmen’s blood shall be made worthy and noble by wealth.’

“And just as from riches come many good things, so from poverty come many harms and evils. For deep poverty constraineth a man to do many evils. Therefore Cassiodorus calleth poverty ‘the mother of ruin,’ which is to say, the mother of overthrowing or of falling down. And thereupon says Petrus Alfonsus: ‘One of the greatest adversities of this world is when a free man, by kindred or by birth, is constrained by poverty to eat the alms of his enemy.’ And the same thing Innocent says in one of his books: ‘Sorrowful and unhappy is the condition of a poor beggar; for if he beg not his meat, he dieth for hunger; and if he beg, he dieth for shame; and yet necessity constrains him to beg.’ And therefore Solomon says that ‘better it is to die than to have such poverty.’ And this same Solomon says that ‘better it is to die a bitter death than to live in such wise.’

“By these reasons that I have said unto you, and by many other reasons that I could say, I grant you that riches are good to those that get them well, and to those that well use those riches. And therefore will I show you how you shall have yourself, and how you shall bear yourself in gathering riches, and in what manner you shall use them.

“First, you shall get them without great desire, by good leisure and seekingly, and not over hastily. For a man that is too desirous to get riches abandons himself first to theft and to all other evils. And therefore Solomon says: ‘He that hasteth him too busily to wax rich shall be none innocent.’ He says also: ‘The riches that come hastily to a man soon and lightly go and pass from him; but that riches that come little and little wax always and multiply.’

“And, sir, you shall get riches by your wit and by your travail unto your profit; and that without wrong or harm-doing to any other person. For the law says that no man maketh himself rich if he do harm to another person; this is to say, that nature defendeth and forbiddeth by right that no man make himself rich unto the harm of another person. And Tullius says that ‘no sorrow nor no dread of death, nor anything that may befall a man, is so much against nature as for a man to increase his own profit to the harm of another man.’ And though great men and mighty men get riches more lightly than thou, yet shalt thou not be idle nor slow to do thy profit; for thou shalt in all wise flee idleness. For Solomon says that ‘idleness teacheth a man to do many evils.’ And the same Solomon says that ‘he that travailleth and busieth him to till his land shall eat bread; but he that is idle and casteth him to no business nor occupation shall fall into poverty, and die for hunger.’ And he that is idle and slow can never find a convenient time for to do his profit. For there is a versifier who says: ‘The idle man excuseth him in winter because of the great cold, and in summer for the excuse of the heat.’ For these causes Cato says: ‘Wake, and incline not thyself over much to sleep; for over much rest nourishest and causeth many vices.’ And thereupon says Saint Jerome: ‘Do some good deeds, that the devil which is our enemy find you not unoccupied. For the devil taketh not lightly into his working those whom he findeth occupied in good works.’

“Thus then, in getting riches, you must flee idleness. And afterward you shall use the wealth which you have acquired by your wit and by your travail in such manner that men will not hold you to be too scarce, nor too sparing, nor too foolishly generous—that is to say, too great a spendthrift. For just as men blame an avaricious man for his mean-ness and penuriousness, in the same wise is he to be blamed that spendeth too freely. Thereupon Cato says: ‘Use the wealth which thou hast acquired in such manner that men have no reason to call thee either wretch or niggard; for it is shameful for a man to have a poor heart and a rich purse.’ He says also: ‘Use the wealth which thou hast by measure.’ That is to say, spend it within measure; for those who foolishly spend and waste what riches they have, when they have no longer any property of their own, they then scheme to take that of another man.

“I say then that you shall flee avarice; using your riches in such manner that men shall not say that you have buried them, but that you hold them in your power and at your wielding. For a wise man reproveth an avaricious man thus, in two verses: ‘Wherefore and why doth a man bury his wealth, of his great avarice, when he knoweth well that he must needs die; for death is the end of every man in this present life? And for what cause or occasion doth he join or knit himself so closely to his goods that all his wit may not dissever or part him therefrom, when he knoweth, or ought to know, that when he is dead he shall have borne with him nothing at all from this world?’ Thereupon saith Saint Augustine: ‘The avaricious man is like unto hell; for the more it swalloweth the more desire hath it to swallow and devour.’ And just as you would hate to be called an avaricious man, or a stingy, just so should you govern yourself that men will not call you a spendthrift. Therefore says Tullius: ‘The riches of thy house should not be hid, nor should they be kept so closely that they may not be opened by pity and good will.’ That is to say, in order to give a part to those in need. ‘But yet thy wealth should not be so openly exposed as to become the goods of every man.’

“Afterward, in getting your wealth and in using it, you should have always three things in mind, that is to say, Our Lord God, conscience, and your own good name. First, you should have God in your heart, and for the sake of no riches at all should you do anything which may in any manner displease God, Who is your Creator and Maker. For, after the word of Solomon: Better it is to have little and therewith the love of God than great riches and treasure and the loss of God’s love thereby. And the prophet says that it is better to be held for a good man and to have but little of the wealth and treasure of this world, than to be held for a villain and have great riches.

“And yet I say further that you should always do your business in the getting of riches so that you get them with a good conscience. And the apostle says that there is nothing in this world of which we should have so great joy as when our conscience beareth us good witness. And the wise man says that the substance of a man is full good when sin is not in man’s conscience. Afterward, in getting of your riches and in using them you must have great business and great diligence that your good name be always kept and conserved. For Solomon says that ‘better it is and more it availeth a man to have a good name than to have great riches.’ And therefore he saith in another place: ‘Do great diligence in keeping of thy friend and of thy good name; for it shall longer abide with thee than any treasure, be it never so precious.’ And surely he should not be called a gentle man that, after God and good conscience, all things left, doth not his diligence and business to keep his good name. And Cassiodorus says that ‘it is sign of a gentle heart when a man loveth and desireth to have a good name.’ And therefore says Saint Augustine that ‘there be two things that are necessary and needful, and that is good conscience and good name; that is to say, good conscience to thine own person inward, and good name for thy neighbour outward.’ And he that trusteth him so much in his good conscience that he displeseth and setteth at naught his good name or reputation, and recketh not though he keep not his good name, is but a cruel churl.

“Sire, now have I showed you how you shall do in getting riches, and how you shall use them; and I see well that, for the trust that you have in your riches, you will move war and battle. I counsel you that you begin no war in trust of your riches; for they suffice not to maintain wars. And therefore a philosopher says that ‘he that desireth and will alwayes have wars shall never have sufficiency; for the richer that he is, the greater despenses must he make, if he will have worship and victory.’ And Solomon says that ‘the greater riches that a man hath, the more spenders he hath.’ And, dear sire, albeit it be so that for your riches you may have much folk, yet behoveth it not, neither is it good, to begin war where-as you may in other manner have peace unto your worship and profit. For the victories of battles that be in this world lie not in great number or multitude of people nor in the virtue of man; but it lieth in the will and in the hand of Our Lord God almighty.

“And therefore Judas Maccabeus, who was God’s knight, when he should fight against his adversary that had a great number, and a greater multitude of folk and stronger than was the people of Maccabeus, yet he reconforted his little company, and said in this wise: ‘As lightly may our Lord God almighty give victory to few folk as to many folk; for the victories of God are not limited by numbers but by His will.’”

But the happiness that a man looks to receive by bearing tribulations patiently is perdurable, as the apostle says in his Epistle: ‘The joy of God,’ he seith, ‘is perdurable.’ Which is to say, it is everlasting.

Also hold and believe steadfastly that he is neither well bred nor well taught who cannot have patience, or will not receive training in patience. For Solomon seith that the belief and the knowledge of a man are known by his patience. And in another place he seith that he who is patient will govern himself prudently. And this same Solomon seith that the angry and wrathful man is noisy, while the patient man moderates and quiets noise. He seith also that it is better to be patient than to be very strong; and he that governeth his own heart is more praiseworthy than he that taketh a city. And thereto seith Saint James in his Epistle: ‘Let patience have her perfect work.’

“Surely,” quod Melibee, “I graunte yow, Dame Prudence, that patience is a great vertu of perfection; but every man may not attayne to the perfection that ye seek; nor am I of the nombre of perfect men, for my herte shal nevere finde reste till I have revenged me. And though it were dangerous to my enemies to do me that injury in taking vengeance upon me, yet took they none heed of their peril, but fulfilled their evil purpose. And therefore it semeth to me that men ought not to blame me if I incur a little peril in taking vengeance, though I go to great excess; that is to seyn, that I venge one outrage with another.”

“Ah,” quod Dame Prudence, “ye speken after your desire how ye wol that it be; but never in this world should any man commit outrage or go to excess to obtain his vengeance. For Cassiodorus seith: ‘As muche evil doth he that vengeh himself by outrage as did he that first committed outrage.’ And therefore ye must avenge you in an orderly wise and rightfully; that is to seyn, according to the law, and not by excess ne by outrage. For if ye avenge you otherwise, ye sinne. And thereupon Seneca seith: ‘A man must not avenge villainy with villainy.’

‘And if ye seye that right requireth that a man defende him by violence against violence, and by fighting against fighting, certes ye seye sooth, whan the defence is doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tarying or delay, for to defenden him and nat for to vengen him. And it behoveth a man that he put swich attemperance in his defence that men have no cause nor matter to repreve him that defendeth him of excess and outrage; for else were it agayn resoun. Pardee, ye knowen wel that ye maken no defence as now for to defende yow, but for to venge yow; and so sewith it that ye have no wil to do your dede attemprely. And therfore me thinketh that pacience is good. For Salomon seith: that ‘he that is nat pacient shal have great harm.’ ”

49. “Certes,” quod Melibee, “I graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient and wroth of that that toucheth him noght and that aperteneth nat unto him, though it harme him, it is no wonder. For the lawe seith that ‘he is culpable that entremeteth or medleth with such thing as aperteneth nat unto him.’ And Salomon seith that ‘he that entremeteth him of the noyse or stryf of another man is lyk to him that taketh an hound by the eres.’ For right as he that taketh a strange hound by the eres is otherwhile biten with the hound, right in the same wise is it resoun that he have harm that by his inpacience medleth him of the noyse of another man, wheras it aperteneth nat unto him. But ye knowen wel that this dede, that is to seyn, my grief and my disese, toucheth me right ny. And therefore though I be wroth and inpacient, it is no merveille. And, savinge your grace, I can nat seen that it mighte greetly harme me though I toke vengeaunce; for I am richer and more mighty than myne enemys been. And wel knowen ye that by moneye and by great possessions been alle the thinges of this world governed. And Salomon seith that ‘alle thinges obeyen to moneye.’ ”

50. Whan Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten him of his richesse and of his moneye, despreisinge the power of his adversaries, she spak and seide in this wise: “Certes, dere sir, I graunte yow that ye been rich and mighty, and that the richesses ben good to hem that han wel y-geten hem and wel conne usen hem. For right as the body of a man may nat liven withouten the soule, namore may it live withouten temporel goodes. And by richesses may a man gete him grete freendes.

“And therfore seith Pamphilus: ‘If a netherdes doghter,’ seith he, ‘be riche, she may chesen of a thousand men which she wol take to hir housbonde; for of a thousand men oon wol nat forsaken hir ne refusen hir.’ And this Pamphilus seith also: ‘If thou be right happy, that is to seyn, if thou be right riche, thou shalt finde a great nombre of felawes and freendes. And if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre, farewel freendship and felaweshipe; for thou shalt be allone withouten any company, but if it be the company of povre folk.’ And yet seith this Pamphilus moreover that ‘they that been thralle and bonde of lineage shullen be maad worthy and noble by the richesses.’

“And right so as by richesses ther comen many goodes, right so by poverte comen ther many harmes and yvels. For greet poverte constreyneth a man to do many yveles. And therefore clepeth Cassiodore poverte ‘the moder of ruin,’ that is to seyn, the moder of overthrowing or falling down. And therfore seith Petrus Alfonse: ‘One of the gretteste adversitees of this world is whan a free man, by kinde or by burthe, is constreyned by poverte to eten the almesse of his enemy.’ And the same seith Innocent in oon of his bokes: ‘Sorrowful and mishappy is the condition of a povre begger; for if he axe nat his mete he dieth for hunger; and if he axe, he dieth for shame; and algates necessitee constreyneth him to axe.’ And therefore seith Salomon that ‘better it is to dye than for to have swich poverte.’ And as the same Salomon seith: ‘Better it is to dye of bitter deeth than for to liven in swich wise.’

“By these resons that I have seid unto yow, and by manye other resons that I coude seye, I graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel, and to hem that wel usen those richesses. And therefore wol I shewe yow how ye shul have yow, and how ye shul bere yow in gaderinge of richesses, and in what manere ye shul usen hem.

51. First, ye shul geten hem withouten greet desyr, by good leysere seekingly, and nat over hastily. For a man that is to desyringe to gete richesses abandonneth him first to thefte and to alle other yveles. And therefore seith Salomon: ‘He that hasteth him bisily to wexe riche shal be noon innocent.’ He seith also that ‘the richesse that hastily cometh to a man sone and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man; but that richesse that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplyeth.’ And, sir, ye shul geten richesses by your wit and by your travaile unto your profit, and that withouten wrong or harm-doinge to any other persone. For the lawe seith that ‘ther maketh no man himself riche, if he do harm to another wight’; this is to seyn, that nature defendeth and forbidden by right that no man make himself riche unto the harm of another persone. And Tullius seith that ‘no sorwe ne no drede of deeth, ne nothing that may falle unto a man is so muchel agayns nature as a man to encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man.’ And though the grete men and the mighty men geten richesses more lightly than thou, yet shaltou nat be ydel ne slow to do thy profit; for thou shalt in all wise flee idelnesse. For Solomon seith that ‘idelnesse techeth a man to do manye yveles.’ And the same Salomon seith that ‘he that travailleth and bisyeth him to tilien his land shal eten breed; but he that is idel and casteth him to no bisinesse ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte, and dye for hunger.’ And he that is idel and slow can never finde covenable tyme for to doon his profit. For ther is a versifyour that seith that ‘the idel man excuseth him in winter by cause of the grete cold, and in somer by enchesoun of the hete.’ For thise causes seith Caton: ‘Waketh and enclyneth nat yow over muchel for to slepe; for over muchel reste norisseth and causeth many vices.’ And therefore seith seint Jerome: ‘Do some gode dedes, that the devil which is our enemy ne finde yow nat unoccupied. For the devil ne taketh nat lightly into his werkynge swiche as he findeth occupied in gode werkes.’

52. Thanne thus, in geting of richesses, ye mosten flee idelnesse. And afterward ye shul use the richesses which ye have geten by your wit and by your travaille in swich a manere that men holde nat yow to scarce, ne to sparinge, ne to fool-large, that is to seyn over-large a spender. For right as men blamen an avaricious man by cause of his scarcitee and chincherye, in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth over large. And therefore seith Caton: ‘Use thy richesses that thou hast geten in swich a manere that men have no matere ne cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chinche; for it is a greet shame to a man to have a povere herte and a riche purs.’ He seith also: ‘The goodes that thou hast y-geten, use hem by mesure’; that is to seyn, spende hem measurably; for they that foly wasten and despenden the goodes that they han, whan they han no more propre of hir owene, they shapen hem to take the goodes of another man. I seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice; using your richesses in swich a manere that men seye that your richesses been y-buried, but that ye have hem in your might and in your weelding. For a wise man repreveth the avaricious man, and seith thus in two vers: ‘Wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by his grete avarice, and knoweth well that nedes most he dye; for deeth is the ende of every man in this present lyf? And for what cause or encheson joyneth he him or knitteth him so faste unto his goodes that alle his wittes mowen nat disseveren him or departen him from his goodes; and knoweth wel or oghte knowe that whan he is deed he shal no thing bere with him out of this world?’ And therefore seith seint Augustin that ‘the avaricious man is likned unto helle; that the more it swelweth the more desyr it hath to swelwe and devoure.’ And as well as ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chinche, as well sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wise that men calle yow nat fool-large. Therefore seith Tullius: ‘The goodes of thyn hous ne sholde nat been hid, ne kept so clos but that they mighte been opened by pitee and debonairetee’; that is to seyn, to yeven part of hem that han greet nede; ‘ne thy goodes shullen nat been so open, to been every mannes goodes.’

Afterward, in getinge of your richesses and in using of hem, ye shul alwey have three thinges in your herte; that is to seyn, our lord God, conscience, and good name. First, ye shul have God in your herte; and for no richesse ye shul do nothing which may in any manere displese God, that is your Creatour and Maker. For after the word of Salomon: ‘It is better to have a little good with the love of God than to have muchel good and tresour and lese the love of his lord God.’ And the prophete seith that ‘better it is to been a good man and have little good and tresour than to been holden a shrewe and have grete richesses.’ And yet seye I furthermore that ye sholde alwey do your bisinesse to gete yow richesses so that ye gete hem with good conscience. And the apostle seith that ‘ther nis no thing in this world of which we sholden have so greet joye as whan our conscience bereth us good witnessed.’ And the wise man seith that ‘the substance of a man is full good whan sinne is nat in mannes conscience.’

53. Afterward, in getinge of your richesses and in using of hem, ye moste have greet bisinesse and greet diligence that your good name be alwey kept and conserved. For Salomon seith that ‘better it is and more it availeth a man to have a good name than to have grete richesses.’ And therefore he seith in another place: ‘Do greet diligence,’ seith Salomon, ‘in keping of thy freend and of thy good name; for it shall lenger abide with thee than any tresour be it never so precious.’ And certes he sholde nat be called a gentil man that after God and good conscience, alle thinges left, ne dooth his diligence and bisinesse to kepen his good name. And Cassiodore seith that ‘it is signe of a gentil herte whan a man loveth and desireth to han a good name.’ And therefore seith seint Augustin that ‘ther been two thinges that be necessarie and nedeful, and that is good conscience and good loos; that is to seyn, good conscience to thine owene persone inward, and good loos for thy neighbore outward.’ And he that trusteth him so muchel in his good conscience that he displeseth and setteth at naught his good name or loos, and rekketh nought though he kepe nat his good name, is but a cruel cherl.

Sire, now have I shewed yow how ye shul do in getinge richesses and how ye shul use hem; and I see wel that, for the trust that ye han in youre richesses, ye wol move werre and bataille. I conseille yow that ye biginne no werre in trust of your richesses; for they ne suffysen noght werres to maynten. And therefore seith a philosopher that ‘he that desireth and wol alway have werre shal never have suffisaunce; for the richer that he is the greater despenses most he make if he wol have worship and victorie.’ And Salomon seith that ‘the grettier richesses that a man hath the mo despendours he hath.’ And dere sire, albeit it be so that for your richesses ye mowe have muchel folk, yet behoveth it nat nor is it nat good to biginne werre where-as ye mowe in other manere have pees unto your worship and profit. For the victories of batailles that been in this world lye nat in great nombre ne multitude of people nor in the vertu of man; but it lith in the will and in the hand of our lord God almighty.

And therfore Judas Maccabeus, which was Goddes knight, whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversary that hadde a greet nombre and a gretter multitude of folk and stronger than was the peple of Maccabeus, yet he reconforted his litel company and seide right in this wise: “As lightly may our Lord God almighty yeve victorie to a fewe folk as to many folk; for the victoires of God ben nat bounden to nombre but to His wille.”

# THE TALE OF MELIBEUS

If you rest in your wealth you will move toward war and battle. I counsel you that you begin no war upon faith in the continuance of your wealth; for your wealth is not sufficient to maintain war. Wherefore says a philosopher: “He who intrigues for and will always have war, shall never have sufficient funds; for the richer he is, the more must his expenses be, always providing he wants respect and victory.” And Solomon says that the greater a man’s riches the more leeches hang upon him. And, dear sir, though because of your wealth you may have many followers, yet it behooves you not, nor is it a good thing, to initiate a war when you may have a peace, and that to your own honour and profit. For victory in battle in this world lies not in a great multitude of people, neither lies it in the virtue of man; but it lies alone within the will and in the hands of Our Lord God Almighty. And therefore Judas Maccabeus, God’s own knight, when called upon to fight against an adversary greatly superior in numbers and stronger than his own people, comforted his little army, saying:

> “As easily may Our Lord God Almighty give victory unto a few as unto a multitude; for the fortune of war lieth not in numbers, but cometh solely from Our Lord God of Heaven.”

And, dear sir, for as much as there is no man certain whether he be worthy that God give him the victory, any more than he can be certain whether he is worthy of the love of God, therefore Solomon says that every man should greatly fear to begin a war. Also, in battle, many perils befall, and many chances of evil, and therein is a great man as easily slain as a poor; and thereupon is it written in the Second Book of the Kings that the issue of battle is all at chance and is not to be known beforehand; for as easily hurt with a spear is one man as any other. And since there lies great peril in war, therefore should a man flee and eschew warfare, in so far as he may with honour. For Solomon says: “He that liveth by the sword shall perish by the sword.”

After Dame Prudence had spoken in this manner, Melibee answered and said: “I see well, Dame Prudence, that by your fair words and by the reasons you have adduced before me, you are not in favour of war; but I have not yet heard you advise as to what course I ought to pursue in this extremity.”

“Certainly,” quoth she, “I counsel you that you accord with your adversaries, and that you have peace with them. For Saint James says in his Epistle that by concord and peace little fortunes grow great, and by discord and warfare are great fortunes brought low. And well you know that one of the greatest things there is in all this world is unity and peace. Wherefore says Our Lord Jesus Christ in this wise to His disciples: ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.’”

“Ah,” said Melibee, “now do I see well that you love neither my honour nor my reputation. You know well that my adversaries have begun this quarrel and contention by their outrage; and you see well that they neither require nor ask peace from me, nor even do they ask to be reconciled. Will you, then, that I go and show myself meek and make myself humble before them, and cry mercy of them? Forsooth that were not to my honour. For just as men say that too much familiarity breeds contempt, so fares it with overmuch humility or meekness.”

Then began Dame Prudence to make a show of wrath, and she said: “Certainly, sir, saving your grace, I love your honour and your profit as I do my own, and so have I ever; nor have you or any other hitherto said anything to the contrary. And yet, if I had said that you should have bought a peace and a reconciliation, I had not been much mistaken nor said very far amiss. For the wise man says that dissension begins with another, but reconciliation with oneself. And the prophet says: ‘Flee evil and do good; seek peace and follow it.’ Yet say I not that you shall rather sue to your enemies than they to you; for well I know that you are so hard-hearted that you will do nothing for me. And Solomon says that he that is too hard of heart shall in the end have evil fortune.”

When Melibee had heard Dame Prudence make a semblant of wrath, he said in this wise: “Dame, I pray you that you be not displeased at things that I say; for you know well that I am angry and wroth, and that is no wonder; and they that are wroth witen not well what they do, nor what they say. Therefore the prophet says: ‘The troubled eyes have no clear sight.’ But speak and counsel me as you like; for I am ready to do right as you will desire; and if you reprove me of my folly, I am the more bound to love you and to praise you. For Solomon says that he that reproveth him that doth folly shall finde greater grace than he that deceyveth him by sweet wordes.”

Then said Dame Prudence, “I make no semblant of wrath nor anger but for your great profit. For Solomon says: ‘He is more worth that repreveth or chydeth a fool for his folie, shewing him semblant of wrathe, than he that supporteth him and preyseth him in his misdoinge, and laugheth at his folie.’ And this same Solomon saith afterward: that ‘by the sorrowful visage of a man’ — that is to say, by the sorry and heavy countenance of a man — ‘the fool correcteth and amendeth himself.’”

Then said Melibee, “I shall not know how to answer to so many fair reasons as ye putten to me and shew. Sayeth shortly your will and your counsel, and I am all ready to fulfil and perform it.”

Then Dame Prudence discovered all her will to him, and said, “I counsel you, above all things, that ye make peace betwixt God and you; and be reconciled unto Him and to His grace. For as I have said you heretofore, God hath suffered you to have this tribulation and distress for your sins. And if ye do as I say you, God will send your adversaries unto you and make them fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandments. For Solomon saith: ‘When the condition of a man is pleasant and likening to God, He changeth the hertes of the man’s adversaries, and constreineth them to biseeken him of peace and of grace.’ And I pray you, let me speak with your adversaries in private place; for they shall not know that it be of your will or your assent. And then, when I know their will and their intent, I may counsel you the more surely.”

“Dame,” quoth Melibee, “do your will and your liking, for I put me wholly in your disposition and ordinance.”

Then Dame Prudence, when she saw the good will of her husband, delibered and took advice in herself, thinking how she might bring this need unto a good conclusion and to a good end. And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to come unto her into a private place, and shewed wisely unto them the great goods that come of peace, and the great harms and perils that be in war; and said to them in a goodly manner how that they ought to have great repentance of the injury and wrong that they had done to Melibee her lord, and to her, and to her daughter.

And when they heard the gracious words of Dame Prudence they were so taken by surprise and so ravished with delight of her, that it was wonderful to tell. “Ah, lady,” they said, “you have showed us the ‘blessings of sweetness,’ after the saw of David the prophet; for the reconciliation which we are in no way worthy to have — though we ought, by greater contrition and humility, to ask it — you, of your goodness, have offered to us. Now see we well that the wisdom and knowledge of Solomon are true indeed, for he says that sweet words multiply and increase friends and cause villains to become courteous and humble.

“Certainly,” said they, “we will put our deeds and all our matter and cause wholly in your good keeping; and we stand ready to obey the word and command of Lord Melibee. Therefore, dear and benign lady, we pray and beseech you, as humbly as we can, that it shall please you, in your great goodness, to fulfill your goodly words in deeds; for we consider and acknowledge that we have offended and grieved Lord Melibee beyond measure, so far indeed that it lies not within our power to make him any amends. Therefore we obligate and bind ourselves and our friends to do whatsoever he commands. But perchance he has for us such heaviness of wrath, because of our offence, that he will impose upon us so great a pain of punishment that we shall not be able to bear it. And therefore, noble lady, we beseech you, of your womanly pity, to take such advisement in this need that we, and our friends, shall not be disinherited and destroyed because of our folly.”

“Certainly,” said Prudence, “it is a hard thing, and a dangerous thing, for a man to put himself utterly into the arbitrament and judgment and into the might and power of his enemies. For Solomon says: ‘Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another, lest it repent thee, and thou entreat for the same again. As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any.’ Now, since he counsels that a man give not even to a brother or a friend the power over his body, by a stronger reason he forbids a man to give himself over to his enemy. Nevertheless, I counsel you that you mistrust not my lord. For I know well and truly that he is kindly and meek, large-hearted, courteous, and nothing desirous nor covetous of goods and riches. For there is nothing in all the world that he desires, save only respect and honour. Furthermore, I know well and am right sure that he will do nothing in this case without my counsel. And I shall so work therein that, by the grace of Our Lord God, you shall be reconciled unto us.”

Then they said with one voice: “Worshipful lady, we put ourselves and our property all fully at your command and disposal; and we are ready to come, upon whatever day is agreeable to your goodness, to make and give our obligation and bond, that as strong as your goodness may desire, all that we may fulfill your will and that of Lord Melibee.”

When Dame Prudence had heard the answers of these men, she bade them go away again privily; and she returned to her lord Melibee, and told him how she found his adversaries full repentant, acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespass, and how they were ready to suffer all pain, requiring and praying him of mercy and pity.

Then said Melibee, “He is well worthy to have pardon and forgiveness of his sin that excuses not his sin, but acknowledgeth it and repenteth him, asking indulgence. For Seneca says: ‘There is the remission and forgiveness where confession is’; for confession is neighbour to innocence. And he saith in another place: ‘He that hath shame for his sin and acknowledgeth it is worthy remission.’ And therefore I assent and confirm me to have peace; but it is good that we do it not without the assent and will of our friends.”

Then was Prudence right glad and joyful, and said, “Certes, sir, ye have well and goodly answered. For right as by the counsel, assent, and help of your friends ye have been stirred to avenge you and make war, right so without their counsel shall ye not accord you nor have peace with your adversaries. For the law says: ‘There is nothing so good by way of kind, as a thing to be unbound by him that it was bound.’”

And then Dame Prudence, without delay or tarrying, sent anon her messengers for her kin, and for her old friends which were true and wise, and told them by order, in the presence of Melibee, all this matter as it is above expressed and declared; and prayed them that they would give their advice and counsel what were best to do in this need. And when Melibee’s friends had taken their advice and deliberation of the aforesaid matter, and had examined it by great business and great diligence, they gave full counsel to have peace and rest; and that Melibee should receive with good heart his adversaries to forgiveness and mercy.

And when Dame Prudence had heard the assent of her lord Melibee, and the counsel of his friends, accordant with her will and her intention, she was wondrously glad in her heart, and said: “There is an old proverb which saith: ‘The goodness that thou mayst do this day, do it; and abide not nor delay it till tomorrow.’ Therefore I counsel that ye send your messengers, such as be discrete and wise, unto your adversaries; telling them, on your behalf, that if they will treat of peace and accord, that they shape them without delay or tarrying to come unto us.” Which thing was done. And when these trespassers and repentant folk of their folies, that is to say, the adversaries of Melibee, had heard what these messengers said unto them, they were right glad and joyful, and answered full meekly and benignly, yielding graces and giving thanks to Lord Melibee and to all his party; and they made ready, without delay, to accompany the messengers in obedience to the command of Lord Melibee.

Soon they took their way toward Melibee’s court, and took with them some of their true friends to stand as sureties for them, and as hostages. And when they came into the presence of Melibee, he spoke to them as follows: “It stands thus, and true it is, that ye, without just cause, and without right or reason, have done great injury and wrong to me, to my wife Prudence, and to my daughter also. For ye have entered my house with violence, and ye did such outrage here that all men know well enough that ye have fully deserved death; therefore do I ask of you whether ye will leave the punishment, the chastisement, and the vengeance of this thing to me and to my wife Prudence? Or will ye not?”

Then the wisest of these three answered for them all, saying: “Sir, we know well that we are unworthy to come into the court of so great and so worthy a lord as you are. For we have so greatly erred, and have offended guiltily in such wise against your lordship, that verily we have deserved death. But yet, for the great goodness and kindness that all the world witnesses in your person, we submit ourselves to the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship, and stand ready to obey all your commands, beseeching you, that of your mercy and pity you will consider our great repentance and humble submission, and will grant us forgiveness for our outrageous trespass and offence. For well we know that your liberal grace and mercy reach out farther into goodness than our outrageous guilts and trespasses into wickedness; and this despite the fact that we have wickedly and damnably offended against your high lordship.”

Then Melibee took them benignly up from the ground, and received their obligations and bonds, by their oaths, and their pledges and sureties and hostages, and assigned a day for their reappearance.

54. After that Dame Prudence hadde spoken in this manere, Melibee answerde and seyde, “I see wel, dame Prudence, that by your faire wordes and by your resouns that ye han shewed me, that the werre lyketh yow no-thing; but I have nat yet herd your conseil, how I shal do in this nede.”

55. “Certes,” quod she, “I conseille yow that ye accorde with youre adversaries, and that ye have pees with hem. For Seint Jame seith in his Epistles that ‘by concord and pees the smale richesses waxen grete, and by debaat and discord the grete richesses fallen doun.’ And ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste and most sovereyn thing that is in this world is unitee and pees. And therfore seyde our Lord Jesu Crist to his apostles in this wise: ‘Wel happy and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees; for they been called children of God.’”

“A! quod Melibee, “now see I wel that ye loven nat myn honour ne my worshipe. Ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han bigonnen this debaat and brige by hir outrage; and ye seeth wel that they ne requeren ne preyen me nat of pees, ne they asken nat to be reconsiled. Wol ye thanne that I go and meke me and obeye me to hem, and crye hem mercy? For sothe, that were nat my worship. For right as men seyn, that ‘over-greet homlinesse engendreth dispreysinge,’ so fareth it by to greet humilitee or mekenesse.”

56. Thanne bigan Dame Prudence to maken semblant of wratthe, and seyde, “Certes, sir, sauf your grace, I love your honour and your profit as I do myn owene, and ever have doon; ne ye ne noon other sye never the contrarie. And yit, if I hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees and the reconsiliacioun, I ne hadde nat muchel mistaken me, ne seyd amis. For the wyse man seith: ‘The dissensioun bigynneth by another man, and the reconsiling bigynneth by thy-self.’ And the prophete seith: ‘Flee shrewednesse and do goodnesse; seke pees and folwe it, as muchel as in thee is.’ Yet seye I nat that ye shul rather pursue to your adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow; for I knowe wel that ye been so hard-herted, that ye wol do nothing for me. And Salomon seith: ‘He that hath over-hard an herte, at the laste he shal mishappe and mistyde.’”

57. Whanne Melibee hadde herd Dame Prudence maken semblant of wratthe, he seide in this wise, “Dame, I prey yow that ye be nat displesed of thinges that I seye; for ye knowe wel that I am angry and wrooth, and that is no wonder; and they that been wrothe witen nat wel what they doon, ne what they seyn. Therfore the prophete seith: ‘Troubled eyen han no cleer sighte.’ But seyeth and counselth me as yow lyketh; for I am redy to do right as ye wol desire; and if ye repreve me of my folye, I am the more holden to love yow and to preyse yow. For Salomon seith: ‘He that repreveth him that doth folye, he shal finde gretter grace than he that deceyveth him by swete wordes.’”

58. Thanne seide Dame Prudence, “I make no semblant of wratthe ne anger but for your grete profit. For Salomon seith: ‘He is more worth that reprevveth or chydeth a fool for his folye, shewinge him semblant of wratthe, than he that supporteth him and preyseth him in his misdoinge, and laugheth at his folye.’ And this same Salomon seith afterward: that ‘by the sorweful visage of a man’ — that is to seyn, by the sory and hevy countenaunce of a man — ‘the fool correcteth and amendeth himself.’”

59. Thanne seide Melibee, “I shal nat conne answere to so manye faire resouns as ye putten to me and shewen. Seyeth shortly your wil and your conseil, and I am al redy to fulfille and parfome it.”

60. Thanne Dame Prudence discovered al hir wil to him, and seyde, “I conseille yow, above alle thinges, that ye make pees bitwene God and yow; and beth reconsiled unto Him and to His grace. For as I have seyde yow heerbiforn, God hath suffred yow to have this tribulacioun and this disese for your sinnes. And if ye do as I sey yow, God wol sende your adversaries unto yow, and maken hem fallen at your feet, redy to do your wil and your comandements. For Salomon seith: ‘Whan the condicion of man is plesant and likinge to God, He chaungeth the hertes of the mannes adversaries, and constreyneth hem to biseeken him of pees and of grace.’ And I prey yow, lat me speke with your adversaries in privee place; for they shul nat knowe that it be of your wil or your assent. And thanne, whan I knowe hir wil and hir entente, I may conseille yow the more surely.”

61. “Dame,” quod Melibee, “dooth your wil and your likinge, for I putte me hoolly in your disposicioun and ordinaunce.”

62. Thanne Dame Prudence, whan she saugh the gode wil of her housbonde, delibered and took avys in hir-self, thinkinge how she mighte bringe this nede unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende. And whan she saugh hir tyme, she sente for these adversaries to come unto hir into a privee place, and shewed wysely unto hem the grete goodes that comen of pees, and the grete harmes and perils that been in werre; and seyde to hem in a goodly maner how that they oughte have greet repentaunce of the injurie and wrong that they hadden doon to Melibee hir lord, and to hir, and to hir doughter.

63. And whan they herden the goodliche wordes of Dame Prudence, they weren so surprised and ravisshed, and hadden so greet joye of hir, that wondir was to telle. “A! lady!” quod they, “ye han shewed unto us ‘the blessinge of swetnesse,’ after the saw of David the prophete; for the reconsilinge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere, but we oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humilitee, ye of your grete goodnesse have presented unto us. Now see we wel that the science and the conninge of Salomon is ful trewe; for he seith that ‘swete wordes multiplyen and encrecen freendes, and maken shrewes to be debonaire and meke.’”

64. “Certes,” quod they, “we putten our dede and al our matere and cause al hoolly in your goode wil; and been redy to obeye to the speche and comandement of my lord Melibee. And therfore, dere and benigne lady, we preyen yow and biseken yow as mekely as we conne and mowen, that it lyke unto your grete goodnesse to fulfillen in dede your goodliche wordes; for we consideren and knowe that we han offended and greved my lord Melibee out of mesure; so ferforth, that we ben nat of power to maken his amendes. And therfore we oblige and binden us and our freendes to doon al his wil and his comandements. But peraventure he hath swich hevinesse and swich wratthe toward us, by cause of our offence, that he wol enioyne us swich a peyne as we mowe nat here nor sustene. And therfore, noble lady, we biseken to your wommanly pitee to taken swich avisement in this nede, that we ne our freendes be nat desherited ne destroyed through our folye.”

65. “Certes,” quod Prudence, “it is an hard thing and right perilous, that a man putte al ourely in the arbitracioun and juggeement, and in the might and power of his enemys. For Salomon seith: ‘Leve thou me, and yeve credence to that I schal seyn; I seye,’ quod he, ‘ye peple, folk, and governours of holy chirche, to thy sone, to thy wyf, to thy freend, ne to thy brother ne yeve thou never might ne maistrie of thy body while thou livest.’ Now sithen he defendeth that man shal nat yeven to his brother ne to his freend the might of his body, by a strenger resoun he defendeth and forbiddeth a man to yeven him-self to his enemy. And nathelees I conseille you that ye mistruste nat my lord. For I woot wel and knowe verraily that he is debonaire and meke, large, curteys, and nothing desirous ne coveitous of good ne richesse. For ther nis no-thing in this world that he desireth, save only worship and honour. Furthermore I knowe wel and am right seer that he shal no-thing doon in this nede withouten my conseil. And I shal so werken in this cause that, by the grace of our Lord God, ye shul be reconciled unto us.”

66. Thanne seyden they with o vois, “Worshipful lady, we putten us and our goodes al fully in your wil and disposicioun; and been redy to comen what day that it lyke unto your noblesse to limite us or assigne us, to maken our obligacioun and bond as strong as your goodnesse may desire, that we mowe fulfille the wille of yow and of my lord Melibee.”

67. Whan Dame Prudence hadde herd the answeres of these men, she bad hem goon agayn privily; and she retourned to hir lord Melibee, and tolde him how she found his adversaries ful repentant, knowlechinge ful lowely hir sinnes and trespas, and how they were redy to suffren al peyne, requiringe and preying him of mercy and pitee.

68. Thanne seyde Melibee, “He is wel worthy to have pardoun and foryivenessse of his sinne, that excuseth nat his sinne, but knowlecheth it and repenteth him, axinge indulgence. For Seneca seith: ‘Ther is the remissioun and foryifnesse wheras confessioun is’; for confessioun is neighbore to innocence. And he seith in another place: ‘He that hath shame for his sinne and knowlecheth it, is worthy remissioun.’ And therfore I assente and conferme me to have pees; but it is good that we do it nat withouten the assent and wil of our freendes.”

69. Thanne was Prudence right glad and joyful, and seyde, “Certes, sir, ye han wel and goodly answered. For right as by the conseil, assent, and help of your freendes ye han been stirred to venge you and maken werre, right so withouten hir conseil shul ye nat accorde you nor have pees with your adversaries. For the lawe seith: ‘Ther nis no-thing so good by wey of kinde as a thing to been unbounde by him that it was y-bounde.’”

70. And thanne Dame Prudence, withouten delay or taryinge, sente anon hir messagers for hir kin, and for hir olde freendes which that were trewe and wise, and tolde hem by ordre, in the presence of Melibee, al this matere as it is aboven expressed and declared; and preyden hem that they wolde yeven hir avys and conseil what best were to doon in this nede. And whan Melibee’s freendes hadde taken hir avys and deliberacioun of the forsaid matere, and hadden examined it by greet bisinesse and greet diligence, they yaf ful conseil for to have pees and reste; and that Melibee sholde receyve with good herte his adversaries to foryifnesse and mercy.

71. And whan Dame Prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord Melibee, and the conseil of his freendes, accordant with hir wille and hir entencioun, she was wonderly glad in hir herte, and seyde: “Ther is an old proverbe which seith that ‘the goodnesse that thou mayst do this day do it, and abide nat nor delay it til to-morwe.’ And therefore I conseille that ye sende your messages, swiche as been discrete and wise, unto your adversaries; tellinge hem, on your bihalf, that if they wole trete of pees and of accord, that they shape hem withouten delay or tarying to comen unto us.”

Which thing was performed in dede. And when these trespassours and repentant folk of their folies, that is to seyn the adversaries of Melibee, hadden herd what these messagers seiden unto them, they weren right glad and joyeful, and answere­den ful mekely and benigne, yeldinge graces and thankes to Lord Melibee and to all his partie; and they made redy, withouten delay, to come and to be at his court at the day appointed.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

before his court to receive and accept his sentence and judgment, which he should impose; and after this, each man returned to his own home.

And when Dame Prudence saw her opportunity, she asked her lord, Melibee, what vengeance he proposed taking on these adversaries.

To which Melibee replied: “Surely I think and fully purpose to confiscate all that they have and to strip them out of their inheritances, and then to send them into perpetual banishment.”

“Certainly,” said Dame Prudence, “that were a cruel sentence and much against reason. For you are rich enough, and have no need of other men’s property. And you could easily in this way acquire a name for covetousness, which is a vicious thing and ought to be avoided by every good man. For, after the word of the apostle, covetousness is the root of all evil.

[§§72–78 — Middle English]

And with the messengers men camen to hir lord Melibee and to al his company; and shapen hem, withouten delay, to go with the messagers, and obeye to the commandement of hir lord Melibee.

72. And right anon they tok her wey to the court of Melibee, and tok with hem some of her trewe freendes, to maken feith for hem and for to been hir borwes. And whan they were comen to the presence of Melibee, he seyde hem these wordes: “It standeth thus,” quod Melibee, “and sooth it is, that ye, causeless, and withouten skile and resoun, han doon grete injuries and wronges to me and to my wif Prudence, and to my doghter also. For ye han entred into myn hous by violence, and have doon swich outrage, that alle men knowen wel that ye have deserved the deeth; and therfore wol I knowe and wite of yow, whether ye wol putte the punissement and the chastisinge and the vengeance of this outrage in the wil of me and of my wif Prudence; or ye wol nat?”

73. Thanne the wyseste of hem thre answerde for hem alle, and seyde: “Sire,” quod he, “we knowen wel, that we been unworthy to comen unto the court of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been. For we han so greedy mistaken us, and han offended and agilt in swich a wise agayn your heigh lordshipe, that trewely we han deserved the deeth. But yet, for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that all the world witnesseth of your persone, we submitten us to the excellence and benignitee of your gracious lordshipe, and been redy to obeye to alle your comandements; bisekinge yow, that of your merciable pitee ye wol considere our grete repentaunce and lowe submissioun, and graunten us foryevenesse of our outrageous trespas and offence. For wel we knowe, that your liberal grace and mercy strecchen hem ferther into goodnesse, than doon our outrageouse giltes and trespas into wikkednesse; al-be-it that cursedly and dampnably we han agilt agayn your heigh lordshipe.”

74. Thanne Melibee tok hem up fro the ground full benignely, and receyved hir obligaciouns and hir bondes by hir othes upon hir plegges and borwes, and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne unto his court, for to accepte and receive the sentence and jugement that Melibee wolde comaunde to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd; whiche thinges ordeyned, every man retoumed to his hous.

75. And whan that dame Prudence saugh hir tyme, she freyned and axed hir lord Melibee, what vengeance he thoughte to taken of hise adversaries?

76. To which Melibee answerde and seyde, “Certes,” quod he, “I thinke and purpose me fully to desherite hem of al that ever they han, and for to putte hem in exil for ever.”

77. “Certes,” quod dame Prudence, “this were a cruel sentence, and muche a-gayn resoun. For ye been riche ynough, and han no nede of other mennes good; and ye mighte lightly in this wise gete yow a covetous name, which is a vicious thing, and oghte been eschewed of every good man. For after the saw of the word of the apostle: ‘Convoitise is

rote of alle harmes.’ And therfore, it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of your owene, than for to taken of hir good in this manere. For bettre it is to lesen good with worship, than it is to winne good with vileinye and shame. And every man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisinesse to geten him a good name. And yet shal he nat only bisie him in kepinge of his good name, but he shal also enforcen him alwey to do som-thing by which he may renovele his good name; for it is writen, that ‘the olde good loos or good name of a man is sone goon and passed, whan it is nat newed ne renovelled.’ And as touchinge that ye seyn, ye wol exile your adversaries, that thinketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure, considered the power that they han yeven yow upon hem-self. And it is writen, that ‘he is worthy to lesen his privilege that misuseth the might and the power that is yeven him.’ And I sette cas ye mighte enjoyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe, which I trowe ye mowe nat do, I seye, ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun per-aventure, and thanne were it likly to retourne to the werre as it was bifore. And therfore, if ye wol that men do yow obeisance, ye moste demen more curteisly; this is to seyn, ye moste yeven more esy sentences and jugements. For it is writen, that ‘he that most curteisly comaundeth, to him men most obeyen.’ And therfore, I prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede, ye caste yow to overcome your herte. For Seneca seith: ‘He that overcometh his herte, overcometh twyes.’ And Tullius seith: ‘Ther is no-thing so comendable in a greet lord as whan he is debonaire and meke, and appeseth him lightly.’ And I prey yow that ye wol forbere now to do vengeance, in swich a manere, that your goode name may be kept and conserved; and that men mowe have cause and matere to pleyen yow of pitee and of mercy; and that ye have no cause to repente yow of thing that ye doon. For Seneca seith: ‘He overcometh in an yvel manere, that repenteth him of his victorie.’ Wherfore I pray yow, lat mercy been in your minde and in your herte, to the effect and entente that God almighty have mercy on yow in his laste jugement. For seint Jame seith in his epistle: ‘Jugement withouten mercy shal be doon to him, that hath no mercy of another wight.’”

78. Whanne Melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of dame Prudence, and hir wise informaciouns and techinges, his herte gan enclyne to the wil of his wif, consideringe hir trewe entente; and conformed him anon, and assented fully to werken after hir conseil; and thonked God, of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse, that him sente a wif of so greet discrecioun. And whan the day cam that hise adversaries sholde apperen in his presence, he spak unto hem ful goodly, and seyde in this wise: “Al be it so that of your pryde and presumpeioun and folie, and of your necligence and unconninge, ye have misborn yow and trespassed unto me; yet, for as much as I see and biholde your grete humilitee, and that ye been sory and repentant of your giltes, it constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy. Therefore I receive yow to my grace, and foryeve yow outrely alle the offences, injuries, and wronges, that ye have doon agayn me and myne; to this effect and to this end, that God of his endeles mercy wol at the tyme of our dying foryeven us our giltes that we han trespassed to him in this wrecched world. For douteles, if we be sory and repentant of the sinnes and giltes which we han trespassed in the sight of our lord God, he is so fresshe and so merciable, that he wol foryeven us our giltes, and bringen us to his blisse that never hath ende. Amen.”

## THE MONK'S PROLOGUE

### The Merry Words of the Host (modern English rendering)

When ended was my tale of Melibee  
And of Prudence and her benignity,

Our host remarked: “As I am a faithful man,  
And by the precious corpus Madrian,  
I’d rather have her than a barrel of good ale  
That my wife Goodlief could have heard this tale!

For she has no such patience, I’ll avow,  
As had this Melibee’s Prudence, now.

By God’s own bones! When I do beat my knaves  
She fetches forth the stoutest gnarly staves  
And cries aloud: ‘Slay the damned dogs, every one!  
And break their bones, backbone and every bone!’  
And if but any neighbour, aye, of mine  
Will not, in church, bow to her and incline,  
Or happens to usurp her cherished place,  
Why, she comes home and ramps right in my face,  
Crying, ‘False coward, go avenge your wife!  
By corpus bones! Come, let me have your knife,  
And you shall take my distaff and go spin!’

From day to day like this will she begin:  
‘Alas!’ she cries, ‘that ever fate should shape  
My marriage with a milksop coward ape  
That may be overborne by every wight!  
You dare not stand up for your own wife’s right!’  
This is my life, unless I choose to fight;  
And through the door anon I must take flight.  
Or else I’m lost, unless, indeed, that I  
Be like a young wild lion, foolhardy.  
I know well she will make me kill, one day,  
Some neighbour man and have to run away.  
For I am dangerous with a knife in hand,  
Albeit that I dare not her withstand;  
For she’s big of arm, and wickedly inclined,  
As anyone who crosses her will find.  
But let us leave that doleful subject here.

‘My lord the Monk,’ said he, ‘be of good cheer;  
For you shall tell a tale, and verily.’”

### The Host to the Monk (Middle English, cleaned)

Whan ended was my tale of Melibee,  
And of Prudence and hir benignitee,  
Our hoste seyde, “as I am a faithful man,  
And by the precious corpus Madrian,  
I hadde lever than a barel ale  
That goode lief my wif hadde herd this tale!

For she nis no-thing of swich pacience  
As was this Melibeus wif Prudence.

By goddes bones! whan I bete my knaves,  
She bringth me forth the grete clobbed staves,  
And cryeth, ‘Slee the dogges everichoon,  
And brek hem, bothe bak and every boon.’  
And if that any neighbur of myne  
Wol nat in chirche to my wif enclyne,  
Or be so hardy to hir to trespace,  
Whan she comth hoom, she rampeth in my face,  
And cryeth, ‘False coward, wreek thy wif!  
By corpus bones! I wol have thy knyf.  
And thou shalt have my distaf and go spinne!’  
Fro day to nacht right thus she wol beginne;  
‘Allas!’ she seith, ‘that ever I was shape  
To wedde a milksop or a coward ape,  
That wol be overlad with every wight!  
Thou darst nat stonden by thy wifes right!’  
This is my lyf, but-if that I wol fighte;  
And out at dore anon I moot me dighte.  
Or elles I am but lost, but-if that I  
Be lyk a wilde leoun fool-hardy.  
I woot wel she wol do me slee som day  
Som neighbur, and thanne go my wey.  
For I am perilous with knyf in honde,  
Al be it that I dar nat hir withstonde,  
For she is big in armes, by my feith,  
That shal he finde, that hir misdooth or seith.  
But lat us passe awey fro this mater.

“My lord the Monk,” quod he, “be mery of chere;  
For ye shul telle a tale trewely.”

Lo! Rouchestre stant heer faste by!  
Ryd forth, myn owene lord, brek nat our game,  
But, by my trouthe, I knowe nat your name,  
Wher shal I calle yow my lord dan John,  
Or dan Thomas, or elles dan Albon?  
Of what hous be ye, by your fader kin?  
I vow to God, thou hast a ful fair skin.  
It is a gentil pasture ther thou goost;  
Thou art nat lyk a penaunt or a goost.  
Upon my feith, thou art som officer,  
Som worthy sexteyn, or som celerer,  
For by my fader soule, as to my doom,  
Thou art a maister whan thou art at hoom;  
No povre cloisterer, ne no novys,  
But a governour, wily and wys.  
And therwithal of brawnes and of bones  
A wel-faring persone for the nones.

I pray to God, yeve him confusioun  
That first thee broghte unto religioun;  
Thou woldest han been a trede-foul aright.  
Haddestow as greet a leve, as thou hast might  
To parfourn al thy lust in engendrure,  
Thou haddest bigeten many a creature.

Alas! why werestow so wyd a cope?  
God yeve me sorwe! but, and I were a pope,  
Not only thou, but every mighty man,  
Though he were shorn ful hye upon his pan,  
Sholde have a wif; for al the world is lorn!  
Religioun hath take up al the corn  
Of treding, and we borel men ben shrimpes!  
Of feble trees ther comen wrecched impes.  
This maketh that our heires been so sclendre  
And feble, that they may nat wel engendre.  
This maketh that our wyves wol assay  
Religious folk, for ye may bettre paye  
Of Venus payements than mowe we;  
God woot, no lussheburghes payen ye!  
But be nat wrooth, my lord, for that I pleye;  
Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye.”

This worthy monk took al in pacience,  
And seyde, “I wol doon al my diligence,  
As fer as souneth into honestee,  
To telle yow a tale, or two or three.  
And if yow list to herkne hiderward,  
I wol yow seyn the lyf of seint Edward;  
Or elles first Tragedies wol I telle  
Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle.  
Tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie,  
As olde bokes maken us memorie,  
Of him that stood in greet prosperitee  
And is yfallen out of heigh degree  
Into miserie, and endeth wrecchedly.  
And they ben versifyed comunly  
Of six feet, which men clepe hexameter.  
In prose eek been endited many oon,  
And eek in metre, in many a sondry wyse.  
Lo! this declaring oghte ynough suffise.  
Now herkneth, if yow lyketh for to here;  
But first I yow biseke in this matere,  
Though I by ordre telle nat thise thinges,  
Be it of popes, emperours, or kinges,  
Each in his place, as men in writings finde.  
But I put some before and some bihinde,  
As they to memory may come by chance;  
Hold me excused, pray, of my ignoraunce.”

## THE MONK'S TALE

### Here beginneth the Monk’s Tale of the Falls of Famous Men (modern English rendering)

I will bewaile in manner of tragedy  
The ills of those that stood in high degree  
And fell so far there was no remedy  
To bring them out of their adversity;

For certain ’tis, when Fortune wills to flee,  
There may no man the course of her withhold;  
Let no man trust in blind prosperity;  
Be warned by these examples true and old.

With Lucifer, though he was an angel fair  
And not a man, with him will I begin;  
For though Fortune may not an angel dare,  
From high degree yet fell he for his sin  
Down into Hell, and he lies yet therein.

O Lucifer, brightest of angels all,  
Now art thou Satan, and thou may’st not win  
From misery wherein thou forth didst fall!

Lo, Adam, in the garden Damascene,  
By God Almighty’s finger wrought was he,  
And not begotten of man’s sperm unclean;  
He ruled all Paradise, except one tree.  
Had never earthly man so high degree  
As Adam, till he, for misgovernance,  
Was driven from his high prosperity  
To labour, and to Hell, and to mischance.

Lo, Samson, whose birth was annunciated  
By an angel long ere his nativity,  
And was to God Almighty consecrated,  
And had nobility while he could see.  
Was never such another as was he  
For bodily strength, and therein hardiness;  
But to his wives he told his privity,  
Whereby he slew himself for wretchedness.

Samson, this noble mighty champion,  
Without a weapon in his hands, I say,  
He slew and rent in two a young lion,  
While to his wedding walking in the way.  
His false wife could so please him, she did pray  
Till she his secret held; when she, untrue,  
Unto his foes that secret did betray  
And him forsook for other loves and new.

### Samson (Middle English, cleaned)

Lo Samson, which that was annunciat  
By th’angel, longe er his nativitee,  
And was to God Almighty consecrat,  
And stood in noblesse, whyl he mighte see.  
Was never swich another as was he,  
To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardinesse;  
But to his wyves tolde he his secree,  
Through which he slow himself, for wrechednesse.

Three hundred foxes Samson tok for ire,  
And alle hir tayles he togider bond,  
And sette the foxes’ tayles alle on fire,  
For he on every tayl had knit a brond;  
And they brende alle the cornes in that lond,  
And alle hir oliveres and vynes eek.  
A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,  
And hadde no wepen but an asses cheek.

Whan they were slayn, so thursted him that he  
Was wel ny lorn, for which he gan to preye  
That God wolde on his peyne han som pitee,  
And sende him drinke, or elles moste he deye;  
And of this asses cheek, that was dreye,  
Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle,  
Of which he drank ynogh, shortly to seye;  
Thus helped him God, as Judges can telle.

By verray force, at Gazan, on a night,  
Maugre Philistiens of that cité,  
The gates of the town he hath up-plight,  
And on his bak ycaried hem hath he  
Hye on an hille, that men mighte hem see.

O noble almighty Samson, lief and dere,  
Had thou nat told to women thy secree,  
In al this worlde ne hadde been thy pere!  
This Samson never sikeer drank ne wyn,  
Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne shere.  
By precept of the messager divyn,  
Bore alle his strengthes in his heres were,  
And fully twenty winter, yeer by yeer,  
He hadde of Israel the governaunce.

But sone shal he wepe many a tere,  
For women shal him bringen to meschaunce.  
Unto his lemman Dalida he tolde  
That in his heres al his strengthe lay,  
And falsly to his fo-men she him solde.  
And sleeping in hir barme upon a day  
She made to clippe or shere his heer away.  
And made his fo-men al his craft espyen;  
And whan that they him fonde in this array,  
They bounden him faste, and putten out his eyen.

But er his heer were clipped or yshave,  
Ther was no bond with which men might him binde;  
But now is he in prisoun in a cave,  
Wher-as they made him at the querne grinde.

O noble Samson, strongest of mankind,  
O whilom juge in glorie and in richesse,  
Now maystow wepe with thin eyen blinde,  
Sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse.

The ende of this caytif was as I shal seye;  
His fo-men made a feste upon a day,  
And made him as hir fool bifore hem pleye,  
And this was in a temple of greet array.

# THE MONK’S TALE

Nets of gold thread he had in great plenty  
To fish in Tiber when he pleased to play.

His lusts were all the laws in his decree,  
For Fortune was his friend and would obey.

He burned Rome for his delicate profligacy;  
Some senators he slew upon a day  
Only to learn how men might weep and cry;  
He killed his brother and with his sister lay.

His mother put he into piteous way,  
For he her belly ripped up just to see  
Where he had been conceived; alack-a-day,  
That but so little for her life cared he!

No tear out of his two eyes for that sight came,  
But he said: “A woman fair was she.”

Great wonder is it how he could or might  
Pass judgment thus upon her dead beauty.

Wine to be brought him then commanded he,  
And drank anon; no other sign he made.

When might is wedded unto cruelty,  
Alas, too deep its venom will pervade!

A master had in youth, this emperor,  
To teach him letters and all courtesy;

For of morality he was the flower.  
In his own time, unless the old books lie;

And while this master held his mastery,  
So well he taught him wiles and subtle ways

That ere could tempt him vice or tyranny  
Was, it is said, the length of many days.

This Seneca, of whom I do apprise,  
By reason Nero held him in such dread,

Since he for vices spared not to chastise, —  
Discreetly, though, by word and not by deed —

“Sir,” would he say, “an emperor must need  
Be virtuous and hate all tyranny” —

For which, in bath, did Nero make him bleed  
From both his arms until he had to die.

This Nero had, though, out of arrogance,  
Been wont, in youth, against the rod to rise,

Which afterward he thought a great grievance;  
Wherefore he made him perish in this wise.

Nevertheless, this Seneca the wise  
Chose in a bath to die, as you did hear,

Rather than suffer in some other guise;  
And thus did Nero slay his master dear.

Now it befell that Fortune cared no longer  
To Nero’s high pride to be accomplice;

For though he might be strong, yet she was stronger;  
She thought thus: “By God, I am none too nice,

Setting a man who is but filled with vice  
In high degree, emperor over all.

By God, up from his seat I will him trice;  
When he least thinks of it, then shall he fall.”

The people rose against him, on a night,  
For all his faults; and when he it espied,

Out of the doors he went and took to flight alone;  
And where he thought he was allied he knocked;

But always, and the more he cried,  
The faster did they bar the doors, aye all;

Then learned he well he’d been his own worst guide,  
And went his way, nor longer dared to call.

The people cried and rumbled up and down;  
And, having ears, he heard the thing they said:

“Where’s this false tyrant Nero, where’s he flown?”  
For fear almost out of his wits he strayed,

And to his gods, then, piously he prayed  
For succour, but no help might him betide.

For fear of this he wished himself unmade,  
And ran into a garden, there to hide.

And in this garden were two fellows, yea,  
Who sat before a great fire and a red,

And to those fellows he began to pray  
That they would slay him and strike off his head,

But of his body, after he was dead,  
They should do nothing to its further shame.

Himself he slew; no better counsel sped,  
Whereat Dame Fortune laughed and made a game.

## HOLOFERNES

Was never captain under a king  
That reigned more, put in subjection,  
Nor stronger was in field of all things,  
As in his time, nor greater of renown,  
Nor more pompous in high presumption  
Than Holofernes, whom Fortune aye kissed,  
So lecherously, and led him up and down  
Till that his head was off ere that he wist.

Not only that this world had him in awe  
For levy of riches or liberty,  
But he made every man renounce his law.  
“Nebuchadnezzar was God,” said he,  
“No other god should be adored by me.”

Against his hest no wight dared trespass  
Save in Bethulia, a strong city,  
Where Eliachim a priest was of that place.

But take keep of the death of Holofernes:  
Amid his host he drunkly lay one night,  
Within his tent, large as is ever a barn;  
And yet, for all his pomp and all his might,  
Judith, a woman, as he lay upright,  
Sleeping, smote off his head, and from his tent  
Full privily she stole from every wight,  
And with his head unto her town she went.

## KING ANTIOCHUS

What needs it, as for King Antiochus,  
To tell his high and royal majesty,  
His high pride, his works so venomous?  
For such another was there never be.

Read what that is said of him in Maccabee,  
And read the proud words that he said,  
And why he fell from high prosperity,  
And on a hill how wretchedly he lay dead.

Fortune had him so enhanced in pride  
That verily he thought he might attain  
Unto the stars on every side,  
And in a balance weigh each mountain,  
And all the floods of the sea restrain.

And God’s people had he most in hate;  
Them would he slay in torment and in pain,  
Weening that God might not his pride abate.

And for that Nicanor and Timothy  
Of Jews were vanquished mightily,  
Unto the Jews such a hate had he  
That he bade make his chariot full hastily,  
And swore, and said, full despiteously,  
That unto Jerusalem he would straight go,  
To wreak his ire on it full cruelly;  
But of his purpose he was stayed so soon.

God, for his menace, smote him so sore  
With invisible wound, aye incurable,  
That in his guttes it carved so and more  
That his pains were insupportable.

And certainly the thing was reasonable,  
For many a man’s guts he had caused pain;  
But from his purpose, cursed, damnable,  
In spite of all he would not him restrain.

He bade anon apparellen all his host,  
And suddenly, ere he of it was ware,  
God daunted all his pride and all his boast.

For he so sore fell out of his chariot  
That from his very bones the flesh did tear,  
So that he might not either walk or ride,  
But in a litter men were forced to bear  
Him with them, bruised upon the back and side.

The wrath of God smote him so cruelly  
That through his body loathsome maggots crept;  
And therewithal he stank so horribly  
That none of those that round his person kept,  
Whether he lay awake or whether slept,  
Could, for the very stench of him, endure.

In this foul state he wailed and howled and wept;  
That God was Lord of all he then was sure.

To all his host and to himself also  
Full loathsome was his carrion, one great blain;  
There were no men could bear him to and fro.  
And in this stink and in this horrid pain  
He died full wretchedly on a mountain.

Thus had this robber and this homicide,  
Who made so many men weep and complain,  
Such guerdon as belongs to too great pride.

## OF ALEXANDER

Alexander’s tale is so well known a tune  
That everyone who is not simple grown  
Has heard somewhat, or all, of his fortune.

This whole wide world, to state and conclusion known,  
He won by strength, or else for his renown;  
Right gladly men to sue for peace did send.

The pride of man and beast he tumbled down  
Where’er he went, and that was the world’s end.

Comparison might never yet be staked  
Upon a single similar conquering power;  
For all this world in dread of him has quaked.

He was of knighthood and of freedom’s flower;  
Fortune made him her heir to honour’s bower:  
Save wine and women, nothing might assuage  
His high intent in arms; all men must cower,

So filled he was of leonine courage.

What praise were it to him, though ’gainst were told  
Darius’ tale or of others brought low —  
Of kings and dukes and earls and princes bold,  
The which he conquered and brought down to woe?

I say, as far as man may ride or go  
The world was his, to tell it in a trice.

For though I wrote or told you always so,  
Of his knighthood the time would not suffice.

Twelve years he reigned, as tells us Maccabee;  
And Philip’s son of Macedon he was,  
Who first was king of Greece, the whole country.

O noble Alexander, O alas!  
That ever you should come to such a pass!

For poisoned by your very own you were;  
Your six did Fortune turn into an ace.  
And yet for you she never wept a tear!

Who shall me give tears to complain  
The death of gentleness and of franchise,  
That all the world wielded in his demesne,  
And yet him thought it might not suffice?

So full was his courage of high enterprise.  
Alas! who shall me help to endite  
False Fortune, and poison to despise,  
The which two of all this woe I wite?

> The storie of Alisaundre is so comune,  
> That every wight that hath discrecioun  
> Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.

> This wyde world, as in conclusioun,

## JULIUS CAESAR

By wisdom, manhood, and by great labour  
From humble bed to royal majesty  
Up rose he, Julius the conqueror,

That won the Occident by land and sea,  
By strength of hand, or else by treaty,  
And unto Rome made them tributaries;  
And then of Rome the emperor was he,

Till that Fortune waxed his adversary.

O mighty Caesar, that in Thessaly  
Against Pompeius, father thine in law,  
That of the Orient had all the chivalry  
As far as that the day beginneth daw,  
Thou through thy knighthood hast them take and slay,  
Save few folk that with Pompeius fled;  
Through which thou puttest all the Orient in awe.  
Thank Fortune, that so well thee sped!

But now a little while I will bewail  
This Pompeius, this noble governor  
Of Rome, which fled at this battle;  
I say, one of his men, a false traitor,

His head he smote off, to win him favour  
Of Julius, and him the head he brought.

Alas, Pompey, of the Orient conqueror,  
That Fortune unto such an end thee brought!

To Rome again repaired Julius  
With his triumph, laureate full high;  
But on a time Brutus and Cassius,  
That ever had of his high estate envy,

Full privily had made conspiracy  
Against this Julius, in subtle wise,  
And cast the place in which he should die  
With daggers, as I shall you devise.

This Julius to the Capitol went  
Upon a day, as he was wont to goon.

And in the Capitol anon they seized him,  
This false Brutus, and his other foes,  
And stucked him with daggers anoon  
With many a wound, and thus they let him lie;  
But never groaned he, save at one stroke,  
(Or two perchance), unless his legend lie.

So manly was this Julius in his heart,  
And so well loved he stately decency,  
That, though his deadly wounds did burn and smart,  
His mantle yet about his hips cast he,  
That no man there should see his privity.

And as he lay there, dying, in a trance,  
And knew that he was dying, verily,  
Of decency yet had he remembrance.

Lucan to tell this story I commend,  
Suetonius too, Valerius also,  
Who of the tale have written to the end  
And told how, of these mighty conquerors two,  
Fortune was first the friend and then the foe.

No man may trust in Fortune’s favour long,  
But as one fearing ambush must he go.  
Witness the end of all these conquerors strong.

The wealthy Croesus, Lydia’s sometime king,  
Of which Croesus King Cyrus had such dread,  
Yet was he taken, in his pride swelling,  
And to be burned upon a pyre was led.

But such a rain down from the clouds was shed  
As quenched the fire and let him there escape;  
But to be warned, no grace was in him spread  
Till Fortune on the gallows made him gape.

When he’d escaped, not changed was his intent  
To march at once into new wars again.  
He thought right well ’twas Fortune that had sent  
Such chance that he’d escape because of rain,  
And that by foes he never should be slain;

And then a vision in the night he met,  
At which he waxed so proud and grew so fain  
That upon vengeance all his heart was set.

Upon a tree he was, or so he thought,  
Where Jupiter did wash him, back and side,  
And Phoebus, then, a fair white towel brought  
To dry him with and thereby swell his pride;

And to his daughter, who stood there beside,  
And well, he knew, in knowledge did abound,  
He bade interpret what it signified,  
And she his dream in this wise did expound.

“The tree,” she said, “the gallows is to mean,  
And Jupiter betokens snow and rain,  
While Phoebus with his towel white and clean,  
That is the sunbeams beating down amain;

You shall be hanged, O father, ’tis certain;  
The rain shall wash you and the sun shall dry.”  
And thus she gave him warning flat and plain,  
His daughter, who was Phania, say I.

So hanged was Croesus, that proud Lydian king;  
His royal throne could nothing then avail.  
Tragedy is no other kind of thing:

> So manly was this Julius at herte  
> And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,

## CROESUS

This rich Croesus, whilom king of Lydia,  
Of whom Croesus Cyrus sore him dreaded,  
Yet was he caught amid his pride and pride,  
And to be burnt men to the fire him led.

But such a rain down from the welkin shed  
That slow the fire, and made him to escape;  
But to be warned no grace yet he had,  
Till Fortune on the gallows made him gape.

Nor can the singer cry nor bewail,  
But that Dame Fortune always will assail  
With unwarned stroke the reigns that be proud;  
For when men trust her, then will she fail,  
And cover her bright face with a cloud.

## OF KING PEDRO OF SPAIN

O noble, O worthy Pedro, glory of Spain,  
Whom Fortune held so high in majesty,  
Well ought men read thy piteous death with pain!

Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee;  
And after, at a siege, by subtlety,  
Thou wert betrayed, and led unto his tent,  
Where he with his own hand smote thee and slewed,  
Succeeding in thy realm and in thy rent.

The field of snow, with eagle black therein,  
Caught with the lime-rod, coloured as the gleed,  
He brewed this cursedness and all this sin.

The “Wicked Nest” was worker of this deed;  
Not Charles Oliver, that aye took heed  
Of truth and honour, but the Armorican,  
Ganelon Oliver, corrupt for meed,  
Brought this worthy king into such a brike.

And out of joy bring men to sudden sorrow.

## OF BERNABO (OF LOMBARDY)

Of Milan, great Bernabo Visconti,  
God of delight, and scourge of Lombardy,  
Why should I not recount thy miseries,  
Since in estate thou climbedst were so high?

# COUNT OF PISA

Of Ugolino, Count of Pisa's woe  
No tongue can tell the half for hot pity.

Near Pisa stands a tower, and it was so  
That to be there imprisoned doomed was he,  
While with him were his little children three;  
The eldest child was scarce five years of age.  
Alas, Fortune! It was great cruelty  
To lock such birds up in such a cage!

Damned was he to die in that prison,  
For Roger, who was bishop of Pisa,  
Had on him made a false suggestion,  
Through which the people rose against him,

Condemned was he to die in that prison,  
Since Ruggieri, Pisa’s bishop, twice  
Had lied, intrigued, and egged old passions on.  
Whereby the people did against him rise,

And thrust him into prison in such wise  
As you have heard: and meat and drink he had  
So small that it could not long suffice,  
And was, moreover, very poor and bad.

And on a day befell it, at the hour  
When commonly to him his food was brought,  
The gaoler shut the great doors of the tower.  
He heard it well enough, but he said naught.

And to his heart anon there came the thought  
That they by hunger would leave him to die.  
"Alas," said he, "that ever I was wrought!"  
And thereupon the tears fell from his eye.

His youngest son, who three years was of age,  
Unto him said: "Father, why do you weep?  
When will the gaoler bring us our pottage?  
Is there no crumb of bread that you did keep?

I am so hungry that I cannot sleep.  
Now would God that I might sleep on for aye!  
Then should not hunger through my belly creep;  
For nothing more than bread I'd rather pray."

Thus, day by day, this little child did cry,  
Till on his father's breast at length he lay  
And said, "Farewell, my father, I must die."  
And kissed the man and died that very day.

And when the father saw it dead, I say,  
For grief his arms he gnawed until blood came,  
And said: "Alas, Fortune! and weylaway,  
It is thy treacherous wheel that I must blame!"

His children thought that it for hunger was;  
They cried: "O father, do not thus, alas!  
But rather eat our young flesh, even so;  
This flesh you gave us; take it back and go  
And eat enough!" 'Twas thus those children cried,  
And after that, within a day or two,  
They laid themselves upon his knees and died.

Himself, despairing, all by hunger starved;  
Thus ended this great count of Pisa's cries;  
All his vast riches Fortune from him carved.  
Of his fate tragic let thus much suffice.

Whoso would hear it told in longer wise,  
Let him read the great bard of Italy  
Whom men call Dante; seen through Dante's eyes  
No point is slurred, nor in one word fails he.

The arms of Bertrand du Guesclin.

Chaucer puts this for "of Mauny," not meaning thereby Sir Oliver Mauny.

---

And on a day befell that, in that hour,  
When that his meat wont was to be brought,  
The jailer shut the doors of the tower.  
He heard it well — but he spake right naught,

And in his heart anon there fell a thought,  
That they for hunger would do him die.  
“Allas!” quod he, “alas! that I was wrought!”  
Therewith the tears alen from his eyen.

His young son, that three years was of age,  
Unto him said, “Fader, why do ye weep?  
When will the jailer bring our potage?  
Is there no morsel of bread that ye do keep?

I am so hungry that I may not sleep.  
Now wold God that I might sleep forever!  
Then should not hunger in my womb creep;  
There is no thing, save bread, that me were lever.”

Thus day by day this child began to cry.  
Till in his father's barm adown it lay,  
And said, “Farwel, father, I must die,”  
And kissed his father, and died the same day.

And when the woeful father did it see,  
For woe his arms two he gan to bite,  
And said, “Alas, Fortune! and weylaway!  
Thy false wheel my woe all may I rede!”

His children wende that it for hunger was  
That he his arms gnow, and not for woe,  
And said, “Father, do not so, alas!  
But rather eat the flesh upon us two;

Our flesh thou gavest us, take our flesh from us  
And eat enough”: right thus they to him said,  
And after that, within a day or two,  
They laid them in his lap adown, and died.

Himself, despairing, eke for hunger starved;  
Thus ended in this mighty Earl of Pisa;  
From high estate Fortune away him carved.  
Of this Tragedy it ought enough suffice.

Who so will hear it in a longer wise,  
Readeth the great poet of Italy,  
That hight Dante, for he can all devise  
From point to point; not one word will he fail.

# THE PROLOGUE OF THE NUN'S PRIEST'S TALE

"Ho!" quod the knight, "good sir, namore of this,  
That ye han said is right ynough, ywis,  
And much more; for little heaviness  
Is right ynough to much folk, I gess.

I seye for me, it is a great disease  
Whereas men han been in great wealth and ease.  
To heren of her sudden fall, alas!  
And the contrary is joy and great solas.

As whan a man hath been in poor estate  
And climbeth up, and waxeth fortunate,  
And there abideth in prosperity,  
Such thing is gladsome, as it thinketh me.

And of such thing were goodly for to telle."

"Ye," quod our hoste, "by Saint Paul's bell.  
Ye seye right sooth; this monk, he clappeth loud.  
He spak how 'fortune covered with a clowd'  
I know never what, and also of a 'Tragedie'  
Right now ye heard, and, pardee, no remedie;  
It is to bewail, neither to complaine  
That that is done, and also it is a peine.

As ye han seyde, to here of heaviness.  
Sir monk, namore of this, so God you blesse!  
Your tale anoyeth all this company;  
Such talking is not worth a butterfly;

For therein is ther no desport ne game.  
Wherefor, Sir Monk, or Don Piers by your name,  
I preye you heartily, tell us somewhat else.  
For, sikely, nere clinking of your bells

That on your bridle hang on every side,  
By heaven king, that for us all died,  
I should ere this have fallen down for sleep,  
Although the slough had never been so deep;

Then had your tale all been told in vain.  
For certain, as that these clerks seyn,  
'Where as a man may have none audience,  
Naught helpeth it to tellen his sentence.'

And well I wot the substance is in me  
If any thing shall well reported be.  
Sir, say somewhat of hunting, I you preye."

"Nay," quod this monk, "I have no lust to play;  
Now let another telle, as I have told."

Than spak our host, with rude speech and bold,  
And seyde unto the Nun's Preest anon,  
"Com neer, thou preest, com hider, thou Sir John,  
Tell us such thing as may our hearts glade.

Be blithe, though thou ride upon a jade.  
What though thy horse be both foul and lean,  
If he will serve thee, rekke not a bean;  
Look that thy heart be merry evermo."

"Yis, sir," quod he, "yis, host, so mote I go.  
But if I be merry, ywis, I will be blamed": —

"Yes, sir," said he, "yes, host, so may I go,  
For, save I be merry, y-wis, I will be blamed."

And right away his story has he framed,  
And thus he said unto us ev'ry one,  
This dainty priest, this goodly man, Sir John.

# THE NUN'S PRIEST'S TALE

## Of the Cock and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote

A widow poor, somewhat advanced in age,  
Lived, on a time, within a small cottage  
Beside a grove and standing down a dale.  
This widow, now, of whom I tell my tale,

Since that same day when she'd been last a wife,  
Had led, with patience, her strait simple life,  
For she'd small goods and little income-rent;  
By husbanding of such as God had sent

She kept herself and her young daughters twain.  
Three large sows had she, and no more, 'tis plain,  
Three cows and a lone sheep that she called Moll.  
Right sooty was her bedroom and her hall,

Wherein she'd eaten many a slender meal.  
Of sharp sauce, why she needed no great deal,  
For dainty morsel never passed her throat;  
Her diet well accorded with her coat.

Repletion never made this woman sick;  
A temperate diet was her whole physic,  
And exercise, and her heart's sustenance.  
The gout it hindered her no whit to dance,

Nor apoplexy spun within her head;  
And no wine drank she, either white or red;  
Her board was mostly garnished, white and black,  
With milk and brown bread, whereof she'd no lack,

Broiled bacon and sometimes an egg or two,  
For a small dairy business did she do.  
A yard she had, enclosed all round about  
With pales, and there was a dry ditch without,

And in the yard a cock called Chauntecleer.  
In all the land, for crowing, he had no peer.  
His voice was merrier than the organ gay  
On Mass days, which in church begins to play;

More regular was his crowing in his lodge  
Than is a clock or abbey horologe.  
By instinct he'd marked each ascension down  
Of equinoctial value in that town;

For when fifteen degrees had been ascended,  
Then crew he so it might not be amended.  
His comb was redder than a fine coral,  
And battlemented like a castle wall.

His bill was black and just like jet it shone;  
Like azure were his legs and toes, each one;  
His spurs were whiter than the lily flower;  
And plumage of the burnished gold his dower.

This noble cock had in his governance  
Seven hens to give him pride and all pleasance,  
Which were his sisters and his paramours,  
And wondrously like him as to colours,

Whereof the fairest hued upon her throat  
Was called the winsome Mistress Pertelote.

A povre widwe, somdel stape in age,  
Was whylom dwelling in a narwe cotage,  
Biside a grove, stonding in a dale.  
This widwe, of which I telle you my tale,

Sin thilke day that she was last a wyf,  
In pacience ladde a ful simple lyf,  
For litel was hir catel and hir rente;  
By housbondrye, of such as God hir sente,

She fond hir-self, and eke hir doghtren two.  
Three large sowes hadde she, and namo,  
Three kyn, and eke a sheep that highte Malle,  
Ful sooty was hir bour, and eke hir halle,

In which she eet ful many a sclendre meel.  
Of poynaunt sauce hir neded never a deel.  
No deyntee morsel passed thurgh hir throte;  
Hir dyete was accordant to hir cote.

Repleccioun ne made hir never syk;  
Attempree dyete was al hir phisyk,  
And exercyse, and hertes sufhsaunce.  
The goute lette hir no-thing for to daunce,

N'apoplexye shente nat hir heed;  
No wyn ne drank she, neither whit ne reed;  
Hir bord was served most with whit and blak,  
Milk and broun breed, in which she fond no lak,

Seyd bacoun, and somtyme an ey or tweye,  
For she was as it were a maner deye.  
A yerd she hadde, enclosed al about  
With stikkes, and a drye dich without,

In which she hadde a cok, hight Chauntecleer,  
In al the land of crowing nas his peer.  
His vois was merier than the mery orgon  
On messe-dayes that in the chirche gon;

We more sekerer was his crowing in his logge,  
Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge.  
By nature knew he ech ascencioun  
Of equinoxial in thilke toun;

For whan degrees fiftene were ascended,  
Thanne crew he, that it mighte nat ben amended.  
His comb was redder than the fyn coral,  
And batailed, as it were a castel-wal.

His bile was blak, and as the jeet it shoon;  
Lyk asur were his legges, and his toon;  
His nayles whytter than the lilie flour,  
And lyk the burned gold was his colour.

This gentil cok hadde in his governaunce  
Sevene hennes, for to doon al his plesaunce,  
Whiche were his sustres and his paramours,  
And wonder lyk to him, as of colours.

Of whiche the faireste hewed on hir throte  
Was cleped faire damoysele Pertclote.

---

Courteous she was, discreet, and debonnaire,  
And compaignable, and she had been so fair  
Since that same day when she was seven night old,  
That truly she had Chanticleer's heart in hold;

He loved her so, that well was him therewith.  
But such a joy was it to hear them sing,  
When that the bright sun began to spring,  
In sweet accord, "My lief is faren in londe."

For that time, as I have understood,  
Beasts and birds could speak and sing aloud.  
And so befell, that in a dawning bright,  
As Chauntecleer among his wives all

Sat on his perch, that was in the hall,  
And next him sat this faire Pertelote,  
This Chauntecleer began to groan in his throat,  
As man that in his dream is dreded sore.

And when that Pertelote thus heard him roar,  
She was aghast, and said, "O herte dere,  
What aileth you to groan in this manere?  
Ye been a verray sleper; fie for shame!"

And he answered and said thus, "Madame,  
I pray you that ye take it not a-grief:  
By God, me mette I was in such meschief  
Right now, that yet my heart is sore afright.

Now God," quod he, "my sweven recche aright,  
And keep my body out of foul prison!  
Me mette how that I romed up and down  
Within our yerd, wher-as I saw a beast,

Was like an hound, and would have made arrest  
Upon my body, and would have had me dead.  
His colour was betwix yellow and red;  
And tipped was his tail, and both his ears

With black, unlike the remnant of his hairs;  
His snout small, with glowing eyen tweye.  
Yet of his look for fear almost I dye;  
This caused me my groaning, doubteless."

"Avoy!" quod she, "fie on you, hertelees!  
Allas!" quod she, "for by that God above,  
Now han ye lost my heart and all my love;  
I can not love a coward, by my feith.

For certes, what so any woman saith,  
We alle desire, if it might be,  
To han husbands hardy, wise, and free,  
And secree, and no niggard, ne no fool,

Ne him that is aghast of every tool,  
Ne noon avauntour, by that God above!  
How dorste ye seyn, for shame, unto your love,  
That any thing might make you afeard?

Have ye no man's heart, and han a beard?  
Allas! and conné ye been aghast of swevenis?  
No-thing, God wot, but vanity, in sweven is.  
Swevens engendren of replecciouns,

And oft of fume, and of complecciouns,  
When humours been too habundant in a wight.  
Certes this dreme, which ye han met tonight,  
Cometh of the great superfluity

Of your red choler, pardee,  
Which causeth folk to dreaden in her dreams  
Of arrows, and of fire with red lemes,  
Of great beasts, that they will them bite,

Of conteke, and of whelpes great and lite;  
Just as the humour of melancholy  
Causes full many a man, in sleep, to crye,  
For fear of black bears, or of bulls all black,

Or lest black devils put them in a sack.  
Of other humours could I tell also,  
That worken many a man in sleep full woe;  
But I will pass as lightly as I can.

"Lo, Cato, which was such a full wise man,  
Said he not, we shall trouble not for dreams?  
Now, sir," quod she, "when we fly from the beams,  
For God's love, go and take some laxative;

On peril of my soul, and as I live,  
I counsel you the best, I will not lie,  
That both for choler and for melancholy  
You purge yourself; and since you should not tarry,

And on this farm there's no apothecary,  
I will myself go find some herbs for you  
That will be good for health and for your view;  
And in our own yard all these herbs I'll find,

The which have properties of proper kind  
To purge you underneath and up above.  
Forget this not, now, for God's very love!  
You are so very choleric of complexion.

Beware the mounting sun and all dejection,  
Nor get yourself with sudden humours hot;  
For if you do, I dare well lay a groat  
That you shall have the tertian fever's pain,

Or some ague that may well be your bane.  
A day or two you shall have digestives  
Of worms before you take your laxatives  
Of laurel, centaury, and fumitory,

Or else of hellebore purgatory,  
Or caper spurge, or else of dogwood berry,  
Or herb ivy, all in our yard so merry;  
Pick them just as they grow and gulp them in.

Be merry, husband, for your father's kin!  
Dread no more dreams. And I can say no more."

"Madam," said he, "gramercy for your lore.  
Nevertheless, not running Cato down,

Who had for wisdom such a high renown,  
And though he says to hold no dreams in dread,  
By God, men have, in many old books, read  
Of many a man more an authority

That ever Cato was, pray pardon me,  
Who say the very reverse of his sentence,  
And have found out by long experience  
That dreams indeed are good significations,

As much of joys as of all tribulations  
That folk endure here in this life present.  
There is no need to make an argument;  
The very proof of this is shown indeed.

"One of the greatest authors that men read  
Says thus: That once two comrades went  
On pilgrimage, and all in good intent;

And it so chanced they came into a town  
Where there was such a crowding up and down  
Of people, and so little harbourage,  
That they found not so much as one cottage

Wherein the two of them might sheltered be.  
Wherefore they must, as of necessity,  
As for that night, depart company;  
And each of them goes to his hostelry,

And took his lodging as it would fall.  
That one of them was lodged in a stall,  
Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough;  
That other man was lodged well enough,

As was his adventure, or his fortune,  
That us governeth all as in commune.  
"And so befell, that long ere it were day,  
This man met in his bed, there as he lay,

How that his fellow gan upon him call,  
And said, 'Alas! for in an ox's stall  
This night I shall be murdered where I lie.  
Now help me, dear brother, ere I die;

In all haste come to me,' he said.  
This man out of his sleep for fear awaked;  
But when that he was waked of his sleep,  
He turned him, and took of this no keep;

He thought his dream was but a vanity.  
Thus twice in his sleeping dreamed he.  
And at the third time yet his fellow  
Came, as him thought, and said, 'I am now slain;

Behold my bloody wounds, deep and wide!  
Arise up early in the morrow-tide,  
And at the west gate of the town,' quod he,  
'A cart full of dung there shalt thou see,

In which my body is hid full privily;  
Do that cart arresteth boldly.  
My gold caused my murder, sooth to say';  
And told him every point how he was slain,

With a full pitous face, pale of hue.  
And trust well, his dream he found full true;  
For on the morrow, as soon as it was day,  
To his fellows he took the way;

And when that he came to this ox's stall,  
After his fellow he began to call.  
The hostler answered him anon,  
And said, 'Sire, your fellow is agon,

As soon as day he went out of the town.'  
This man began to fall in suspicion,  
Remembering the dreams that he had met,  
And forth he goes—no longer would he let

Unto the west gate of the town, and found  
A dung-cart, as it were to dung the ground,  
That was arrayed in the same wise  
As ye have heard the dead man devise;

And with an hardy heart he gan to cry  
Vengeance and justice of this felony:—

'My fellow murdered is this same night,  
And in this cart he lieth gaping upright.  
I cry out on the ministers,' quod he,

'That should keep and rule this city;  
Harrow! alas! here lieth my fellow slain!'  
What should I more unto this tale say?  
The people out-sprang, and cast the cart to ground,

And in the middle of the dung they found  
The dead man, that murdered was all new.  
O blissful God, that art so just and true!  
Lo how that thou discoverest murder alway!

Murder will out, that see we day by day.

For that one night at least, part company;

# PRIEST’S TALE

And each went to a different hostelry  
And took such lodgment as to him did fall.

Now one of them was lodged within a stall,  
Far in a yard, with oxen of the plow;  
That other man found shelter fair enow,  
As was his luck, or was his good fortune.  
Whatever ’tis that governs us, each one.

“So it befell that, long ere it was day,  
This last man dreamed in bed, as there he lay,  
That his poor fellow did unto him call,  
Saying: ‘Alas! For in an ox’s stall  
This night shall I be murdered where I lie.  
Now help me, brother dear, before I die.  
Come in all haste to me.’ ’Twas thus he said.

This man woke out of sleep, then, all afraid;  
But when he’d wakened fully from his sleep,  
He turned upon his pillow, yawning deep,  
Thinking his dream was but a fantasy.  
And then again, while sleeping, thus dreamed he.  
And then a third time came a voice that said  
(Or so he thought): ‘Now, comrade, I am dead;  
Behold my bloody wounds, so wide and deep!  
Early arise tomorrow from your sleep,  
And at the west gate of the town,’ said he,  
A wagon full of dung there shall you see,  
Wherein is hid my body craftily;  
Do you arrest this wagon right boldly.  
They killed me for what money they could gain.  
And told in every point how he’d been slain,  
With a most pitiful face and pale of hue.

And trust me well, this dream did all come true;  
For on the morrow, soon as it was day,  
Unto his comrade’s inn he took the way;  
And when he’d come into that ox’s stall,  
Upon his fellow he began to call.  
The keeper of the place replied anon,  
And said he: ‘Sir, your friend is up and gone;  
As soon as day broke he went out of town.’

This man, then, felt suspicion in him grown,  
Remembering the dream that he had had,  
And forth he went, no longer tarrying, sad,  
Unto the west gate of the town, and found  
A dung-cart on its way to dumping-ground,  
And it was just the same in every wise  
As you have heard the dead man advertise;  
And with a hardy heart he then did cry  
Vengeance and justice on this felony:

‘My comrade has been murdered in the night,  
And in this very cart lies, face upright.  
I cry to all the officers,’ said he,  
‘That ought to keep the peace in this city.  
Alas, alas, here lies my comrade slain!’

Why should I longer with this tale detain?  
The people rose and turned the cart to ground,  
And in the center of the dung they found  
The dead man, lately murdered in his sleep.

“O Blessed God, Who art so true and deep!  
Lo, how Thou dost turn murder out alway!  
Murder will out, we see it every day.

Murder’s so hateful and abominable  
To God, Who is so just and reasonable,  
That He’ll not suffer that it hidden be;  
Though it may skulk a year, or two, or three.  
Murder will out, and I conclude thereon.

Immediately the rulers of that town  
Took the carter, and so sore they racked  
Him and the host, until their bones were cracked,  
That they confessed their wickedness anon;  
And hanged they both were by the neck, and soon.

“Here may men see that dreams are things to dread.  
And certainly, in that same book I read,  
Right in the very chapter after this  
(I spoof not, as I may have joy and bliss),  
Of two men who would voyage o’er the sea.  
For some cause, and unto a far country,  
If but the winds had not been all contrary,  
Causing them both within a town to tarry,  
Which town was builded near the haven-side.

But then, one day, along toward eventide,  
The wind did change and blow as suited best.  
Jolly and glad they went unto their rest,  
And were prepared right early for to sail;  
But unto one was told a marvelous tale.  
For one of them, a-sleeping as he lay,  
Did dream a wondrous dream ere it was day,  
He thought a strange man stood by his bedside  
And did command him, he should there abide,  
And said to him: ‘If you tomorrow wend,  
You shall be drowned; my tale is at an end.’

He woke and told his fellow what he’d met  
And prayed him quit the voyage and forget;  
For just one day he prayed him there to bide.  
His comrade, who was lying there beside,  
Began to laugh and scorned him long and fast.  
‘No dream,’ said he, ‘may make my heart aghast,  
So that I’ll quit my business for such things.  
I do not care a straw for your dreamings,  
For visions are but fantasies and japes.  
Men dream, why, every day, of owls and apes,  
And many a wild phantasm therewithal;  
Men dream of what has never been, nor shall.

But since I see that you will here abide,  
And thus forgo this fair wind and this tide,  
God knows I’m sorry; nevertheless, good day!’

And thus he took his leave and went his way.  
But long before the half his course he’d sailed,  
I know not why, nor what it was that failed,  
But casually the vessel’s bottom rent,  
And ship and men under the water went,  
In sight of other ships were there beside,  
Which had sailed with that same wind and tide.

“And therefore, pretty Pertelote, my dear,  
By such old-time examples may you hear  
And learn that no man should be too reckless  
Of dreams, for I can tell you, fair mistress,  
That many a dream is something well to dread.

“Why in the *Life* of Saint Kenelm I read  
(Who was Kenelphus’ son, the noble king  
Of Mercia), how Kenelm dreamed a thing;

A little ere he was murdered, on a day  
He saw his own death in a vision, so men say.  
His nurse interpreted, as records tell,  
That vision, bidding him to guard him well  
From treason; but he was but seven years old,  
And therefore little tale had he been told  
Of any dream — so holy was his heart.

By God, I’d rather than retain my shirt  
That you had read his legend, as have I.  
Dame Pertelote, I tell you verily,  
Macrobius, who wrote th’avision  
Of Scipio Africus, affirms of dreams  
And says that they are warnings of such things  
That afterward to men have come to pass.

“And furthermore, I pray you to look well  
In the Old Testament, in Daniel’s book,  
If he held dreams for any mere vanity.  
Read too of Joseph, and there shall ye see  
Where dreams have been, sometimes (I say not all),  
Warnings of things that after did befall.

Look of Egypt’s king, dame Pharaoh, also,  
His baker and his butler — were they so  
That they felt no effect of dreams at all?  
Who will seek acts of sundry realms’ recall  
May read of dreams many a wondrous thing.

Lo, Croesus, who was once of Lydia king,  
Dreamed he not that he sat upon a tree,  
Which signified that hanged high he should be?  
Lo, Andromache, great Hector’s wife,  
That day that Hector should lose his life,  
She dreamed upon the very night before  
That Hector’s life should be lost forevermore,  
If on that day he went into the battle;  
She warned him, but it might not aid his fate;  
He went for to fight, nonetheless,  
And was anon slain by Achilles.

But that tale is all too long to tell,  
And, too, it is near day — I may not dwell.  
Shortly I say, as for conclusion,  
That I shall have of this vision  
Adversity; and I say furthermore,  
That I set by laxatives no store,  
For they are venomous, I know it well;  
I them defy, I love them never a del.

Now let us speak of mirth, and stint all this;  
Madame Pertelote, so have I bliss,  
Of one thing God hath given me large grace:  
For when I see the beauty of your face,  
You are so scarlet-red about your eyes,  
It maketh all my dread for to die.  
For, as surely as *In principio*,  
*Mulier est hominis confusio*;  
Madame, the sentence of this Latin is —  
Woman is man’s delight and all his bliss.

For when I feel at night your tender side,  
Although I may not then upon you ride —  
Because our perch is made so narrow, alas! —  
I am so full of joy and of solace  
That I defy both vision and dream.”

And with that word he flew down from off the beam,  
For it was day, and down went all his hens;  
And with a cluck he gan them for to call,  
For he had found some corn within the yard.

Regal he was, and fears he did discard.  
He’d feathered Pertelote full many a time,  
And twenty times he trod her ere ’twas prime.  
He looked as if he were a grim lion,  
As on his toes he strutted up and down;  
He deigned not to set his foot upon the ground.  
He clucked when any grain of corn he found,  
And all his wives came running at his call,  
Thus regal, as a prince is in his hall.

I’ll now leave busy Chanticleer to feed,  
And with the events that followed I proceed.

When that same month wherein the world began,  
Which is called March, wherein God first made man,  
Was ended, and were passed of days also —  
Since March began, full thirty days and two —  
It fell that Chanticleer, in all his pride,  
His seven wives a-walking by his side,  
Cast up his two eyes toward the great bright sun  
(Which through the sign of Taurus now had run  
Twenty degrees and one, and somewhat more),  
And knew by instinct and by no other lore  
That it was prime, and joyfully he crew:

“The sun, my love,” he said, “has climbed anew  
Forty degrees and one, and somewhat more.  
My lady Pertelote, whom I adore,  
Mark now these happy birds, hear how they sing,  
And see all these fresh flowers, how they spring;  
Full is my heart of revelry and grace.”

But suddenly he fell in grievous case;  
For ever the latter end of joy is woe.  
God knows that worldly joys do swiftly go;  
And if a rhetorician could but write,  
He in some chronicle might well indite  
And mark it down as sovereign in degree.  
Now every wise man, let him hark to me;  
This tale is just as true, I undertake,  
As is the book of Launcelot of the Lake,  
Which women always hold in such esteem.

But now I must take up my proper theme.  
A brant-fox, full of sly iniquity,  
That in the grove had lived two years or three,  
Now by a fine premeditated plot  
That same night, breaking through the hedge, had got  
Into the yard where Chanticleer the fair  
Was wont, and all his wives too, to repair;  
And in a bed of greenery still he lay  
Till it was past the quarter of the day,  
Waiting his chance on Chanticleer to fall,  
As gladly do these killers one and all  
Who lie in ambush to make murder men.

O murderer false, there lurking in your den!  
O new Iscariot, O new Ganelon!  
O false dissimulator, Greek Sinon  
That brought down Troy all utterly to sorrow!  
O Chanticleer, accursed be that morrow  
When you into that yard flew from the beams!  
You were well warned, and fully, by your dreams  
That this day should hold peril damnably.  
But that which God foreknows, it needs must be,  
So says the best opinion of the clerks.

Witness some cleric perfect for his works,  
That in the schools there is great altercation  
In this matter, and much disputation,  
And hath been of an hundred thousand men.  
But I cannot set it to the bran with pen,  
As can the holy Doctor Augustine,  
Or Boethius, or the bishop Bradwardine,  
Whether that God’s worthy forewiting  
Straineth me needly for to do a thing  
(Needly clepe I simple necessity);  
Or else, if free choice be granted me  
To do that same thing, or do it not,  
Though God foreknew it ere that it was wrought;  
Or if his witting straineth never a del  
But by necessity conditional.

I will not have to do of such matter;  
My tale is of a cock, as ye may hear,  
That took his counsel of his wife, with sorrow,  
To walk in the yard upon that morrow  
That he had met the dream that I you told.  
Women’s counsels be full often cold;  
Woman’s counsel brought us first to woe,  
And made Adam from Paradise to go,  
There as he was full merry and well at ease. —  
But for I know not to whom it might displease  
If I of women’s counsel would complain,  
Pass over, for I said it in my game.  
Read authors, where they treat of such matter,  
And what they say of women ye may hear.

These be the cock’s words, and not myne;  
I can no harm of any woman divine. —  
Fair in the sand, to bathe her merrily,  
Lies Pertelote, and all her sisters by,  
Against the sun; and Chanticleer so free  
Sings merrier than the mermaid in the sea,  
For Physiologus says certainly  
That they sing well and merrily.

And so befell that, as he cast his eye  
Among the herbs, upon a butterfly,  
He was aware of this fox that lay full low.  
Nothing then listed him for to crow;  
But cried anon, “Cock, cock!” and up he sterte,  
As man that was affrayed in his herte.  
For naturally a beast desireth flight  
From his contrary, if he may it see,  
Though never erst he had seen it with his eye.

When Chanticleer the fox did then espy,  
He would have fled, but that the fox anon  
Said: “Gentle sire, alas! Where will ye gon?  
Be ye afraid of me that am your friend?  
Now certes, I were worse than any fiend  
If I to you would do harm or villany.  
I am not come your counsel for to spy;  
But trewely, the cause of my coming here  
Was only for to hearken how that ye sing.

“For trewely ye have as merry a stevene  
As any angel hath that is in heaven;  
Therewith ye have in music more feeling  
Than had Boethius, or any that can sing.  
My lord your father (God his soul bless!),  
And eke your mother, of her gentleness,  
Have been in my abode, to my great ease,  
And truly, sir, right fain am I to please.

“But since men speak of singing, I will say  
(As I still have my eyesight day by day),  
Save you, I never heard a man so sing  
As did your father in the grey dawning;  
Truly ’twas from the heart his every song.  
And that his voice might ever be more strong,  
He took such pains that, with his either eye,  
He had to blink, so loudly would he cry,  
Astanding on his tiptoes therewithal,  
Stretching his neck till it grew long and small.

“And such discretion, too, by him was shown,  
There was no man in any region known  
That him in song or wisdom could surpass.  
I have read well in Dan Burnell the Ass,  
Among his verses, how there was a cock,  
Because a priest’s son gave him a knock  
Upon the leg, while young and not yet wise,  
He caused the boy to lose his benefice.  
But truly, there is no comparison  
With the great wisdom and the discretion  
Your father had, or with his subtlety.

“Now sing, dear sir, for holy charity,  
See if you can your father counterfeit.”

This Chanticleer his wings began to beat,  
As one that could no treason there espy,  
So was he ravished by this flattery.  
Alas, you lords! Full many a flatterer  
Is in your courts, and many a cozener,  
That please your honours much more, by my fay,  
Than he that truth and justice dares to say.  
Go read the Ecclesiast on flattery;  
Beware, my lords, of all their treachery!

This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,  
Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close,  
And so did crow right loudly, for the nonce;  
And Russell Fox started up at once,  
And by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer,  
Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,  
For there was no man who as yet pursued.

O destiny, thou canst not be eschewed!  
Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!  
Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!  
And on a Friday fell all this mischance.

O Venus, who art goddess of pleasance,  
Since he did serve thee well, this Chanticleer,  
And to the utmost of his power here,  
More for delight than cocks to multiply,  
Why wouldst thou suffer him that day to die?  
O Gaufred, my dear master sovereign,  
Who, when King Richard Lionheart was slain  
By arrow, sang his death with sorrow sore,  
Why have I not your faculty and lore  
To chide Friday, as you did worthily?  
(For truly, on a Friday slain was he.)  
Then would I prove how well I could complain  
For Chanticleer’s great fear and all his pain.

Certainly no such cry and lamentation  
Were made by ladies at Troy’s desolation.

## Continuation (Modern English — cleaned)

I have been in my abode, to my great ease,  
And truly, sir, right fain am I to please.  
But for men speak of singing, I will say,  
So mote I brook well mine two chickens twain,  
Save you, I never heard a man so sing  
As did your father in the morninging;  
Certes it was of heart, all that he sang.

And for to make his voice the more strong,  
He would so pain himself that with both his eyes  
He must needs wink, so loud he would cry,  
And stand upon his tip-toe therewithal,  
And stretch forth his neck long and small.  
And eke he was of such discretion,  
That there was no man in no region  
That him in song or wisdom might surpass.

I have well read in Daun Burnel the Ass,  
Among his verse, how that there was a cock,  
For that a priest’s son gave him a knock  
Upon his leg, while he was young and nice;  
He made him for to lose his benefice.  
But certes, there is no comparison  
With your father’s great wisdom and discretion.

Now sing, dear sir, for holy charity,  
See if you can your father counterfeit.”

This Chanticleer his wings began to beat,  
As one that could no treason there espy;  
So was he ravished by this flattery.

Alas, you lords! Full many a flatterer  
Is in your courts, and many a cozen-er,  
That please your honours much more, by my fay,  
Than he that truth and justice dares to say.  
Go read the Ecclesiastic on flattery;  
Beware, my lords, of all their treachery!

This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,  
Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close,  
And so he crowed right loudly, for the nonce;  
And Russell Fox started up at once,  
And by the gorget seized Chanticleer,  
Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,  
For there was none that as yet had pursued.

O destiny, thou canst not be eschewed!  
Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!  
Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!  
And on a Friday fell all this mischance.

O Venus, who art goddess of pleasance,  
Since he did serve thee well, this Chanticleer,  
And to the utmost of his power here  
More for delight than cocks to multiply,  
Why wouldst thou suffer him that day to die?  
O Gaufred, my dear master sovereign,  
Who, when King Richard Lionheart was slain  
By arrow, sang his death with sorrow sore,  
Why have I not your faculty and lore  
To chide Friday, as you did worthily?  
(For truly, on a Friday slain was he.)

Then would I prove how well I could complain  
For Chanticleer’s great fear and all his pain.  
Certainly no such cry and lamentation  
Were made by ladies at Troy’s desolation.

# THE SECOND NUN’S PROLOGUE

## The Prologue of the Second Nun’s Tale

The ministre and the norice unto vices,  
Which that men clepe in English Idelnesse,  
That porter of the gate is of delyces,  
T'eschue, and by hir contrarie hir oppresse.  
That is to seyn, by leveful bisinesse  
We oghte to doon al our entente,  
Lest that the feend thurgh ydelnesse us hente.  

For he, that with his thousand cordes slye  
Continuelly us waiteth to biclappe,  
Whan he may man in ydelnesse espye,  
He can so lightly cacche him in his trappe,  
Til that a man be hent right by the lappe,  
He nis nat war the feend hath him in honde;  
We oghte us werche, and ydelnesse withstonde.  

And though men dradden never for to dye,  
Yet seen men wel by reson doutelees,  
That ydelnesse is roten slogardye,  
Of which ther never comth no good encrees;  
And seen, that slouthe hir holdeth in a lees  
Only to slepe, and for to ete and drinke,  
And to devouren al that othere swinke.  

And for to putte us fro swich ydelnesse,  
That cause is of so greet confusioun,  
I have heer doon my feithful bisinesse,  
After the legende, in translacioun  
Right of thy glorious lyf and passioun,  
Thou with thy gerland wroght of rose and lilie;  
Thee mene I, mayde and martir, seint Cecilie!

### Invocation

And thou that flour of virgines art alle,  
Of whom that Bernard list so wel to wryte,  
To thee at my biginning first I calle;  
Thou comfort of us wrecches, do me endyte  
Thy maydens deeth, than wan thurgh hir meryte  
The eternal lyf, and of the feend victorie,  
As man may after reden in hir storie.  

Thou mayde and mooder, doghter of thy sone,  
Thou welle of mercy, sinful soules cure,  
In whom that God, for bountee, chees to wone,  
Thou humble, and heigh over every creature,  
Thou nobledest so ferforth our nature  
That no desdeyn the maker hadde of kinde  
His sone in blode and flesh to clothe and winde.  

Withinne the cloistre blisful of thy sydes  
Took mannes shap the eternal love and pees,  
That of the trine compas lord and gyde is,  
Whom erthe and see and heven, out of relees,  
Ay herien; and thou, virgin wemmelees,  
Bar of thy body—and wert kept a maid—  
Assembled is in thee magnificence,  
With mercy, goodness, and with swich pitee,  
That thou, that art the sonne of excellence,  
Nat only helpest hem that preyen thee;  
But ofte tyme, of thy benignitee,  
Ful frely, er that men thy help biseche,  
Thou goost biforn, and art hir lyves leche.  

Now help, thou meke and blisful fayre mayde,  
Me, flemed wrecche, in this desert of galle;  
Think on the womman Cananee, that sayde  
That whelpes eten somme of the crommes alle  
That from hir lordes table been y-falle;  
And though that I, unworthy sone of Eve,  
Be sinful, yet accepte my bileve.  

And, for that feith is deed withouten werkes,  
So for to werken yif me wit and space,  
That I be quit fro thennes that most derk is!  
O thou, that art so fayr and ful of grace,  
Be myn advocat in that heighe place  
Ther-as withouten ende is songe "Osanna,"  
Thou Cristes mooder, doghter dere of Anne!  

And of thy light my soule in prison lighte,  
That troubled is by the contagioun  
Of my body, and also by the wighte  
Of erthly luste and fals affeccioun;  
O haven of refut, o salvacioun  
Of hem that been in sorwe and in distresse,  
Now help, for to my werk I wol me dresse.  

Yet preye I yow that reden that I wryte,  
Foryeve me, that I do no diligence  
This ilke storie subtilly to endyte;  
For both have I the wordes and sentence  
Of him that at the seintes reverence  
The storie wroot, and folwe hir legende,  
And prey yow, that ye wol my werk amende.

### The interpretation of the name Cecilia (as in the Legenda Aurea)

First wolde I yow the name of Seint Cecilie  
Expoune, as men may in hir storie see;  
It is to seye in English "hevenes lilie,"  
For pure chastnesse of virginitee;  
Or, for she whytnesse hadde of honestee,  
And grene of conscience, and of good fame  
The sote savour, "lilie" was hir name.  

Or else Cecile is to seye "the wey to blinde,"  
For she ensample was by good techinge;  
Or, dies Cecile, as I writen finde,  
Is joyned, by a maner conjoininge,  
Of "hevene" and "Lia"; and heer, in figuringe,  
The "heven" is set for thoght of holincesse,  
And "Lia" for hir lasting bisinesse.  

"Lacking of blindnesse," for hir gret light  
Of sapience, and for hir thewes clere;  
Or elles, lo! this maydens name bright  
Of "hevene" and "leos" comth, for which by right  
Men mighte hir wel "the heven of peple" calle,  
Ensample of gode and wyse werkes alle.  
For "leos" — "peple" in English is to seye.  

And right so as men may in the hevene see  
The sonne and mone and sterres every weye,  
Right so men gostly, in this mayden free,  
Seyen of feith the magnanimitee,  
And eek the cleernesse hool of sapience,  
And sondry werkes, brighte of excellence.  

And right so as thise philosophres write  
That heven is swift and round and eek brenninge,  
Right so was fayre Cecilie the white,  
Ful swift and bisy ever in good werkinge,  
And round and hool in good perseveringe,  
And brenning ever in charitee ful brighte;  
Now have I yow declared what she highte.

HERE IT ENDETH

# THE SECOND NUN’S TALE

## Here beginneth the Second Nun’s Tale, of the Life of Saint Cecilia

This mayden bright, Cecilie, as hir lyf seith,  
Was comen of Romayns, and of noble kinde,  
And from hir cradel up fostred in the feith  
Of Crist, and bar his gospel in hir minde;  
She never cessed, as I writen finde,  
Of hir preyere, and God to love and drede,  
Biseking him to kepe hir maydenhede.  

And whan this mayden sholde unto a man  
Be wedded, who was a young man in age,  
And who that was y-cleped Valerian,  
And whan the day was comen of hir mariage,  
She, meek of herte, devout, and ever sage,  
Under hir robe of gold, well-mayd and fayre,  
Had next hir body placed a shirt of hayre.  

And whil the organnes maden melodye,  
To God alone in hirte thus sang she:  
"O Lord, my soule and eek my body gye  
Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be";  
And for his love that deyde upon a tree,  
Every seconde or thridde day she faste,  
Ay biddinge in hir orisons ful faste.  

The night cam, and to bedde moste she gon  
With hir housbonde, as ofte is the manere;  
And prively to him she seyde anon,  
"O swete and wel biloved spouse dere,  
Ther is a conseil, and ye wolde it here,  
Which that right fain I wolde unto yow seye,  
So that ye swere ye shul me nat biwreye."  

Valerian to hir his ooth dyde swerre,  
That evermore, what thing that mighte be,  
He nevere wolde biwreyen that he herde there;  
And thanne at erst to him thus seyde she,  
"I have an angel which that loveth me,  
That with greet love, wher-so I wake or slepe,  
Is redy ay my body for to kepe.  

And if that he may felen, out of drede,  
That ye me touche or love in vilinye,  
He right anon wol slee yow with the dede,  
And in your youthe thus shul ye dye, certeynly;  
And if that ye in clene love me gye,  
He wol yow loven as me, for your cleennesse,  
And shewe yow his joye and his brightnesse."  

Valerian, checked thus as God wolde,  
Answerde agayn, "If I shal truste thee,  
Lat me that angel see, and him biholde;  
And if that it a verray angel be,  
Than wol I doon as thou hast preyed me;  
And if thou love another man, for sothe,  
Right with this swerd than wol I slee yow bothe."  

Cecile answerde anon right in this wyse,  
"If that yow list, the angel shul ye see,  
So that ye trowe on Crist and yow baptyse.  
Goth forth to Via Appia," quod she,  
"That fro this toun ne stant but myles three,  
And to the povre folkes that ther dwelle,  
Sey hem right thus, as that I shal yow telle:  

'Telle hem that I, Cecilia, have sent  
You to the good man Urban, who is old,  
For secret cause, and with a good entent;  
And whan this holy Urban you behold,  
Telle him the thing that I to you have told;  
And whan he shal have purged you of your syn,  
That angel shal you see ere thence ye wynn.'"  

Valerian to that place he goth anoon,  
And found this olde man within a cave,  
Among the holy catacumbes y-goon;  
And anon, with-outen any more to crave,  
He told his errand; and whan it was y-sawe,  
This holy man up-lift his handes two,  
And wepte for joy and thanked God also.

(Here the tale continues in the legend of Saint Cecilia.)

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

For in a bath they locked her and began  
(All night and day) a great fire to fan.  

The long night through, and a long day also,  
For all the fire and all the bath’s great heat,  

He stareth and woodeth in his advertence!

To whom Almachius, “unsely wrecche,  
Ne woostow nat how far my might may strecche?  
Han noght our mighty princes to me yeven,  
Ye, bothe power and auctoritee  
To maken folk to dyen or to liven?  
Why spekestow so proudly than to me?”

“I speke noght but stedfastly,” quod she,  
“Nat proudly, for I seye, as for my syde,  
We haten deedly thilke vyce of pryde.  
And if thou drede nat a sooth to here,  
Than wol I shewe al openly, by right,  
That thou hast maad a ful gret lesing here.  
Thou seyst, thy princes han thee yeven might  
Bothe for to sleen and for to quiken a wight;  
Thou, that ne mayst but only lyf bireve.  
Thou hast non other power ne no level  
But thou mayst seyn, thy princes han thee maked  
Ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo,  
Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked.”

“Do wey thy boldnes,” seyde Almachius tho,  
“And sacrifye to our goddes, er thou go;  
I recche nat what wrong that thou me profre.  
For I can suffre it as a philosophre;  
But thilke wronges may I nat endure  
That thou spekest of our goddes here,” quod he.

Cecile answerede, “O nyce creature,  
Thou seydest no word sin thou spak to me  
That I ne knew therwith thy nycetee;  
And that thou were, in every maner wyse,  
A lewed officer and a veyn justyse.  
Ther lakketh no-thing to thyn utter yen  
That thou nart blind, for thing that we seen alle  
That it is stoon, that men may wel espyen,  
That ilke stoon a god thou wolt it calle.  
I rede thee, lat thyn hand upon it falle,  
And taste it wel, and stoon thou shalt it finde,  
Sin that thou seest nat with thyn yen blinde.  
It is a shame that the peple shal  
So scorne thee, and laughe at thy folye;  
For comunly men woot it wel overal,  
That mighty god is in his hevenes hye,  
And thise images, wel thou mayst espye,  
To thee ne to hem-self mowe nought profyte,  
For in effect they been nat worth a myte.”

Thise wordes and swiche othere seyde she,  
And he weex wroth, and bad men sholde hir lede  
Horn til hir hous, “and in hir hous,” quod he,  
“Brenne hir right in a bath of flambes rede.”

And as he bad, right so was doon in dede;  
For in a bath they gonne hir faste shetten.  
And night and day greet fyr they under betten.  
The longe night and eek a day also,  
For al the fyr and eek the bathes hete.

She sat al cold, and felede no wo,  
It made hir nat a drope for to swete.  
But in that bath hir lyf she moste lete;  
For he, Almachius, with ful wikke entente  
To sleen hir in the bath his sonde sente.  
Three strokes in the nekke he smoot hir tho.  
The tormentour, but for no maner chaunce  
He mighte noght smyte al hir nekke a-two;  
And for ther was that tyme an ordinaunce  
That no man sholde doon man swich penaunce  
The ferthe strook to smyten, softe or sore.  
This tormentour ne dorste do na-more.

But half-deed, with hir nekke y-corven there,  
He lefte hir lye, and on his wey is went.  
The Cristen folk, which that aboute hir were,  
With shetes han the blood ful faire y-hent.  
Three dayes lived she in this torment.  
And never cessed hem the feith to teche;  
That she hadde fostred, hem she gan to preche;  
And hem she yaf hir moebles and hir thing.  
And to the pope Urban bitook hem tho.  
And seyde, “I axed this at hevene king  
To han respyt three dayes and na-mo,  
To recomende to yow, er that I go  
Thise soules, lo! and that I mighte do werche  
Here of myn hous perpetuelly a cherche.”

Seint Urban, with his deknes, prively  
The body fette, and buried it by nighte  
Among his othere seintes honestly.  
Hir hous the chirche of seint Cecilie highte;  
Seint Urban halwed it, as he wel mighte;  
In which, into this day, in noble wyse,  
Men doon to Crist and to his seint servyse.

She sat there cool and calm and felt no woe,  
Nor did it make her any drop to sweat.  
But in that bath her life should she lose yet;  
For he, Almachius, with bad intent,  
To slay her in the bath his headsman sent.  
The executioner three times her smote  
Upon the neck, and could not strike again,  
Although he failed to cut in two her throat.  
For at that time the ordinance was plain  
That no man might another give the pain  
Of striking four blows, whether soft or sore;  
This executioner dared do no more.

But half dead, with her neck cut three times there,  
He let her lie, and on his way he went.  
The Christian folk that all about her were,  
With sheets caught up the precious blood she spent;  
And three days lived she in this same torment,  
But never ceased at all the faith to teach  
That she had fostered; dying did she preach;  
To them she gave her goods and everything,  
And of Pope Urban put them in the care,  
And said: “This much I asked of Heaven’s King,  
A respite of three days, that you might share  
With me these souls; and too I would prepare  
Before I go my house a church to make,  
That it be kept forever for my sake.”

Saint Urban, with his deacons, privately,  
The body took and buried it by night  
Among his other saints, right honourably.  
Her house is Church of Saint Cecilia hight;  
Saint Urban hallowed it, as well he might;  
Wherein in noble wise unto this day  
To Christ and to His saint men service pay.

## THE CANON’S YEOMAN’S PROLOGUE

Whan ended was the lyf of seint Cecyle,  
Er we had riden fully five myle,  
At Boghton under Blee us gan atake  
A man, that clothed was in clothes blake.  
And undemethe he hadde a whyt surplys.  
His hackney, that was al pomely grys,  
So swatte, that it wonder was to see;  
It semed he had priked myles three.  
The hors eek that his yeman rood upon  
So swatte, that unnethe mighte it gon.  
Aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye.  
He was of fome al flekked as a pye.  
A male tweyfold on his croper lay.  
It semed that he caried lyte array.  
Al light for somer rood this worthy man.  
And in myn herte wondren I bigan  
What that he was, til that I understood  
The way he had his cloak sewed to his hood;  
From which, when long I had communed with me,  
I judged at length some canon he muste be.  
His hat hung on his back down by a lace,  
For he had ridden more than trot or pace;  
He had spurred hard, indeed, as madman would.  
A burdock leaf he had beneath his hood  
To curb the sweat and keep his head from heat.  
But what a joy it was to see him sweat!  
His forehead dripped as a distillatory  
Were full of plantain and of pellitory.  
And this man when he came began to cry:  
“God save,” said he, “this jolly company!  
Fast I have spurred,” said he then, “for your sake,  
Because I wanted you to overtake,  
To ride on in this merry company.”

His yeoman too was full of courtesy,  
And said: “Good sirs, all in the morningtide  
Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,  
And warned my lord and master, full and plain,  
And he to ride with you is truly fain  
For his amusement; he loves dalliance.”

“Friend, for your warning, God give you good chance,”  
Said then our host, “for truly it would seem  
Your lord is wise, and so I may well deem;  
He is right jocund also, I dare lay.  
Can he a merry tale tell, on the way,  
Wherewith to gladden this our company?”

“Who, sir? My lord? Yea, yea, without a lie,  
He knows of mirth and of all jollity,  
Not but enough; and also, sir, trust me,  
If you but knew him as well as do I,  
You’d wonder much how well and craftily  
He can behave, and that in different wise.  
He’s taken on him many an enterprise  
That were right hard for anyone that’s here  
(Unless he learned it) to effect, I fear.

As plainly as he rides, here among you,  
It would be to your profit if you knew  
Him well; you’d not give up his acquaintance  
For much of wealth, I dare lay in balance  
All that I have of goods in my possession.  
He is a man of wondrous high discretion,  
I warn you well, he’s a surpassing man.”

“Well,” said our host, “then pray tell, if you can,  
Is he a clerk, or not? Tell what he is.”

“Nay, he is greater than a clerk, ywis,”  
This yeoman said, “and briefly, if you’ll wait,  
Host, of his craft a little I’ll relate.

“I say, my lord has so much subtlety  
(But all his art you cannot learn from me,  
And yet I help by working at his side),  
That all this pleasant land through which we ride,  
From here right into Canterbury town,  
Why, he could turn it all clean upside-down  
And pave it all with silver and with gold.”

And when this yeoman had this story told  
Unto our host, our host said: “Ben cite!  
This thing is wondrous marvelous to me,  
Since your lord is a man of such science,  
That of his worship rekketh he so lyte;  
His oversloppe nis nat worth a myte,  
As in effect, to him, so mote I go!  
It is al baudy and to-tore also.  
Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee preye,  
And is of power better cloth to beye,  
If that his dede accorde with thy speche?  
Telle me that, and that I thee biseche.”

“Why?” quod this yeoman, “wherto axe ye me?  
God help me so, for he shal never thee!  
(But I wol nat avowe that I seye.  
And therfor kepe it secree, I yow preye).  
He is to wys, in feith, as I bileve;  
That that is overdoon, it wol nat preve  
Aright, as clerkes seyn, it is a vyce.  
Wherfor in that I holde him lewed and nyce.  
For whan a man hath over-greet a wit,  
Ful oft him happeth to misusen it;  
So dooth my lord, and that me greveth sore.  
God it amende, I can sey yow na-more.”

“Ther-of no fors, good yeman,” quod our host;  
“Sin of the conning of thy lord thou wost,  
Tel how he dooth, I pray thee hertely.  
Sin that he is so crafty and so sly.  
Wher dwellen ye, if it to telle be?”

“In the suburbes of a toun,” quod he,  
“Lurkinge in hemes and in lanes blinde,  
Wher-as thise robbours and thise theves by kinde  
Holden hir privee fereful residence,  
As they that dar nat shewen hir presence;  
So faren we, if I shal seye the sothe.”

“Now,” quod our host, “yit lat me talke to thee;  
Why artow so discoloured of thy face?”

“Peter!” quod he, “God yeve it harde grace,  
I am so used in the fyr to blowe,  
That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.  
I am nat wont in no mirour to prye,  
But swinke sore and leme multiplye.  
We blondren ever and pouren in the fyr,  
And for al that we fayle of our desyr,  
For ever we lakken our conclusioun.  
To mochel folk we doon illusioun.  
And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,  
Or ten, or twelve, or many sommes mo,  
And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye,  
That of a pound we coude make tweye!  
Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope  
It for to doon, and after it we grope.  
But that science is so fer us biforn,  
We mowen nat, al-though we hadde it sworn.  
It overtake, it slit awey so faste;  
It wol us maken beggers atte laste.”

Whyl this yeoman was thus in his talking,  
This chanoun drough him neer, and herde al thing  
Which this yeoman spak, for suspecioun  
Of mennes speche ever hadde this chanoun.  
For Catoun seith, that he that gilty is  
Demeth al thing be spoke of him, y-wis.  
That was the cause he gan so ny him drawe  
To his yeoman, his gossiping to hear.

And thus he seyde unto his yeoman tho,  
“Hold thou thy pecs, and spek no wordes mo.  
For if thou do, thou shalt it dere abye;  
Thou sclaundrest me heer in this companye,  
And eek discoverest that thou sholdest hyde.”

“Yea,” quod our host, “telle on, what so bityde;  
Of al his threting rekke nat a myte!”

“In feith,” quod he, “namore I do but lyte.”  
And whan this chanoun saugh it wolde nat be,  
But his yeoman wolde telle his privetee,  
He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame.

“A!” quod the yeoman, “heer shal aryse game,  
Al that I can anon now wol I telle.  
Sin he is goon, the foule feend him quelle!  
For never her-after wol I with him mete  
For peny ne for pound, I yow bihete!  
He that me broghte first unto that game,  
Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame!  
For it is ernest to me, by my feith;  
That fele I wel, what so any man seith.  
And yet, for al my smerte and al my grief,  
For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,  
I coude never leve it in no wyse.  
Now wolde god my wit mighte suffyse  
To tellen al that longeth to that art!  
But natheles yow wol I tellen part;  
Sin that my lord is gon, I wol nat spare;  
Swich thing as that I knowe, I wol declare.”

## THE CANON’S YEOMAN’S TALE

### HERE BEGINNETH THE CANON’S YEOMAN HIS TALE — First Part

Seven years I’ve served this canon, but no more  
I know about his science than before.  
All that I had I have quite lost thereby;  
And, God knows, so have many more than I.  
Where I was wont to be right fresh and gay  
Of clothing and of other good array,  
Now may I wear my old hose on my head;  
And where my colour was both fresh and red,  
Now it is wan and of a leaden hue;  
Whoso this science follows, he shall rue.  
And from my toil yet bleary is my eye,  
Behold the gain it is to multiply!  
That slippery science has made me so bare  
That I’ve no goods, wherever I may fare;  
And I am still indebted so thereby  
For gold that I have borrowed, truthfully,  
That while I live I shall repay it never.  
Let every man be warned by me for ever!  
And any man who casts his lot thereon,  
If he continue, I hold his thrift gone.  
So help me God, thereby he shall not win,  
But empty purse and have his wits grow thin.  
And when he, through his madness and folly,  
Has lost his own, by willing jeopardy,  
Then will he incite others, many a one,  
To lose their wealth as he himself has done.  
For unto shrewes joye it is and ese  
To have hir felawes in peyne and disese;  
Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk.  
Of that no charge, I wol speke of our werk.

When we been ther as we shul exercyse  
Our elvish craft, we semen wonder wyse.  
Our termes been so clergial and so queynte.  
I blowe the fyr til that myn herte feynte.  
What sholde I tellen ech proporcioun  
Of thinges whiche that we werche upon,  
As on five or sixe ounces, may wel be,  
Of silver or som other quantitee,  
And bisie me to telle yow the names  
Of orpiment, brent bones, yren squames,  
That into poudre grounden been ful smal?  
And in an erthen potte how put is al,  
And salt y-put in, and also paper,  
Bifore thise poudres that I speke of heer,  
And wel y-covered with a lampe of glas,  
And mochel other thing which that ther was?  
And of the pot and glasses enluting,  
That of the eyre mighte passe out no-thing?  
And of the esy fyr and smart also,  
Which that was maad, and of the care and wo  
That we hadde in our matires sublyming,  
And in amalgaming and calcening  
Of quik-silver, y-clept Mercurie crude?  
For alle our sleightes we can nat conclude.  
Our orpiment and sublymed Mercurie,  
Our grounden litarge eek on the porphurie,  
Of ech of thise of ounces a certeyn  
Nought helpeth us, our labour is in veyn.  
Ne eek our spirites ascencioun,  
Ne our materes that lyen al fixe adoun,  
Mowe in our werking no-thing us avayle.  
For lost is al our labour and travayle,  
And al the cost, a twenty devel weye,  
Is lost also, which we upon it leye.  
Ther is also ful many another thing  
That is unto our craft apertening;  
Though I by ordre hem nat reherce can,  
By-cause that I am a lewed man.  
Yet wol I telle hem as they come to minde,  
Though I ne can nat sette hem in hir kinde;  
As bole armoniak, verdegrees, boras,  
And sondry vessels maad of erthe and glas.  
Our urinales and our descensories,  
Violes, croslets, and sublymatories,  
Cucurbites, and alembykes eek,  
And othere swiche, dere ynough a leek.  
Nat nedeth it for to reherce hem alle,  
Watres rubifying and boles galle,  
Arsenik, sal armoniak, and brimstoon;  
And herbes coude I telle eek many oon,  
As egremoine, valerian, and lunarie,  
And othere swiche, if that me liste tarie.  
Our lampes brenning bothe night and day  
To bringe about our craft, if that we may.  
Our foumeys eek of calcinacioun,  

Then will he incite others, many a one,  
To lose their wealth as he himself has done.

For unto scoundrels it’s a pleasant thing  
Their fellows in distress and pain to bring.  
Thus was I taught once by a learned clerk.  
Of that no matter; I’ll speak of our work.

When we are where we choose to exercise  
Our elvish craft, why, we seem wondrous wise;  
Our terms are all so learned and so quaint.  
I blow the fire till my heart’s like to faint.

Why tell you what proportions of things went  
In working out each new experiment,  
As five ounces, or six, it may well be,  
Of silver, or some other quantity?  
Or tell you all the names, my memory fails,  
Of orpiment, burnt bones, and iron scales  
That into powder we ground fine and small?  
Or in an earthen pot how we put all,  
And salt put in, and also pepper dear,  
Before these powders that I speak of here,  
And covered all these with a plate of glass,  
And of the various other gear there was?  
And of the sealing of the pot and glass,  
So that the air might no way from it pass?  
And of the slow fire and the forced also,  
Which we made there, and of the care and woe  
That we took in our matter’s sublimating,  
And in calcining and amalgamating  
Quicksilver, which is known as mercury crude?  
For all our skill, we never could conclude.  
Our orpiment and sublimed mercury,  
Our litharge that we ground on porphyry,  
Of each some certain ounces— it is plain  
Naught helped us, all our labour was in vain.  
Neither the gases that by nature rose  
Nor solid matter either— none of those  
Might, in our working, anything avail.

For lost was all our labour and travail,  
And all the cost, the devil’s own to pay.  
Was lost also, for we made no headway.  
There is also full many another thing  
That to our craft pertains in labouring.  
Though name them properly I never can,  
Because, indeed, I am an ignorant man,  
Yet will I tell them as they come to mind,  
Though I’ll not try to class each one by kind:  
Armenian bole, borax, the green of brass,  
And sundry vessels made of earth and glass,  
Our urinals and all our descensories,  
Vials and crucibles, sublimatories,  
Cucurbites, and alembics, and such freaks,  
All dear enough if valued at two leeks.  
There is no need to specify them all,  
The reddening waters and the dark bull’s gall,  
Arsenic, sal ammoniac, and brimstone;  
And, too, of herbs could I name many a one:  
Valerian, agrimony, and lunary,  
And others such, if but wished to tarry.  
Our lamps burning both night and day  
To bring about our craft, if that we may,  
Our fumes too of calcination, and more—  

(Here the tale continues.)

When he communicates with any wight,  
That he soon makes a fool of him outright,  
Unless it be a devil, as he is.

Full many a man has he beguiled ere this,  
And will, it he may, live yet a while;  
And yet men walk and ride full many a mile  
To seek him and to have his acquaintance,  
Naught knowing of his treacherous simulance.

And if you care to listen to me here,  
I will make the proof of what I say quite clear.

But most religious canons, just and true,  
Do not suppose I slander your house or you,  
Although my tale may of a canon be.

Some rogue’s in every order, pardon me,  
And God forbid that for one rascal’s sake  
Against a group we condemnation make.

To slander you is nowise my intent,  
But to correct what is amiss I’m bent.

This tale I tell here not alone for you,  
But even for others, too; you know full well  
That, among Christ’s apostles twelve,  
There was not one but Judas who did sell.

Then why should all the rest be put to blame  
Who guiltless were? Of you I say the same.

Save only this, if you will list to me,  
If any Judas in your convent be,  
Remove the man betimes, I counsel you,  
Lest shame or loss or trouble should ensue.

And be displeased in nothing, I you pray,  
But hear what on this matter I may say.

## THE CANON'S YEOMAN'S TALE

In London was a priest, an annualeer,  
That therein dwelled had many a year.

Who was so pleasant and so serviceable  
Unto the wife where-as he was at table,  
That she would suffer him nothing for to pay  
For board nor clothing, went he never so gay;  
And spending-silver had he right enow.  
Therof no fors; I will proceed as now.

And tell forth my tale of the canon,  
That brought this priest to confusion.

This false canon came upon a day  
Unto this priest's chamber, where he lay,  
Beseeching him to lend him a certain  
Of gold, and he would quite it him again.

“Lend me a mark,” quod he, “but days three,  
And at my day I will it quite thee.  
And if so be that thou me finde false,  
Another day do hang me by the hals!”

This priest him took a mark, and that as swythe.  
And this canon him thanked ofte sythe.  
And took his leave, and went forth his way,  
And at the third day brought his money.

And to the priest he took his gold again,  
Wherof this priest was wonder glad and fain.

“Certes,” quod he, “nothing annoyeth me  
To lend a man a noble, or two or three,  
Or what thing were in my possession.  
When he so trewe is of condition,  
That in no wise he breake will his day;  
To such a man I can never say nay.”

---

“What!” cried this canon, “should I be untrue?  
Nay, that for me would be a thing quite new.  
Truth is a thing that I will ever keep  
Unto that day, at last, when I shall creep  
Into my grave, or elsewise God forbid!  
Trust this as surely as you trust your creed.

I thank God, and in good time be it said,  
That there was never yet man ill repaid  
For gold or silver that to me he lent,  
Nor ever falsehood in my heart I meant.  
And, sir,” said he, “out of my privity,

Since you have been so very good to me,  
And showed to me so great a nobleness,  
Somewhat to quit you for your kindliness,  
I’ll show to you, and if you’d learn it here,  
I’ll teach you plainly all the methods dear  
I use in working at philosophy.  
Give it good heed, for you’ll see with your eye  
I’ll do a masterpiece before I go.”

“Yes?” asked the priest, “Yes, sir, and will you so?  
Marry! Thereof I pray you heartily.”

“At your service, sir, and truthfully,”  
Replied the canon, “else, may God forbid!”

Service this thief could offer, and he did!

Full true it is that service in this guise  
Stinks, as take witness of these old men wise;  
And soon enough I will this verify  
By this canon, the root of treachery,  
Who always had delight, nor could refrain—  
Such devilish thoughts within his heart did reign—  
When he brought Christian folk to tribulation.  
God keep us from his false dissimulation!

Naught understood this priest with whom he dealt,  
And of his coming harm he nothing felt.

O hapless priest! O hapless innocent!  
Blinded by avarice malevolent!  
O luckless one, full blind is your conceit,  
Nothing are you aware of the deceit  
Which this sly fox arranges here to be;  
His wily stratagems you cannot flee.

Wherefore, at once to make the ending known,  
By which your troubles will be clearly shown,  
Unhappy man, I’ll hasten on to tell  
The folly into which you blindly fell,

And, too, the treachery of that other wretch,  
As far as what I know of him may stretch.

“This canon was my lord, you think I mean?  
Sir host, in faith, and by the Heaven’s Queen,  
It was another canon, and not he,  
Who has a hundred-fold more subtlety!  
He has betrayed the people many a time;  
Of his deceit it wearies me to rhyme.

Whatever of his falsehood I have said,  
For shame of him I feel my cheeks grow red;  
At any rate, my cheeks begin to glow.  
For redness have I none, right well I know,  
In all my visage; for the fumes diverse  
Of metals, whereof you’ve heard me rehearse,  
Have all consumed and wasted my redness.”

---

Now take heed of this canon’s cursednesse!

“Sir,” quod he to the priest, “let your man go  
For quicksilver, that we it had anon;  
And let him bringen ounces two or three;  
And when he cometh, as fast shall ye see  
A wonder thing, which ye saugh never er this.”

“Sir,” quod the priest, “it shall be done, y-wis.”  
He bade his servant fetch him this thing,  
And he all ready was at his bidding,  
And went him forth, and came anon again  
With this quicksilver, soothly for to sayn,  
And took these ounces three to the canon;  
And he them laid fair and well adown,  
And bade the servant coles for to bring,  
That he anon might go to his werking.

The coles right anon were fetched,  
and this canon took out a crosselet  
of his bosom, and shewed it the priest.

“This instrument,” quod he, “which that thou seest,  
Take in thine hand, and put thy-self therein  
Of this quicksilver an ounce, and here begin.  
In the name of Christ, to wax a philosopher.  
There been full few, which that I would proffer  
To shew them thus much of my science.  
For ye shall seen here, by experience,  
That this quicksilver will I mortify  
Right in your sight anon, withouten lie.”

All was then done as canon had decreed;  
This servant took himself straight out, indeed,  
Whereat his master barred the door anon,  
And to their labour quickly they were gone.

The priest, at this damned canon's ordering,  
Upon the fire anon did set this thing,  
And blew the fire and busied him full fast;  
Within the crucible the canon cast  
A powder (I know not whereof it was  
Compounded, whether of chalk, or maybe glass,  
Or something else — it was not worth a fly)  
To blind the priest with; and he bade him high  
The coals to pile the crucible above.

"In token of how much I bear you love,"  
This canon said, "your own two hands, and none  
Other, shall do this thing that shall be done."

"Thank you," the priest replied, and was right glad,  
And heaped the coals up as the canon bade.

And while he laboured thus, this fiendish wretch,  
This canon false — may him the foul Fiend fetch! —  
Out of his bosom took a beechen coal.

Wherein, right cunningly, he'd bored a hole  
In which, before, he'd put of silver limail  
An ounce, and which he'd stopped up, without fail,  
With blackened wax, to keep the filings in.

And understand you well that this false gin  
Was not made there, but it was made before;  
And there were other things I'll tell you more  
About hereafter, which with him he'd brought;  
Ere he came there, to cheat he'd taken thought,  
And ere they parted he did even so;  
Till he had skinned him he could not forgo.

It wearies me when of him I do speak,  
For on his falsehood I myself would wreak,  
If I knew how; but he is here and there:  
He is so restless he abides nowhere.

But take heed now, sirs, for God's very love!  
He took this coal whereof I spoke above,  
And in his hand he bore it privily.

And while the priest did pile up busily  
The burning coals, as I told you ere this,  
This canon said: "My friend, you do amiss;  
This is not piled up as it ought to be;  
But soon I shall amend all that," said he.  
"Now let me thereof have a hand the while,  
For I've great pity on you, by Saint Giles!  
You are right hot, I see well how you sweat,  
Take here a cloth and wipe away the wet."

And while the simple priest did wipe his face,  
This canon took his coal, and with grave grace,  
Laid it above and well to middle ward  
Upon the crucible, and blew it hard  
Until the flames did blaze up hot again.

"Now give us drink, sir," said the canon then,  
"For soon all shall be well, I undertake;  
Let us sit down, and let us merry make."

And when this treacherous canon's beechen coal  
Was burnt, then all the filings from the hole  
Into the crucible fell down anon;  
As so, in reason, it must needs have done,  
Since so well centred over it it was;  
But thereof nothing knew the priest, alas!  
He deemed that all the coals alike were good,  
For of the trick he nothing understood.

And when this alchemist was ready, he  
Said to the priest: "Rise up and stand by me;  
And since I know that mould for ingots you've none,  
Go, sally forth, and bring here a chalk-stone;  
For I will make one of the very shape  
That ingot moulds have, if I can them ape.  
And, too, bring in with you a bowl or pan  
Full of clear water, and you'll see, dear man,  
I trow well our business here shall thrive, in brief.  
And yet, that you may have no unbelief,  
Or think that somehow I'm not doing right,  
I'll never be a moment out of sight,  
But go with you and come with you again."

The chamber door, then, shortly to explain,  
They opened and they shut, and went their way.  
And as they went they took the key, I say,  
And came again, without a long delay.

Why should I tarry here the livelong day?  
He took the chalk and shaped it in such wise  
As moulds are made, as further I'll apprise.

I say, he took, then, out of his own sleeve  
A tain of silver (Hell the man receive!)  
Which was an ounce, no more or less, in weight;  
Now here's the trick, the way of which I'll state!

He shaped his mould in length and breadth to be  
Like to the tain of silver, as you see,  
So slyly that the priest this never spied;  
And in his sleeve did then the model hide;  
And from the fire he took his crucible  
And poured it in the mould, for all went well,  
And in the bowl of water then did cast  
The mould and all, and bade the priest, at last:

> "Seek what there is, put in your hand and grope,  
> And you shall find there silver, as I hope;  
> What — devils out of Hell! — should it else be?  
> Filing of silver silver is!" cried he.

He put his hand in and a tain took out  
Of silver fine, and glad, you cannot doubt,  
Was this priest when he saw that it was so.

"God's blessing, and His Mother's dear also,  
And all the saints', too, may you have, my friend,"  
The priest replied, "and may they curse my end  
Unless you will vouchsafe to teach to me  
This noble craft and all this subtlety;  
I will be yours in all that ever I may!"

Said then the canon: "Yet will I assay  
A second time, that you may take good heed  
And be expert in this, and at your need,  
When I am absent on another day,  
You may this science and its arts assay.

Quicksilver take, said he, one ounce, no more,  
As you'll remember that we did before,  
And as you treated that, so do with this  
And like the first 'twill change, which silver is."

The priest then followed carefully the plan,  
As he'd been bidden by this cursed man,  
The canon; long and hard he blew the fire  
To bring about the thing he did desire.

And this said canon waited all the while,  
All ready there the poor priest to beguile,  
And, for assurance, in his hand did bear  
A hollow stick (take heed, sirs, and beware!),  
In end of which an ounce was, and no more,  
Of silver filings put, all as before  
Within the coal, and stopped with wax, a bit,  
To keep the filings in the hole of it.

And while the priest was busy, as I say,  
This canon, drawing close, got in his way,  
And unobserved he threw the powder in  
Just as before (the Devil from his skin  
Strip him, I pray to God, for lies he wrought;  
For he was ever false in deed and thought);

And with his stick, above the crucible,  
Arranged for knavish trickery so well,  
He stirred the coals until to melt began  
The thin wax in the fire, as every man,  
Except a fool, knows well it must, sans doubt,  
And all that was within the stick slipped out,  
And quickly in the crucible it fell.

Good sirs, what better do you wish than well?  
When now the priest was thus beguiled again,  
Supposing naught but truth, sooth to say,  
He was so glad, that I can not express  
In no manner his mirth and his gladness;  
And to the canon he proffered eftsoon  
Body and goods. "Yea," was the canon's tune,  
"Though poor I be, crafty thou shalt me find;  
I warn thee, yet is there more behind.

Is there any copper here?" asked he.  
"Yea," said the priest, "sir, I trow well there be."  
"Then go buy us some, and that as swiftly,  
Now, good sir, go forth thy way and hie thee."  

He went his way, and with the copper came,  
And this canon it in his hands took,  
And of that copper weighed out but an ounce.

All too simple is my tongue to pronounce,  
As minister of my wit, the doubleness  
Of this canon, root of all cursedness.

He seemed friendly to them that knew him not,  
But he was fiendly both in heart and thought.  
It wearies me to tell of his falseness.  
And nevertheless yet will I it express  
To the intent that men may be warned thereby,  
And for no other cause, truly.

He put his ounce of copper in the crucible,  
And on the fire as swiftly he had set.  
And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,  
And in his working for to stoop low;  
As he did ere, and all was but a jape;  
Right as him listed, the priest he made his ape;  
And afterward in the ingot he it cast,  
And in the pan put it at the last  
Of water, and in he put his own hand.

And in his sieve (as you before-hand heard me tell)  
He had a silver tain. He slyly took it out,  
This cursed knave — unwitting this priest of his false craft —  
And in the pan's bottom he had it left;  
And in the water groped he to and fro,  
And wondrous privily took up also  
The copper tain, naught knowing this priest.  
And hid it, and him caught by the breast.  
And to him spoke, and thus said in his game:

> "Stooped lower down, by God, you are to blame,  
> Come, help me now, as I did you whilere,  
> Put in your hand and search and learn what's there."

This priest took up the silver tain anon.  
And then said the canon, "Let us be gone  
With these three plates which we have thus wrought,  
To some goldsmith, to learn if they're worth aught.  
For by my faith, I wouldn't, for my hood,  
Have them, save they are silver fine and good,  
And that immediately proved shall be."

Unto the goldsmith with these tains three  
They went, and put the metal in assay  
By fire and hammer; no man could say nay.  
And they were silver, as they ought to be.

This foolish priest, who was more glad than he?  
Never was bird gladder at the dawn of day,  
Nor nightingale in season of the May,  
Nor was there ever one more fain to sing;  
Nor lady happier in carolling,  
Or speaking much of love and woman's meed;  
Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed  
To stand in graces of his lady dear —  
Than was this priest this sorry craft to hear;  
And to the canon thus he spoke and said:

> "For love of God, Who for us all was dead,  
> And as I may requite it unto you,  
> What shall this recipe cost? Come, tell me now!"

"By our Lady," said this canon, "it is dear,  
I warn you well; for now in England here  
One friar and I are all who can it make."

"No matter," said he, "now, sir, for God's sake,  
What shall I pay? Oh, tell me this, I pray!"

"Truly," said he, "it is right dear, I say;  
Sir, in one word, if this thing you will have,  
You shall pay forty pounds, so God me save!  
And were it not for friendship shown ere this  
To me, you should pay more than that, ywis."

This priest the sum of forty pounds anon  
In nobles fetched, and gave them every one  
To this said canon for this said receipt;  
His business was all fraud and all deceit.

"Sir priest," he said, "I do not care to lose  
My secret craft, and I would 'twere kept close;  
So, as you love me, keep it privily;  
For if men knew all of my subtlety,  
By God above, they'd have so great envy  
Of me, because of my philosophy,  
I should be slain; there'd be no other way."

"Nay, God forbid!" replied the priest. "What say?  
Far rather would I spend all coin, by God,  
That I possess (and else may I grow mad!)  
Than that you fall in any such distress."

"For your goodwill, I wish you all success,"  
Replied the canon. "Farewell, many thanks."  
He went, and ne'er the priest this mountebank's  
Face saw thereafter; and when this priest would  
Make his own test, at such time as he could,  
Of this receipt, farewell! it would not be!  
Lo, thus bejaped and thus beguiled was he!  
And thus he had his introduction in  
The way men fall to ruin and to sin.

Consider, sirs, how that, in each estate,  
Between men and their gold there is debate  
To such degree that gold is nearly done.  
This multiplying blinds so many a one  
That in good faith I think that it may be  
The greatest cause of this said scarcity.

Philosophers they speak so mistily  
About this craft, plain men can't come thereby  
With any wit that men have nowadays.  
They may well chatter, as do all these jays,  
And in vague cant set their desire and pain.  
But to their purpose shall they ne'er attain.

A man may easily learn, if he have aught,  
To multiply, and bring his wealth to naught.  
Lo, such a gain is in this pleasant game  
A man's mirth it will turn to grief and shame,  
And it will empty great and heavy purses,  
And causes alchemists to get the curses  
Of all of those who thereunto have lent.

O fie! For shame! Those who the fire resent,  
Alas! can they not flee the fire's fierce heat?  
If you have tried it, leave it, I repeat,  
Lest you lose all; better late than never.  
And though you prowl, you never gold shall find;  
You are as bold as Bayard is, the blind,  
That blunders forth and thinks of danger none;  
He is as bold to run against a stone  
As to go ambling down the broad highway.  
And so fare you who multiply, I say.

If your two fleshly eyes can't see aright,  
Look to it that your mind lack not for sight.  
For, though you look about and though you stare,  
You shall not win a mite in traffic there,  
But you shall waste all you may scrape and turn.  
Avoid that fire, lest much too fast it burn;  
Meddle no more with that base art, I mean,  
For if you do, you'll lose your savings clean.

And now I'll tell you briefly, if I may,  
What the philosophers about this say.  
Arnold of Villanova I will cite.  
In his *Rosarium* he brings to light  
These facts, and says — in this I do not lie:

"No man can mercury ever mortify,  
Unless its brother's aid to it he bring,  
And also he who first did say this thing  
Was father of philosophers, Hermes;  
He said the dragon, doubtless, takes his ease  
And never dies, unless there's also slain  
His brother, which, to make the matter plain,  
Means, by the dragon, mercury, none other,  
And brimstone's understood to mean the brother,  
That out of Sol and Luna we can draw.

And therefore," said he, "give heed to my saw.  
Let no man busy him ever with this art  
Unless philosophers to him impart  
Their meaning clearly, for unless he can  
Their language grasp, he's but an ignorant man.  
This science and this learning, too," said he,  
"Must ever the most secret secrets be."

And make it as good silver and as fyn  
As ther is any in your purs or myn.  
Or elleswhere, and make it malliable;  
And elles, holdeth me fals and unable  
Amonges folk for ever to appere!

I have a poudre heer, that coste me dere,  
Shal make al good, for it is cause of al  
My conning, which that I yow shewen shal.  
Voydeth your man, and lat him be theroute.  
And shet the dore, whyls we been aboute  
Our privetee, that no man us espye  
Whyls that we werke in this philosophie.

Al as he bad, fulfilled was in dede,  
This ilke servant anon-right out yede,  
And his maister shette the dore anon,  
And to hir labour speedily they gon.

This preest, at this cursed chanouns bidding,  
Up-on the fyr anon sette this thing,  
And blew the fyr, and bisied him ful faste;  
And this chanoun in-to the croslet caste  
A poudre, noot I wher-of that it was  
Y-made, other of chalk, other of glas,  
Or somwhat elles, was nat worth a flye  
To blynde with the preest; and bad him hye  
The coles for to couchen al above  
The croslet; "for, in tokening I thee love,"  
Quod this chanoun, "thyn owene hondes two  
Shul werche al thing which that shal heer be do."  
"Graunt mercy," quod the preest, and was ful glad,  
And couched coles as the chanoun bad.

And whyle he bisy was, this feendly wrecche,  
This fals chanoun, the foule feend him fecche!  
Out of his bosom took a bechen cole,  
In which full subtilly he'd bored a hole,  
In which he put of silver limaille  
An ounce, and stopped was, withouten fayle,  
The hole with wex, to kepe the limail in.

And understondeth, that this false gin  
Was nat maad ther, but it was maad bifore;  
And othere thinges I shal telle more  
Herafterward, which that he with him broghte;  
Er he cam ther, him to bigyle he thoghte.  
And so he did, er that they wente a-twinne;  
Til he had terved him, coude he not blinne.

It dulleth me whan that I of him speke,  
On his falshede fayn wolde I me wreke,  
If I wiste how; but he is heer and ther:  
He is so variaunt, he abideth nowhere.

But taketh heed now, sirs, for Goddes love!  
He took his cole of which I spak above,  
And in his hond he baar it prively.

And whyls the preest couchede busily  
The coles, as I tolde yow er this,  
This chanoun seyde, "freend, ye doon amis;  
This is nat couched as it oghte be;  
But sonc I shal amenden it," quod he.  
"Now lat me medle therwith but a whyle.  
For of yow have I pitee, by seint Gyle!  
Ye been right hoot, I see wel how ye swete,  
Have heer a cloth, and wype awey the wete."

And whyles that the preest wyped his face,  
This chanoun took his cole with harde grace,  
And leyde it above, up-on the middeward  
Of the croslet, and blew wel afterward,  
Til that the coles gonne faste brenne.

"Now yeve us drinke," quod the chanoun thenne,  
"As swithe al shal be wel, I undertake;  
Sitte we doun, and lat us mery make."

And whan that this chanounes bechen cole  
Was brent, al the limaille, out of the hole,  
Into the croslet fil anon adoun;  
And so it moste nedes, by resoun,  
Sin it so even aboven couched was;  
But ther-of wiste the preest no-thing, alas!  
He demed alle the coles y-liche good,  
For of the sleighte he no-thing understood.

And whan this alkamistre saugh his tyme,  
"Rys up," quod he, "sir preest, and stondeth by me;  
And for I woot wel ingot have ye noon,  
Goth, walketh forth, and bring us a chalkstoon;  
For I wol make oon of the same shap  
That is an ingot, if I may han hap.  
And bringeth eek with yow a bolle or a panne,  
Ful of water, and ye shul see wel thanne  
How that our bisinesse shal thryve and preve.

And yet, for ye shul han no misbileve  
Ne wrong conceit of me in your absence,  
I ne wol nat been out of your presence,  
But go with yow, and come with yow ageyn."

The chambre-dore, shortly for to seyn,  
They opened and shette, and wente hir wey.  
And forthwith hem they carieden the keye,  
And come agayn with-outen any delay.

What sholde I tarien al the longe day?  
He took the chalk, and shoop it in the wyse  
Of an ingot, as I shal yow devyse.

I seye, he took out of his owene sleeve  
A teyne of silver (yvele mote he cheve!)  
Which that ne was nat but an ounce of weight;  
And taketh heed now of his cursed sleighte!

He shoop his ingot, in lengthe and eek in brede,  
Of this teyne, with-outen any drede,  
So slyly, that the preest it nat espide;  
And in his sieve agayn he gan it hyde;  
And fro the fyr he took up his matere,  
And in the ingot putte it with mery chere.

And in the water-vessel he it caste  
Whan that him luste, and bad the preest as faste,  
"Look what ther is, put in thyn hand and grope,  
Thow finde shalt ther silver, as I hope;  
What, devel of helle! sholde it elles be?  
Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!"

He putte his hond in, and took up a teyne  
Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne  
Was this preest, whan he saugh that it was so.  
"Goddes blessing, and his modres also.  
And alle halwes have ye, sir chanoun,"  
Seyde this preest, "and I hir malisoun.

But, and ye vouchesauf to techen me  
This noble craft and this subtilitee,  
I wol be youre, in al that ever I may!"

Quod the chanoun, "yet wol I make assay  
The second tyme, that ye may taken hede  
And been expert of this, and in your nede  
Another day assaye in myn absence  
This disciplyne and this crafty science.

Lat take another ounce," quod he tho,  
"Of quik-silver, with-outen wordes mo,  
And do ther-with as ye han doon er this  
With that other, which that now silver is."

This preest him bisieth in al that he can  
To doon as this chanoun, this cursed man,  
Comanded him, and faste he blew the fyr,  
For to come to the effect of his desyr.

And this chanoun, right in the mene while,  
Al redy was, the preest eft to bitye.  
And, for a countenance, in his hande he bar  
An holwe stikke (tak keep and be war!)  
In the ende of which an ounce, and na-more,  
Of silver limaille put was, as bifore,  
Was in his cole, and stopped with wex weel  
For to kepe in his limail every deel.

And whyl this preest was in his bisinesse,  
This chanoun with his stikke gan him dresse  
To him anon, and his poudre caste in  
As he did er; (the devel out of his skin  
Him terve, I pray to God, for his falshede;  
For he was ever fals in thoght and dede);  
And with this stikke, above the croslet,  
That was ordeyned with that false get,  
He stired the coles, til relente gan  
The wex agayn the fyr, as every man  
Woot wel it moste nede; and al that in the stikke was  
Out yede, and quickly in the croslet it fel.

Now gode sirs, what wol ye bet than wel?  
Whan that this preest thus was bigyled ageyn,  
Supposing noght but trouthe, soth to seyn,  
He was so glad, that I can nat expresse  
In no manere his mirthe and his gladnesse;  
And to the chanoun he profred eftsone  
Body and good; "ye," quod the chanoun sone,  
"Though povre I be, crafty thou shalt me finde;  
I wame thee, yet is ther more bihinde.

Is ther any coper her-inne?" seyde he.  
"Ye," quod the preest, "sir, I trowe wel ther be."  
"Elies go bye us som, and that as swythe,  
Now, gode sir, go forth thy wey and hy the."

He wente his wey, and with the coper cam.  
And this chanoun it in his handes nam,  
And of that coper weyed out but an ounce.  
Al to simple is my tonge to pronounce,  
As ministre of my wit, the doublenesse  
Of this chanoun, rote of al cursednesse.

He semed freendly to hem that knewe him noght,  
But he was feendly bothe in herte and thoght.  
It werieth me to telle of his falsnesse,  
And nathelees yet wol I it expresse  
To th'entente that men may be war therby,  
And for noon other cause, trewely.

He putte his ounce of coper in the croslet,  
And on the fyr as swythe he hath it set,  
And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,  
And in his werking for to stoupe lowe,  
As he dide er, and al nas but a jape;  
Right as him liste, the preest he made his ape;  
And afterward in th'ingot he it caste,  
And in the panne putte it at the laste  
Of water, and in he putte his owene hond.

And in his sieve (as ye biforn-herd me telle)  
He hadde a silver teyne. He slyly took it oute,  
This cursed heyne — unwiting this preest of his false craft —  
And in the panne's botme he hadde it laft;  
And in the water rombled to and fro,  
And wonder prively took up also  
The coper teyne, noght knowing this preest,  
And hidde it, and him hente by the breest.

And to him spak, and thus seyde in his game,  
"Stoupeth adoun, by God, ye be to blame,  
Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whiler,  
Putte in your hand, and loketh what is ther."

This preest took up this silver teyne anon.  
And thanne seyde the chanoun, "lat us gon  
With thise three teynes, which that we han wroght,  
To som goldsmith, and wite if they been oght.  
For, by my feith, I nolde, for myn hood,  
But-if that they were silver, fyn and good.  
And that as swythe proved shal it be."

Un-to the goldsmith with thise teynes three  
They wente, and putte thise teynes in assay  
By fir and hamer; mighte no man seye nay;  
But that they weren as hem oghte be.

This sotted preest, who was gladder than he?  
Was never brid gladder agayn the day,  
Ne nightingale, in the sesoun of May,  
Nas never noon that luste bet to singe;  
Ne lady lustier in carolinge  
Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,  
Ne knight in armes to doon an hardy dede  
To stonde in grace of his lady dere,  
Than had this preest this sory craft to lere;  
And to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde:

"For love of God, that for us alle deyde,  
And as I may deserve it unto yow,  
What shal this receit coste? telleth now!"

"By our lady," quod this chanoun, "it is dere,  
I wame yow wel; for, save I and a frere,  
In Englond ther can no man it make."

"No fors," quod he, "now, sir, for goddes sake,  
What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye."

"Y-wis," quod he, "it is ful dere, I seye;  
Sir, at o word, if that thee list it have,  
Ye shul paye fourty pound, so God me save!  
And, nere the freendship that ye dide er this  
To me, ye sholde paye more, ywis."

This preest the somme of fourty pound anon  
Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon  
To this chanoun, for this ilke receit;  
Al his werking nas but fraude and deceit.

"Sir preest," he seyde, "I kepe han no loos  
Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were cloos;  
And as ye love me, kepeth it secree;  
For, and men knewe al my subtilitee,  
By God, they wolden han so greet envye  
To me, by-cause of my philosophye,  
I sholde be deed, ther were non other weye."

"God it forbede!" quod the preest, "what sey ye?"  
Yet hadde I lever spenden al the good  
Which that I have (and elles wexe I wood!)  
Than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef."

"For your good wil, sir, have ye right good preef,"  
Quod the chanoun, "and far-wel, grant mercy!"

He wente his wey and never the preest him sy  
After that day; and whan that this preest sholde  
Maken assay, at swich tyme as he wolde,  
Of this receit, far-wel! it wolde nat be!  
Lo, thus byjaped and bigyled was he!  
Thus maketh he his introduccioun  
To bringe folk to hir destruccioun. —

Considereth, sirs, how that, in ech estaat,  
Bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat  
So ferforth, that unnethes is ther noon.  
This multiplying blent so many oon,  
That in good feith I trowe that it be  
The cause grettest of swich scarsetee.

Philosophres speken so mistily  
In this craft, that men can nat come therby,  
For any wit that men han now a-dayes.  
They mowe wel chiteren, as doon thise jayes,  
And in her termes sette hir lust and peyne;  
But to their purpose shall they never atteyne.

A man may lightly lerne, if he have aught,  
To multiply, and bringe his welth to nought.  
Lo, such a geyn is in this plesant game,  
A mannes mirthe it wole chaunge into blame,  
And it wole empty grete and hevy purses,  
And causeth alchemis to have the curses  
Of alle that to this art have lent.

O fie! For shame! that they the fier entende,  
Ne can they flee the fier's hete that brenneth?  
If thou hast tried it, leave it, I thee rede,  
Lest that thou lose al; better late than nede.  
And though thou prowle, thou shalt no gold fynde,  
Thou art as bold as Bayard is, the blynde,  
That blundereth forth and nought of perile woot;  
He is as bold to renne upon a stoon  
As for to go ambling on a broad wei.

And so fare ye that multiply, I say.  
If your eyen fleshly sowle nat see aright,  
Looke that your wit be not want of sight.  
For though you looke aboute and though you stare,  
Ye shal noc hir a mite in trafic there,  
But ye shal wast al that ye have for to turne.  
Avoyde that fier, lest ye it do to burne.

Meddle no more with that base craft, I mene,  
For if ye do, ye shal the gouernance clene  
Of your propre goodes, and alle that ye have.  
And now for breuete, if that I may,  
I will you tell what philosophie seith the same.

Arnold of Villanovana I wyll cite,  
In his *Rosarium* he bringeth to the light  
These words, and seith — in this I do not lye:  
"No man may mercury mortifye,  
Unless his brother's help he bring thereto,  
And hym that first it seide was Hermes tho.  
He seith the dragon, toke his reste, ne doth nat dye,  
But if his brother be yslayn also;  
By the dragon he meaneth mercurie,  
And by the brother he meaneth brimston, ye see,  
That out of Sol and Luna we maye drawe.  
And therefore," sayth he, "I rede you lawe,  
Let no man busie hym himself with this arte  
But if philosophers do hym parte  
Of hir sentence, for elles he shal nat can  
The meaning, for he is but an ignorant man.  
This science and this craft, bitide me so,  
Moste be allwayes secret and privily ydo."

## THE MANCIPLE'S PROLOGUE

### Modern English (cleaned)

Do you not know where stands a little town  
That’s called by all about Bob-up-and-down,  
Under the Blean, down Canterbury way?  
There did our host begin to jape and play,  
And he said: “Sirs, what! Dun is in the mire!  
Is there no man, then, who, for prayer or hire,  
Will wake our comrade who’s so far behind?  
A thief might easily rob him and bind.  
See how he’s nodding! See, now, by Cock’s bones,  
As if he’d fall down from his horse at once.  
Is that a cook of London, with mischance?  
Make him come forward, he knows his penance;  
For he shall tell a tale here, by my fay,  
Although it be not worth a bunch of hay.  
‘Awake, you cook,’ cried he, ‘God give you sorrow!  
What ails you that you sleep thus? It’s good morrow!  
Have you had fleas all night, or are you drunk?  
Or did you toil all night in some quean’s bunk,  
So that you cannot now hold up your head?’”

The cook, who was all pale and nothing red,  
Said to our host: “So may God my soul bless,  
As there is on me such a drowsiness,  
I know not why, that I would rather sleep  
Than drink a gallon of best wine in Cheap.”

“Well,” said the manciple, “if ’twill give ease  
To you, sir cook, and in no way displease  
The folk that ride here in this company,  
And if our host will, of his courtesy,  
I will, for now, excuse you from your tale.  
For, in good faith, your visage is full pale,  
Your eyes are bleary also, as I think,  
And I know well your breath right sour does stink,  
All of which shows that you are far from well;  
No flattering lies about you will I tell.  
See how he yawns. Just look, the drunken wight,  
As if he’d swallow all of us outright.  
Now close your mouth, man, by your father’s kin;  
Ah, may Hell’s devil set his foot therein!  
Your cursed breath will soon infect us all;  
Fie, stinking swine, fie! Evil you befall!  
Ah, take you heed, sirs, of this lusty man.  
Now, sweet sir, would you like to ride at fan?  
It seems to me you’re in the proper shape!  
You’ve drunk the wine that makes a man an ape,  
And that is when a man plays with a straw.”

The cook grew wroth, for this had touched the raw,  
And at the manciple he nodded fast  
For lack of speech, and down his horse he cast,  
And there he lay till up the rest him took,  
Which was a feat of riding for a cook!  
Alas! That he had kept not to his ladle!  
For ere he was again within his saddle,  
There was a mighty shoving to and fro  
To lift him up, and huge care and woe,  
So all unwieldy was this sorry ghost.

And to the manciple then spoke our host:  
“Since drink has got such utter domination  
Over this fellow here, by my salvation,  
I think that badly he would tell his tale.  
For, whether wine or old or musty ale  
Is what he’s drunk, he speaks all through his nose;  
He snorts hard and with cold he’s lachrymose.  
Also he has more than enough to do  
To keep him and his nag out of the slough;  
And if he fall down off his horse again,  
We’ll all have quite enough of labour then  
In lifting up his heavy drunken corse.  
Tell on your tale, he matters not, of course.

“Yet, manciple, in faith, you are not wise  
Thus openly to chide him for his vice.  
Some day he’ll get revenge, you may be sure,  
And call you like a falcon to the lure;  
I mean he'll speak of certain little things,  
As, say, to point out in your reckonings  
Things not quite honest, were they put to proof.”

“Nay,” said the manciple, “that were ill behoof!  
So might he easily catch me in his snare.  
Yet would I rather pay him for the mare  
Which he rides on than have him with me strive;  
I will not rouse his rage, so may I thrive!  
That which I said, I said as jesting word;  
And know you what? I have here, in a gourd,  
A draught of wine, yea, of a good ripe grape,  
And now anon you shall behold a jape.”

> A vane or quintain. To ride at fan (or at quintain) was to tilt at a board at one end of a pivoted crossbar, at the other end of which was suspended a sandbag. The object was to strike the board with the lance and to escape being hit by the sandbag.

Wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel toun  
Which that y-cleped is Bob-up-and-doun,  
Under the Blee, in Caunterbury weye?  
Ther gan our hoste for to jape and pleyen,  
And seyde, “Sirs, what! Dim is in the myre!  
Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre,  
That wol awake our felawe heer bihinde?  
A theef mighte him ful lightly robbe and binde.  
See how he nappeth! see, for cokkes bones,  
As he wol falle from his hors at ones.  
Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce?  
Do him come forth, he knoweth his penaunce.  
For he shal telle a tale, by my fey!  
Al-though it be nat worth a botel hey.  
‘Awake, thou cook,’ quod he, ‘God yeve thee sorwe,

Or hastow with som quene al night y-swonke,

This cook, that was ful pale and nothing reed,  
Seyde to our host, “So God my soule blesse,  
As ther is falle on me swich hevinesse,  
Noot I nat why, that me were lever slepe

“Wei,” quod the maunciple, “if it may doon ese

For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale,

Now swete sir, wol ye justen atte fan?  
Ther-to me thinketh ye been wel y-shape!  
I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,  
And that is whan men pleyen with a straw.”

And with this speche the cook wex wrooth and wraw,  
And on the maunciple he gan nodde faste  
For lakke of speche, and doun the hors him caste,  
Wher as he lay, til that men up him took;  
This was a fayr chivachee of a cook!  
Allas! he nadde holde him by his ladel!  
And er that he agayn were in his sadel,  
Ther was greet shoving bothe to and fro,  
To lifte him up, and muchel care and wo.  
So unweldy was this sory palled gost.

And to the maunciple thanne spak our host,  
“By-cause drink hath dominacioun  
Upon this man, by my savacioun,  
I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.  
For, were it wyn, or old or moisty ale,  
That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,  
And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.  
He hath also to do more than y-nough  
To kepe him and his capel out of slough;  
And if he falle from his capel eft-sone,  
Than shul we alle have y-nough to done,  
In lifting up his hevy dronken cors.  
Telle on thy tale, of him make I no fors.

“But yet, maunciple, in feith thou art to nyce  
Thus openly repreve him of his vyce.  
Another day he wol, peraventure,  
Reclayme thee, and bringe thee to lure;

## THE MANCIPLE'S TALE

### Prologue end / Transition

This cook shall drink thereof, sir, if I may;  
On pain of death he will not say me nay!”  
And certainly, to tell it as it was,  
Out of this gourd the cook drank deep, alas!  
What need had he? He’d drunk enough that morn,  
And when he had blown into this said horn,  
He gave the manciple the gourd again;  
And of that drink the cook was wondrous fain,  
And thanked him then in such wise as he could.  

Then did our host break into laughter loud,  
And said: “I see well it is necessary,  
Wher’er we go, good drink with us we carry;  
For that will turn rancour and all uncase  
To accord and love, and many a wrong appease.  
“O Bacchus, thou, all blessed be thy name,  
Who canst so turn stern earnest into game!  
Honour and thanks be to thy deity!  
Concerning which you’ll get no more from me.  
Tell on your tale, good manciple, I pray.”

“Well, sir,” said he, “now hear what I will say.”

### The Manciple's Tale (Modern English, cleaned)

Here beginneth the Manciple's Tale of the Crow

When Phoebus once on earth was dwelling, here,  
As in the ancient books it is made clear,  
He was the lustiest of bachelors  
In all this world, and even the best archer;  
He slew Python, the serpent, as he lay  
Sleeping within the sunlight, on a day;  
And many another noble, worthy deed  
He with his bow wrought, as all men may read.  

He played all instruments of minstrelsy,  
And sang so that it made great harmony  
To hear his clear voice in the joyous sun.  
Truly the king of Thebes, that Amphion  
Who, by his singing, walled that great city,  
Could never sing one half so well as he.  
Therewith he was the handsomest young man  
That is or was since first the world began.  
What needs it that his features I revive?  
For in the world was none so fair alive.  
Compact of honour and of nobleness,  
Perfect he was in every worthiness.

This Phoebus, of all youthful knights the flower,  
Whom generous chivalry did richly dower,  
For his amusement (sign of victory  
Over that Python, says the old story),  
Was wont to bear in hand a golden bow.  
Now Phoebus had within his house a crow,  
Which in a cage he’d fostered many a day,  
And taught to speak, as men may teach a jay.  
White was this crow as is a snow-white swan,  
And counterfeit the speech of any man  
He could, when he desired to tell a tale.  
Therewith, in all this world, no nightingale  
Could, by a hundred thousandth part, they tell,  
Carol and sing so merrily and well.

Now Phoebus had within his house a wife  
Whom he loved better than he loved his life,  
And night and day did ever his diligence  
Her for to please, and do her reverence,  
Save only, if the truth that I shall say,  
Jealous he was, and would have kept her fain;  
For him were loath to be by-japed to be.  
And so in every wight in such degree;  
But all in vain, for it availeth naught.  
A good wife, that is clean of work and thought,  
Should not be kept in any ward, certain;  
And truly, the labour is in vain  
To keep a shrew, for it will not remain.

This hold I for a very nicety,  
To spill labour, for to keep wives;  
Thus write old clerks in their lives.  
But now to purpose, as I first began:  
This worthy Phoebus dooth all that he can  
To please her, wening by such pleasance,  
And for his manhood and his governance,  
That no man should have put him from her grace.  
But God it wot, there may no man embrace

### HERE IS ENDED THE MANCIPLE'S TALE OF THE CROW

---

## THE PARSON’S PROLOGUE

By that the manciple had his tale all ended, the sun from the south line was descended so low that he was not, to my sight, nine and twenty degrees yet in height. It was four of the clock, or little more or less, for my shadow was at that time of the length I have shown, in six-foot equal parts.

Therewith the moon’s high exaltation, I mean the sign of Libra, did ascend as we were entering at a village-end; whereat our host, since he was wont to guide our jolly company, said in this wise: “Now, masters, every one, we lack no tales except a single one. My judgment is fulfilled and my decree; I think that we have heard from each degree. Almost fulfilled is all my ordinance: I pray to God to give him right good chance who tells to us this story pleasantly. Sir priest,” he asked, “can you a vicar be? Are you a parson? Tell truth, by your fay! Be what you will, break not our jolly play; for every man, save you, has told his tale. Unbuckle, show us what is in your mail; for truly, I think, judging by your cheer, you should knit up a mighty matter here. Tell us a fable now, by Cock’s dear bones!”

This parson then replied to him at once: “You'll get no foolish fable told by me; for Paul, when writing unto Timothy, reproves all those that veer from truthfulness and tell false fables and such wretchedness. Why should I sow chaff out of my own fist, when I may sow good wheat, if I but list? But if, I say, you something wish to hear in which the moral virtues will appear, and if you now will give me audience, I will right gladly, in Christ’s reverence, give you such lawful pleasure as I can.

But trust me, since I am a Southern man, I can’t romance with ‘rum, ram, ruf’ by letter, and, God knows, rhyme I hold but little better; but if you wish the truth made plain and straight, a pleasant tale in prose I will relate to weave our feast together at the end.

May Jesus, of His grace, the wit me send to show you, as we journey this last stage, the way of that most perfect pilgrimage to heavenly Jerusalem on high. And if you will vouchsafe, anon shall I begin my tale, concerning which I pray, choose what you will; I can no better say. Yet this my meditation is, I own, perhaps not free from errors to be shown by clerks, since I am not a learned man; I do but grasp the meaning as I can. Therefore, I do protest, I shall prepare to take what comes, and all correction bear.”

When he had spoken thus, we all agreed, for, as it seemed to us, ’twas right indeed to end with something virtuous in its sense, and so to give him time and audience. We bade our host that he to him convey the wish of all that he begin straightway. Our host, he had the very words for all. “Sir priest,” said he, “may good to you befall! Say what you wish, and we will gladly hear.”

And with that word he said in this manner — “Tell,” said he, “your meditation, but hasten you, the sun will be down; be fruitful, and that in little space, and to do well God send you His grace!”

And after that he added, for his ear: “Tell us,” he said, “your meditation grown, but pray make haste, the sun will soon be down; be fruitful, tell us in a little space, and to do well God send to you His grace!”

### HERE ENDETH THE PROEM

## THE PARSON'S TALE

Jer. 6:16 — "Statue super vias et videte et interrogate de viis antiquis quae sit via bona; et ambulate in ea et invenietis requiem animabus vestris."

1. Our sweet Lord God of Heaven, who will that no man perish, but would have all come unto the knowledge of Him and to the blissful life that is perdurable, admonishes us by the prophet Jeremiah, who saith in this wise: “Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths (that is to say, of old sentences) which is the good way; and walk in that way, and ye shall find refreshing for your souls,” etc. Many are the spiritual ways that lead folk to Our Lord Jesus Christ and to the realm of glory. Of which ways there is a full noble way and a full convenient one, which may not fail to man nor to woman that through sin hath misgone from the right way of the Heavenly Jerusalem; and this way is called Penitence, of which man should gladly hearken and enquire with all his heart; to wit, what Penitence is, and whence it is called Penitence, and in how many manners be the actions or workings of Penitence, and how many species there be of Penitence, and which things appertain and behoove to Penitence, and which things disturb Penitence.

2. Saint Ambrose saith that “Penitence is the plainning of man for the guilt that he hath done, and nevermore to do any thing for which he ought to plain.” And some doctor saith: “Penitence is the lamenting of man, that sorrows for his sin and punishes himself for he hath misdoon.” Penitence, with certain circumstances, is very repentance of a man that holds himself in sorrow and other pain for his guilt. And for he shall be very penitent, he shall first bewail the sins that he hath done, and steadfastly purpose in his heart to have shrift of mouth, and to do satisfaction, and never to do thing for which he ought more to bewail or to complain, and to continue in good works: or else his repentance may not avail. For as saith Saint Isidore: “He is a japer and a gabber, and no very repentant, that eftsoon does thing for which he ought to repent.” Weeping, and not to cease to do sin, may not avail. But nevertheless, men shall hope that every time that man falleth, be it never so often, that he may arise through Penitence, if he have grace: but certainly it is great doubt. For as Saint Gregory saith: “Unnethe ariseth he out of sin, that is charged with the charge of evil usage.” And therefore repentant folk, that cease to sin, and leave sin ere that sin leave them, Holy Church holdeth them sure of her salvation. And he that sinneth, and verily repenteth him in his last end, Holy Church yet hopeth his salvation, by the great mercy of Our Lord Jesus Christ, for his repentance; but take the sure way.

3. And now, since I have declared unto you what thing is Penitence, now shall ye understand that there be three actions of Penitence. The first action of Penitence is, that a man be baptized after that he hath sinned. Saint Augustine saith: “But he be penitent for his old sinful life, he may not begin the new clean life.” For certes, if he be baptized without penitence of his old guilt, he receiveth the mark of baptism, but not the grace nor the remission of his sins, till he have repentance very. Another defect is this, that men do deadly sin after that they have received baptism. The third defect is, that men fall in venial sins after their baptism, from day to day. Thereof saith Saint Augustine, that “penitence of good and humble folk is the penitence of every day.”

4. The species of Penitence are three. One of them is solemn, another is common, and the third is private. That penitence that is solemn is in two manners; as to be put out of holy church in Lent, for slaughter of children and such manner of thing. Another is when a man hath sinned openly, of which sin the fame is openly spoken in the country; and then holy church by judgment constrains him to do open penance. Common penance is that priests enjoin men commonly in certain cases; as for to go, peradventure, naked in pilgrimages, or barefoot. Private penance is that which men do always for private sins, of which we shrive us privately and receive private penance.

5. Now shall you understand what is befitting and necessary to very perfect Penitence. And this stands on three things: Contrition of heart, Confession of mouth, and Satisfaction. For which saith Saint John Chrysostom: “Penitence constraineth a man to accept benignly every pain that is enjoined him, with contrition of heart, and shrift of mouth, with satisfaction; and in working of all manner humility.” And this is fruitful Penitence against three things in which we wrath Our Lord Jesus Christ: that is to say, by sin, by delight in thinking, by recklessness in speaking, and by wicked sinful working. And against these wicked guilts is Penitence, that may be likened unto a tree.

6. The root of this tree is Contrition, that hideth him in the heart of him that is very repentant, right as the root of a tree hideth him in the earth. Of the root of Contrition springeth a stalk, that beareth branches and leaves of Confession, and fruit of Satisfaction. For which Christ saith in his gospel: “Do worthy fruit of Penitence”; for by this fruit may men know this tree, and not by the root that is hid in the heart of man, nor by the branches nor by the leaves of Confession. And therefore Our Lord Jesus Christ saith thus: “By the fruit of them ye shall know them.” Of this root eke springeth a seed of grace, the which seed is mother of surety, and this seed is eager and hot. The grace of this seed springeth of God, through...

# THE PARSON'S TALE

### 7.

remembrance of the day of dome and on the peynes of helle. Of this matere seith Salomon, that “in the drede of God man forleteth his sinne.” The hete of this seed is the love of God, and the desiring of the joye perdurable. This hete draweth the herte of a man to God, and dooth him hate his sinne. For soothly, ther is no-thing that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice, ne no-thing is to him more abhominable than thilke milk whan it is medled with other mete. Right so the sinful man that loveth his sinne, him semeth that it is to him most swete of any-thing; but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly our Lord Jesu Crist, and desireth the lif perdurable, ther nis to him no-thing more abhominable. For soothly, the lawe of God is the love of God; for which David the prophete seith: “I have loved thy lawe and hated wikkednesse and hate”; he that loveth God kepeth his lawe and his word. This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit, upon the avision of the king Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled him to do penaunce. Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receiven, and he that holdeth him in verray penaunce is blessed; after the sentence of Salomon.

In this Penitence or Contricion man shal understonde foure thinges, that is to seyn, what is Contricion: and whiche been the causes that moeven a man to Contricion: and how he sholde be contrit: and what Contricion availleth to the soule. Thanne is it thus: that Contricion is the verray sorwe that a man receiveth in his herte for his sinnes, with sad purpos to shryve him, and to do penaunce, and nevermore to do sinne. And this sorwe shal been in this manere, as seith seint Bernard: “it shal been hevy and grevous, and ful sharpe and poinant in herte.” First, for man hath agilt his lord and his creatour; and more sharpe and poinant, for he hath agilt his fader celestial; and yet more sharpe and poinant, for he hath wrathed and agilt him that boghte him; which with his precious blood hath delivered us fro the bondes of sinne, and fro the crueltee of the devel and fro the peynes of helle.

### 8.

The causes that oghte moeve a man to Contricion been six. First, a man shal remembre him of hise sinnes; but loke he that thilke remembrance ne be to him no delyt by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt. For Job seith: “sinful men doon werkes worthy of Confession.” And therfore seith Ezechie: “I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf, in bittemesse of myn herte.” And God seith in the Apocalips: “remembreth yow fro whennes that ye been falle”; for bifom that tyme that ye sinned, ye were the children of God, and limes of the regne of God; but for your sinne ye been woxen thral and foul, and membres of the feend, hate of aungels, sclaundre of holy chirche, and fode of the false serpent. Ye be perpetuel matere of the fyr of helle. And yet more foul and abhominable, for ye trespassen so ofte tyme, as doth the hound that returmeth to eten his spewing. And yet been ye fouler for your longe continuing in sinne and your sinful usage, for which ye be roten in your sinne, as a beest in his dong. Swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his sinne, and no delyt, as God seith by the prophete Ezechiel: “ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes, and they shuln displese yow.” Sothly, sinnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle.

The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of sinne is this: that, as seith Saint Peter, “who-so that doth sinne is thral of sinne”; and sinne put a man in greet thraldom. And therefore seith the prophete Ezechiel: “I wente sorweful in desdayn of myself.” And certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of sinne, and withdrawe him from that thraldom and vileinye. And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere. He seith thus: “though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it, yet wolde I have desdayn for to do sinne.” And the same Seneca also seith: “I am born to gretter thinges than to be thral to my body, or than for to maken of my body a thral.” Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body, than for to yeven his body to sinne. Al were it the fouleste churl, or the fouleste womman that liveth, and leest of value, yet is he thanne more foule and more in servitute. Evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth, the more is he thral, and more to God and to the world vile and abhominable. O gode God, wel oghte man have desdayn of sinne; sith that, through sinne, ther he was free, now is he maked bonde. And therefore seyth Seint Augustin: “If thou hast desdayn of thy servant, if he agilte or sinne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do sinne.” Take reward of thy value, that thou ne be to foul to thy-self. Allas! wel oghte they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles to sinne, and sore been ashamed of hem-self, that God of his endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of body, hele, beautee, prosperitee, and boghte hem fro the deeth with his herte blood, that they so unkindely, agayns his gentilesse, quyten him so vileinsly, to slaughtre of hir owene soules. O gode God, ye wommen that been of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon, that seith: “He likneth a fair womman, that is a fool of hir body, lyk to a ring of gold that were in the groyn of a sowe.” For right as a sowe wroteth in everich ordure, so wroteth she hir beautee in the stinking ordure of sinne.

### 9.

The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to Contricion, is drede of the day of dome, and of the horrible peynes of helle. For as seint Jerome seith: “At every tyme that me remembreth of the day of dome, I quake; for whan I ete or drinke, or what-so that I do, evere semeth me that the trompe sowneth in myn ere: riseth up, ye that been dede, and cometh to the jugement.” O gode God, muchel oghte a man to drede swich a jugement, “ther-as we shullen been alle,” as seint Poul seith, “bifom the sete of oure Lord Jesu Crist”; wher-as he shal make a general congregacion, wher-as no man may been absent. For certes, there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacion. And nat only that oure defautes shullen be juged, but eek that alle oure werkes shuln openly be knowe. And as seith Seint Bernard: “ther ne shal no pledinge availle, ne no sleighte; we shullen yeven rekeninge of everich ydel word.” Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceived ne corrupt. And why? For, certes, alle our thoghtes been discovered as to him; ne for preyere ne for mede he shal nat been corrupt. And therfore seith Salomon: “the wrathe of God ne wol nat spare no wight, for preyere ne for yifte”; and therfore, at the day of doom, ther nis noon hope to escape. Wherfore, as seith Seint Anselm: “ful greet angwissh shul the sinful folk have at that tyme; ther shal the steme and wrothe juge sitte above, and under him the horrible put of helle open to destroyen him that moot biknowen hise sinnes, whiche sinnes openly been shewed bifom God and bifom every creature. And on the left syde, mo develes than herte may bithinke, for to harie and drawe the sinful soules to the pyne of helle. And within the hertes of folk shal be the bytinge conscience, and withoute-forth shal be the world al brenninge. Whider shal thanne the wrecched sinful man flee to hyden him? Certes, he may nat hyden him; he moste come forth and shewen him.” For certes, as seith seint Jerome: “the erthe shal casten him out of him, and the see also; and the eyr also, that shal be ful of thonder-clappes and lightninges.” Now sothly, who-so wel remembreth him of thise thinges, I gesse that his sinne shal nat tume him into delyt, but to greet sorwe, for drede of the peyne of helle. And therfore seith Job to God: “suffre, Lord, that I may a while biwaille and wepe, er I go with-oute returning to the derke lond, covered with the derknesse of deeth; to the lond of misese and of derknesse, wher-as is the shadwe of deeth; wher-as ther is noon ordre or ordinance, but grisly drede that evere shal laste.” Lo, here may ye seen that Job preyde respyt a while, to biwepe and waille his trespas; for soothly oon day of respyt is bettre than al the tresor of the world. And for-as-muche as a man may acquiten him-self bifom God by penitence in this world, and nat by tresor, therfore sholde he preye to God to yeve him respyt a while, to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas. For certes, al the sorwe that a man mighte make fro the beginning of the world, nis but a litel thing at regard of the sorwe of helle. The cause why that Job clepeth helle “the lond of derknesse”; understondeth that he clepeth it “londe” or “erthe,” for it is stable, and nevere shal faille; “derk,” for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material. For certes, the derke light, that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne, shal tume him al to peyne that is in helle; for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that him tormenten. “Covered with the derknesse of deeth”: that is to seyn, that he that is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of God; for certes, the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable. “The derknesse of deeth” been the sinnes that the wrecchced man hath doon, whiche that destourben him to se the face of God; right as doth a derk cloude bitwixe us and the sonne. “Lond of misconfort” (or “lond of yvel ease”): bycause that ther been three maneres of defautes, agayn three thinges that folk of this world han in this present lyf, that is to seyn, honours, delices, and richesses. Agayns honour have they in helle shame and confusion. For wel ye woot that men clepen “honour” the reverence that man doth to man; but in helle is noon honour ne reverence. For certes, na more reverence shal be doon there to a king than to a knave. For which God seith by the prophete Jeremy: “Thilke folk that me despysen shul been in despit.” “Honour” is eek cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no man serven other but of harm and torment. “Honour” is eek cleped greet dignitee and heighnesse; but in helle shullen they been al fortroden of develes. And God seith: “The horrible develes shulle goon and comen upon the hevedes of the dampned folk.” And this is, for-as-muche as the higher that they were in this present lyf, the more shullen they been abated and defouled in helle. Agayns the riches of this world shul they han misese of poverte; and this poverte shal been in foure thinges: in defaute of tresor; of which David seith: “The riche folk, that embraceden and oneden al hir herte to tresor of this world, shul slepe in the slepinge of deeth; and no-thing ne shul they finden in hir handes of al hir tresor.” And more-over, the misese of helle shal been in defaute of mete and drinke. For God seith thus by Moyses: “They shul been wasted with hunger, and the brid of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth, and the galle of the dragon shal been hir drinke, and the venim of the dragon hir morsels.” And forther-over, hir miseise shal been in defaute of clothing: for they shullen be naked in body as of clothing, save the fyr in which they brenne and other filthes; and naked shul they been of soule, of alle manere vertues, which that is the clothing of the soule. Where been thanne the gaye robes and the softe shetes and the smale shertes? Lo, what seith God of hem by the prophete Isaye: “That under hem shul been strawed motthes, and hir covertures shullen been of wormes of helle.” And forther-over, hir miseise shal been in defaute of freendes; for he nis nat povre that hath goode freendes, but there is no freend; for neither God ne no creature shal been freend to hem, and everich of hem shal haten other with deedly hate. “The sones and the doughtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder, and kinrede agayns kinrede, and chyden and despysen everich of hem other,” bothe day and night, as God seith by the prophete Michias. And the lovinge children, that whilom loveden so fleshly everich other, wolden everich of hem eten other if they mighte. For how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle, whan they hated ech of hem other in the prosperitee of this lyf? For truste wel, hir fleshly love was deedly hate; as seith the prophete David: “Who-so that loveth wickednesse he hateth his soule.” And who-so hateth his owene soule, certes, he may love noon other wight in no manere. And therfore, in helle is no solas ne no frendshipe, but evere the more fleshly kinredes that been in helle, the more cursinges, the more chydinges, and the more deedly hate ther is among hem. And forther-over, they shul have defaute of alle manere delices; for certes, delices been after the appetites of the five wittes, as sighte, heringe, smellinge, savoringe, and touchinge. But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse and of smoke, and therfore ful of teres; and hir hering, ful of waymentinge and of grintinge of teeth, as seith Jesu Crist; hir nosethirles shullen be ful of stinkinge stink. And as seith Isaye the prophete: “Hir savoring shal be ful of bitter galle.” And touchinge of al hir body, y-covered with “fyr that nevere shal quenche, and with wormes that nevere shul dyen,” as God seith by the mouth of Isaye. And for-as-muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne, and by hir deeth flee fro peyne, that may they understonden by the word of Job, that seith: “Ther-as is the shadwe of deeth.” Certes,

## Modernized Version

### 7.

Remembrance of the day of doom and of the pains of Hell. Of this matter says Solomon that “in the fear of God man forsaketh his sin.” The heat of this seed is the love of God and the desiring of the joy everlasting. This heat draws the heart of man unto God and causes him to hate his sin. For truly there is nothing that tastes so well to a child as the milk of its nurse, nor is there anything more abhorrent to it than that same milk when it is mingled with other food. Just so, the sinful man who loves his sin thinks that it is to him the sweetest of anything; but from that time that he loves devoutly Our Lord Jesus Christ and desires the life everlasting, there is to him nothing more abominable. For truly the law of God is the love of God; whereof David the prophet says: “Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.” He that loves God keeps His law and His word. The prophet Daniel saw this tree in spirit upon the vision of King Nebuchadnezzar when he counselled him to do penance. Penance is the tree of life to those who receive it, and he that holds himself in true penitence is blessed, according to the sentence of Solomon.

In this penitence or contrition man shall understand four things, that is to say, what contrition is; and what the causes are that move a man to contrition; and how he should be contrite; and what contrition avails to the soul. Then it is thus: that contrition is the true sorrow that a man receives in his heart for his sins, with a sad purpose to confess them, and to do penance, and nevermore to do sin. And this sorrow shall be in this manner, as Saint Bernard says: “It shall be heavy and grievous and sharp and poignant in the heart.” First, because man has offended his Lord and his Creator; and more sharp and poignant because he has offended his Heavenly Father; and yet more sharp and poignant because he has angered and offended Him Who redeemed him, Who with His precious blood has delivered us from the bonds of sin and from the cruelty of the Devil and from the pains of Hell.

### 8.

The causes that ought to move a man to contrition are six. First, a man should remember his sins; yet see to it that this remembrance be not to him in any wise a delight, but only great shame and sorrow for his guilt. For Job says that sinful men do works worthy of confession. And therefore Hezekiah says: “I will remember all the years of my life in bitterness of heart.” And God says in the Apocalypse: “Remember from whence thou art fallen.” For before that time when first you sinned, you were the children of God and members of the Kingdom of God; but because of your sin you are become slavish and vile, and the children of the Fiend, hated of angels, the slander of the Holy Church, and food of the false serpent. You are perpetual material for the fire of Hell. And yet more foul and abominable, for you trespass so often, as doth the hound that returns to eat his vomit. And yet are ye fouler for your long continuance in sin and your sinful usage, for which ye be rotten in your sin, as a beast in his dung. Such thoughts cause a man to have shame of his sin, and no delight, as God says by the prophet Ezekiel: “Thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed.” Truly, sins are the ways that lead folk unto Hell.

The second cause that ought to make a man have disdain of sin is this: that, as Saint Peter says, “Whosoever sins is a slave of sin,” and sin puts a man in great thraldom. And therefore the prophet Ezekiel says: “I went sorrowful, in abhorrence of myself.” And certainly well ought a man have disdain of sin, and withdraw him from that thraldom and vileness. And lo, what Seneca says in this matter. He says thus: “Though I knew that neither God nor man should ever be cognizant of it, yet would I disdain to commit a sin.” And the same Seneca also says: “I am born to greater things than to be thrall to my body, or than to make of my body a thrall.” Nor a viler thrall may man or woman make of his or her body than by giving that body over to sin. Albeit it were the foulest churl, or the foulest woman that liveth, and least of value, yet is he then more foul and more in servitude. Ever from the higher degree that man falls, the more is he enthralled, and by so much the more to God and to the world is he vile and abominable. O good God! Well ought man have disdain of sin; since by sin, where he was free, now is he made bond. And therefore Saint Augustine says: “If thou hast disdain for thy servant, if he offend or sin, have thou then disdain that thou thyself shouldest do sin.” Regard thy worth, that thou be not foul to thyself. Alas! Well ought they then to have disdain to be servants and thralls to sin, and sore be ashamed of themselves, that God of His endless goodness has set them in high estate, or given them wit, bodily strength, health, beauty, prosperity, and redeemed them with His heart’s blood, that they so unkindly, against His gentleness, requite Him so vilely, to the slaughter of their own souls. O good God! Ye women that are of so great beauty, remember the proverb of Solomon, who says: “He likens a fair woman that is a fool of her body to a gold ring that were in the groin of a sow.” For just as a sow roots in every ordure, so she roots her beauty in the stinking ordure of sin.

### 9.

The third cause that ought to move a man to contrition is fear of the day of doom and of the horrible pains of Hell. For as Saint Jerome says: “At every time that I remember the day of doom I quake; for when I eat or drink, or whatsoever I do, it ever seems to me that the trumpet sounds in mine ear: Rise up, ye dead, and come to judgment.” O good God! Greatly ought man to fear such a judgment, “where we shall be all,” as Saint Paul says, “before the throne of Our Lord Jesus Christ”; where He shall make a general congregation, where no man may be absent. For certainly there shall avail neither essoin nor excuse. And not only shall our defaults be judged, but also all our works shall openly be known. And as Saint Bernard says: “There shall no pleading avail, neither any sleight; we shall give reckoning of every idle word.” There shall we have a Judge that may not be deceived nor corrupted. And why? For, certainly, all our thoughts are discovered to Him; nor for prayer nor for bribe shall He be corrupted. And therefore Solomon says: “The wrath of God will spare no one, neither for prayer nor for gift.” Therefore, at the day of doom, there is no hope to escape. Wherefore, as Saint Anselm says: “Great anguish shall sinful folk have at that time; there shall the stern and angry Judge sit above, and under Him the horrible pit of Hell, open to destroy him that must confess his sins, which sins shall be openly showed before God and before every creature. And on the left side, more devils than heart may bethink, to harry and draw the sinful souls to the pain of Hell. And within the hearts of folk shall be the biting conscience, and without shall be the world all burning. Whither shall then the wretched sinful man flee to hide him? Certes, he may not hide; he must come forth and show himself.” For certainly, as Saint Jerome says: “The earth shall cast him out of him, and the sea also; and the air also, that shall be full of thunder-claps and lightnings.” Now truly, whoso well remembers these things, I guess that his sin shall not turn him into delight, but to great sorrow, for dread of the pain of Hell. And therefore Job said to God: “Suffer, Lord, that I may a while bewail and weep, ere I go without returning to the dark land, covered with the darkness of death; to the land of misery and of darkness, where is the shadow of death; where there is no order nor ordinance, but grisly dread that ever shall last.” Lo, here may ye see that Job prayed respite a while, to bewail and weep his trespass; for truly one day of respite is better than all the treasures of the world. And forasmuch as a man may acquit himself before God by penitence in this world, and not by treasure, therefore should he pray to God to give him respite a while, to weep and to bewail his trespasses. For certainly all the sorrow that a man might make from the beginning of the world is but a little thing in regard of the sorrow of Hell.

The reason why Job called Hell “the land of darkness” is to be understood thus: he called it “land” or “earth” because it is stable and never shall fail; “dark” because he that is in Hell lacks material light. For certainly the dark light that shall come out of the fire that ever shall burn shall turn him all to pain that is in Hell; for it shows him unto the horrible devils that torment him. “Covered with the darkness of death”: that is to say, he that is in Hell shall lack the sight of God; for truly the sight of God is life everlasting. “The darkness of death” are the sins that the wretched man hath done, which hinder him from seeing the face of God, even as a dark cloud comes between us and the sun. “Land of misery”: because there are three manners of defects against three things that folk of this world have in this present life, that is to say, honours, delights, and riches. Against honour they shall have in Hell shame and confusion. For well ye know that men call “honour” the reverence that one man gives to another; but in Hell there is no honour nor reverence. For certainly no more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave. Whereof God says by the prophet Jeremiah: “They that scorn me shall be scorned.” “Honour” is also called great lordship; there no man shall serve another save to his harm and torment. “Honour” is also called great dignity and high estate; but in Hell they shall be trodden upon by devils. And God says: “The horrible devils shall go and come upon the heads of the damned.” And this is because the higher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be abased and defiled in Hell.

Against the riches of this world shall they have the misery of poverty; and this poverty shall be of four kinds: lack of treasure, of which David says: “The rich that trusted in their wealth and set their heart upon the treasure of this world shall sleep in the sleep of death, and shall find nothing in their hands of all their treasure.” Moreover the misery of Hell shall be in lack of food and drink. For God says through Moses: “They shall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of Hell shall devour them with bitter death; the gall of the dragon shall be their drink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels.” Furthermore, their misery shall be for lack of clothing; for they shall be naked in body, except for the fire wherein they burn and other filths; and naked shall they be of soul, devoid of all manner of virtues, which are the clothing of the soul. Where shall then be the gay robes and the soft sheets and the fine shirts? Behold what God says by the prophet Isaiah: “Under them shall be strewn moths and their coverings shall be of the worms of Hell.” Furthermore their misery shall be in lack of friends; for he is not poor who has good friends; but there there is no friend; for neither God nor any creature shall be friend to them, and each of them shall hate the other with deadly hate. “The sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and mother, and kindred against kindred, and each shall curse and despise the others,” both day and night, as God says by the prophet Micah. And loving people who once loved one another so fleshly would each of them eat the other if he might. For how should they love together in the pains of Hell when they hated each other in the prosperity of this life? For trust well that their carnal love was deadly hate; as the prophet David says: “Whoever loveth wickedness hateth his own soul.” And whoever hateth his own soul, certainly he may love no other in any wise. Therefore in Hell there is no solace nor friendship; but the more fleshly kinships that are in Hell, the more cursings, more chidings, and more deadly hate there is among them. Furthermore they shall have lack of all manner of delights; for delights are after the appetites of the five wits—sight, hearing, smelling, savoring, and touch. But in Hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of smoke, and therefore full of tears; and their hearing full of lamentation and of the grinding of teeth, as Jesus Christ says; their nostrils shall be full of stench. And as Isaiah the prophet says: “Their savor shall be full of bitter gall.” And the touching of all their body covered with “fire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall die,” as God says by the mouth of Isaiah. And because they shall not suppose that they may die for pain and by their death flee from pain, that may they understand by the word of Job, who says: “There is the shadow of death.” Certes,

# THE PARSON’S TALE

Certainly a shadow has the likeness of the thing of which it is a shadow, but the shadow is not the same thing which it represents. Just so it is with the pain of Hell; it is like unto death because of the horrible anguish. And why? Because it pains forever, and as if they should die at every moment; but indeed they shall not die. For as Saint Gregory says: “To these wretched captives shall be given death without death, and end without end, and want without ceasing.”

And thereupon says Saint John the Evangelist:

> “They shall seek death, and they shall not find it; and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.”

And Job also says: that “in hell is no order of rule.” And though it be that God has created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things are ordained and numbered; yet, nevertheless, they that are damned have no order, nor hold any order. For the earth shall bear them no fruit. For, as the Prophet David says: “God shall destroy the fruits of the earth from them.” No water shall give them moisture, nor the air refreshment, nor the fire light. For, as Saint Basil says: “The burning of the fire of this world shall God give into Hell unto them that are damned; but the light and the clearness shall be given in Heaven unto His children”—just as the good man gives flesh to his children and bones to his hounds.

And since they shall have no hope of escape, Saint Job says at the last that horror and grisly dread shall dwell there without end. Horror is ever the dread of harm that is to come, and this dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of the damned. And therefore have they lost all their hope, and for seven causes.

First, because God their Judge shall be without mercy to them; they may not please Him, nor any of His saints; they can give nothing for their ransom; they shall have no voice wherewith to speak to Him; they cannot flee from pain; and they have no goodness within themselves which they might show to deliver them out of pain. And therefore says Solomon:

> “The wicked man dieth; and when he is dead he shall have no hope of escaping from pain.”

Whoever, then, will well understand these pains, and bethink him well that he has deserved these very pains for his sins, certainly he shall have more longing to sigh and weep than ever to sing and play. For, as Solomon says: “Whoso shall have the wisdom to know the pains that have been established and ordained for the punishment of sin, he will feel sorrow.” “This same knowledge,” says Saint Augustine, “maketh a man to bewail within his heart.”

The fourth point that ought to cause a man to feel contrition is the unhappy memory of the good that he has left here on earth; also the good that he has lost. Truly, the good deeds that he has left are either those that he wrought before he fell into mortal sin, or the good deeds he did while he lived in sin. Indeed the good deeds he did before he fell into sin have been all deadened and stultified and rendered null and void by the repeated sinning. The other good deeds, which he wrought while he lay in mortal sin, are utterly dead as to the effect they might have had on his life everlasting in Heaven.

And then the same good deeds that have been rendered null by repeated sinning, which good works he wrought while he stood in a state of grace, shall never quicken again without a true penitence. And thereof God says, by the mouth of Ezekiel:

> “If the righteous man shall turn again from his righteousness, and do wickedness, shall he live?”

Nay; for all the good works that he has wrought shall never be held in remembrance, for he shall die in his sin. And thereupon, as to that same chapter, Saint Gregory says thus: “That we shall understand this principally: that when we do mortal sin it is for naught that we rehearse or draw from memory the good works that we have wrought before.” For certainly, in the doing of mortal sin there is no trusting to the help of good that we have wrought before; that is to say, as it affects the everlasting life in Heaven.

But notwithstanding this, the good deeds quicken again and return again, and help and are of avail in attaining the everlasting life in Heaven when we have contrition. But indeed the good deeds that men do while they are in deadly sin, because they are done in deadly sin, shall never quicken again. For truly, that thing which never had life may never quicken; nevertheless, albeit these deeds avail nothing as to the perdurable life, yet they help to lighten the pains of Hell, or else to acquire temporal riches, or else, because of them, God will enlighten and illumine the heart of the sinful man to be repentant; and also they avail in accustoming a man to the doing of good deeds, to the end that the Fiend have the less power over his soul. And thus the compassionate Lord Jesus Christ wills that no good work be utterly lost; for in somewhat it shall avail.

But forasmuch as the good works that men do while they are in a state of grace are all mortified by sin following; and also, since all the good works that men do while they are in deadly sin are utterly dead as for the life perdurable in Heaven, well may that man who does no good work sing that new French song: *J’ai tout perdu mon temps et mon labour*. For certainly, sin bereaves a man both of goodness of nature and also of the goodness of grace. For truly, the grace of the Holy Ghost is like fire, that may not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forgoes its working, and even so grace faileth immediately it forsakes its working.

Then loses the sinful man the goodness of glory, which only is promised to good men that labour and work. Well may he be sorry then, that oweth all his life to God as long as he hath lived, and also as long as he shall live, and yet hath no goodness to pay his debt to God, to whom he oweth all his life. For trust well, “he shall give accounts,” as Saint Bernard says, “of all the goods that have been given him in this present life, and of how he hath expended them; in so much that there shall not perish a hair of his head, nor a moment of an hour shall perish of his time, that he shall not have to give a reckoning.”

### 12. The fifth thing that ought to move a man to contrition

The fifth thing that ought to move a man to contrition is remembrance of the Passion that Our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins. For, as Saint Bernard says:

> “While I live, I will have remembrance of the travails that Our Lord Christ suffered in preaching; His weariness in travailing, His temptations when He fasted, His long wakeings when He prayed, His tears when He wept for pity of good people; the woe and the shame and the filth that men said to Him; of the foul spitting that men spat in His face, of the buffets that men gave Him, of the foul grimaces and of the reproaches that men said to Him; of the nails wherewith He was nailed to the cross, and of all the remnant of His Passion that He suffered for my sins, and nothing for His guilt.”

And you shall understand that in man’s sin is every manner of order or ordinance turned upside-down. For it is true that God and reason and sensuality and the body of man were so ordained, that each of these four things should have lordship over that next under it; as thus: God should have lordship over reason, and reason over sensuality, and sensuality over the body of man. But truly, when men sin, all this order or ordinance is turned upside-down.

Therefore, then, forasmuch as the reason of man will not be subject nor obedient to God, Who is his Lord by right, therefore it loses the lordship that it should have over sensuality, and also over the body of man. And why? For sensuality rebelleth then against reason; and by that way, reason loseth the lordship over sensuality and over the body. For just as reason is rebel to God, right so is both sensuality rebel to reason and the body also. And truly, this disordered state and this rebellion Our Lord Jesus Christ suffered upon His precious body, and paid full dearly thus; and hear you now in what wise.

For—as much then as reason is rebel to God—therefore is man worthy to have sorrow and to die. This Our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for man after He had been betrayed by His disciple, and distressed and bound, “so that His blood burst out at every nail of His hands,” as Saint Augustine says. Moreover, for as much as the reason of man will not subdue sensuality when it may, therefore man is worthy of shame; and this suffered Our Lord Jesus Christ for man, when they spat in His visage. Furthermore, for as much then as the wretched body of man is rebel both to reason and to sensuality, therefore is it worthy of death. And this Our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for man upon the cross, where there was no part of His body free from great pain and bitter passion.

And all this Jesus Christ suffered, Who never forfeited. And therefore may it reasonably be said of Jesus thus: “Too much am I tormented for things the punishment of which I do not deserve, and too much disgraced for shame that belongs to man.” Therefore may the sinful man well say, as Saint Bernard says: “Accursed be the bitterness of my sin, for which there must be suffered so much bitterness.” For certainly, according to the diverse discordances of our wickedness, was the Passion of Jesus Christ ordained in diverse ways, as thus.

Certainly sinful man’s soul is betrayed unto the Devil by covetousness of temporal prosperity, and scorned by deceit when he chooses carnal delights; and it is tormented by impatience under adversity, and spat upon by servitude and subjection to sin; and at the last it is slain forever. For this disordination of sinful man was Jesus Christ first betrayed, and afterwards bound, Who came to unbind us from sin and pain. Then was He scorned, Who should have been only honoured in all things. Then was His face, which all mankind ought to have desired to see, and unto which angels desire to look, villainously spat upon. Then was He scourged Who had done nothing amiss; and finally, then was He crucified and slain. So was accomplished the word of Isaiah:

> “He was wounded for our misdeeds and defiled for our felonies.”

Now, since Jesus Christ took upon Himself the punishment for all our wickedness, much ought sinful man to weep and to bewail that for his sins the Son of God of Heaven should endure all this pain.

### 13. The sixth thing that ought to move a man to contrition

The sixth thing that ought to move a man to contrition is the hope of three things: that is to say, forgiveness of sin, and the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of Heaven, wherewith God shall reward man for his good deeds. And forasmuch as Jesus Christ gives us these gifts of His largess and of His sovereign bounty, therefore is He called *Jesus Nazarenus rex Judeorum*. Jesus means “Saviour” or “salvation,” in whom men shall hope to have forgiveness of sins, which is properly the salvation of sins.

And therefore said the angel to Joseph: “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, who shall save His people from their sins.” And hereof says Saint Peter: “There is no other name under heaven given to any man, whereby a man may be saved, but only Jesus.” Nazarenus is as much as to say “flourishing,” in which a man shall hope that He that gives remission of sins shall give him also grace to do well. For in the flower is hope of fruit in time to come; and in forgiveness of sins is hope of grace to do well.

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock,” saith Jesus: “if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.” That is to say, by the good works that he shall do, which works are the food of God; “and he shall sup with Me,” by the great joy that I shall give him. Thus shall man hope, for his works of penance, that God shall give him His realm, as He promised him in the Gospel.

### 14. How contrition shall be

Now shall a man understand in what manner shall be his contrition. I say that it shall be universal and total; this is to say, a man shall be very repentant for all his sins that he hath done in delight of his thought; for delight is full perilous. For there be two manners of consenting: that one of them is called consenting of affection, when a man is moved to do sin, and delighteth him long to think on that sin; and his reason perceiveth well that it is sin against the law of God, and yet his reason refraineth not his foul delight or inclination, though he see well openly that it is against the reverence of God. Although his reason consent not to do that sin in deed, yet say some doctors that such a delight that dwelleth long is full perilous, although it be never so little.

And also a man should sorrow, namely, for all that ever he hath desired against the law of God with perfect consenting of his reason; for thereof there is no doubt that it is deadly sin in consenting. For certainly there is no deadly sin that was not first in man’s thought, and after that in his delight; and so forth into consenting and into deed. Wherefore I say that many men never repent them of such thoughts and delights, nor never shrive them of it, but only of the deed of great sins outward. Wherefore I say that such wicked delights and wicked thoughts are subtle beguilers of them that shall be damned.

Moreover, man ought to sorrow for his wicked words as well as for his wicked deeds; for certainly the repentance of one singular sin, and not repenting of all his other sins, or else repenting of all his other sins and not of one singular sin, may not avail. For certainly God Almighty is all good; and therefore He forgiveth all, or else not at all. And hereof says Saint Augustine: “I know certainly that God is enemy to every sinner”; and how then? He that observeth one sin, shall he have forgiveness of the remnant of his other sins? Nay.

And furthermore, contrition should be wondrous sorrowful for every sin, both for hidden and open; it must be perfect sorrow for all, together with purpose of amendment.

## Middle English (Original Text, corrected for OCR errors)

a shadwe hath the lyknesse of the thing of which it is shadwe, but shadwe is nat the same thing of which it is shadwe. Right so fareth the peyne of helle; it is lyk deeth for the horrible anguish, and why? For it peyneth hem evere, as though they feholde dye anon; but certes they shal nat dye. For as seith Seint Gregorie: “to wrecche caytives shal be deeth with-oute deeth, and ende with-oute ende, and defaute with-oute failinge. For hir deeth shal alwey liven, and hir ende shal everemo biginne, and hir defaute shal nat faille.” And therfore seith Seint John the Evangelist:

> “They shullen folwe deeth, and they shul nat finde him; and they shul desyren to dye, and deeth shal flee fro hem.”

And eek Job seith: that “in helle is noon ordre of rule.” And al-be-it so that God hath creat alle thinges in right ordre, and nothing with-outen ordre, but alle thinges been ordeyned and nombred; yet natheles they that been dampned been no-thing in ordre, ne holden noon ordre. For the erthe ne shal berc hem no fruit. For, as the prophete David seith: “God shal destroye the fruit of the erthe as fro hem”; ne water ne shal yeve hem no moisture; ne the eyr no refresshing, ne fyr no light. For, as seith Seint Basilie: “the brenninge of the fyr of this world shal God yeven in helle to hem that been dampned; but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to hise children”; right as the gode man yeveth flesh to hise children, and bones to his houndes.

And for they shullen have noon hope to escape, seith Seint Job atte laste: that “horrour and grisly drede shal dwellen with-outen ende.” Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come, and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned. And therfore han they lorn al hir hope, for sevene causes. First, for God that is hir juge shal be with-outen mercy to hem; ne they may nat plese him, ne noon of hise halwes; ne they ne may yeve no-thing for hir raunson; ne they have no vois to speke to him; ne they may nat flee fro peyne; ne they have no goodnesse in hem, that they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne. And therfore seith Salomon: “the wikked man dyeth; and whan he is deed, he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne.” Who-so thanne wolde wel understande these peynes, and bithinke him weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his sinnes, certes, he sholde have more talent to syken and to wepe than for to singen and to pleye. For, as seith Salomon: “who-so that hadde the science to knowe the peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for sinne, he wolde make sorwe.” “Thilke science,” as seith Seint Augustin, “maketh a man to waymenten in his herte.”

ii. The fourthe point, that oghte maken a man to have contricion, is the sorweful remembrance of the good that he hath left to doon here in erthe; and eek the good that he hath lorn. Soothly, the gode werkes that he hath left, outher they been the gode werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly sinne, or elles the gode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in sinne. Soothly, the gode werkes that he dide bifom that he fil in sinne been al mortified and astoned and dulled by the ofte sinning. The othere gode werkes, that he wroghte whyl he lay in deedly sinne, they been outrely dede as to the lyf perdurable in hevene.

Thanne thilke gode werkes that been mortified by ofte sinning, whiche gode werkes he dide whyl he was in charitee, ne mowe nevere quiken agayn with-outen verray penitence. And therof seith God, by the mouth of Ezechiel: that, “if the rightful man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse, shal he live?” Nay; for alle the gode werkes that he hath wroght ne shul nevere been in remembrance; for he shal dyen in his sinne. And up-on thilke chapitre seith Seint Gregorie thus: “that we shull understonde this principally; that whan we doon deedly sinne, it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen into memorie the gode werkes that we han wroght bifom.” For certes, in the wërkinge of the deedly sinne, ther is no trust to no good werk that we han doon bifom; that is to seyn, as for to have therby the lyf perdurable in hevene.

But nathelees, the gode werkes quiken agayn, and comen agayn, and helpen, and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in hevene, whan we han contricion. But soothly, the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly sinne, for-as-muche as they were doon in deedly sinne, they may nevere quiken agayn. For certes, thing that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quikene; and nathelees, albe-it that they ne availlen noght to han the lyf perdurable, yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of helle, or elles to geten temporal richesse, or elles that God wole the rather enlumine and lightne the herte of the sinful man to have repentance; and eek they availlen for to usen a man to doon gode werkes, that the feend have the lasse power of his soule. And thus the curteis lord Jesu Crist wole that no good werke be lost; for in somwhat it shal availle.

But for-as-muche as the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in good lyf been al mortified by sinne folwinge; and eek, sith that alle the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly synne been outrely dede as for to have the lyf perdurable; wel may that man, that no good werke ne dooth, singe thilke newe Frensche song: *J’ay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour*. For certes, sinne bireveth a man bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the goodnesse of grace. For soothly, the grace of the Holy Goost fareth lyk fyr, that may nat been ydel; for fyr faileth anoon as it forleteth his wirkinge, and right so grace fayleth anoon as it forleteth his werkinge. Than leseth the sinful man the goodnesse of glorie, that only is bihight to gode men that labouren and werken. Wel may he be sory thanne, that oweth al his lif to God as longe as he hath lived, and eek as longe as he shal live, that no goodnesse ne hath to paye with his dette to God, to whom he oweth al his lif. For trust wel, “he shal yeven acountes,” as seith Seint Bernard, “of alle the godes that han be yeven him in this present lif, and how he hath hem despended; in so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer of his heed, ne a moment of an houre ne shal nat perisse of his tyme, that he ne shal yeve of it a rekening.”

13. The sixte thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is the hope of three thynges; that is to seyn, foryifnesse of sinne, and the yifte of grace wel for to do, and the glorie of hevene, with which God shal guerdone a man for his gode dedes. And for-as-muche as Jesu Crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee, therfore is he cleped *Jesus Nazarenus rex Judeorum*. Jesus is to seyn “saveour” or “salvacion,” on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of sinnes, which is proprely salvacion of sinnes. And therfore seyde the aungel to Joseph: “Thou shalt clepe his name Jesus, that shal saven his peple of hir sinnes.” And heer-of seith Seint Peter: “Ther is noon other name under hevene that is yeve to any man, by which a man may be saved, but only Jesus.”

Nazarenus is as muche for to seye as “florisshinge,” in which a man shal hope that he that yeveth him remission of sinnes shal yeve him eek grace wel for to do. For in the flour is hope of fruit in tyme comynge; and in foryifnesse of sinnes hope of grace wel for to do.

“I was atte dore of thyn herte,” seith Jesus, “and cleped for to entre; he that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of sinne. I wol entre into him by my grace, and soupe with him,” by the goode werkes that he shal doon; whiche werkes been the foode of God; “and he shal soupe with me,” by the grete joye that I shal yeven him. Thus shal man hope, for hise werkes of penaunce, that God shal yeven him his regne; as he bihoteth him in the Gospel.

14. Now shal a man understonde, in which manere shal been his contricion. I seye that it shal been universal and total; this is to seyn, a man shal be verray repentant for alle hise sinnes that he hath doon in delyt of his thoght; for delyt is ful perilous. For ther been two manere of consentinges; that oon of hem is cleped consenting of affeccion, whan a man is moeved to do sinne, and delyteth him longe for to thinke on that sinne; and his reson aperceyveth it wel, that it is sinne agayns the lawe of God, and yet his reson refreyneth nat his foul delyt or talent, though he see wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of God; al-though his reson ne consente noght to doon that sinne in dede, yet seyn somme doctours that swich delyt that dwelleth longe is ful perilous, al be it nevere so lite.

And also a man sholde sorwe, namely, for al that evere he hath desired agayn the lawe of God with perfit consenting of his reson; for ther-of is no doute, that it is deedly sinne in consenting. For certes, ther is no deedly sinne, that it nas first in mannes thought, and after that in his delyt; and so forth into consenting and into dede. Wherefore I seye that many men ne repenten hem nevere of swiche thoghtes and delytes, ne nevere shryven hem of it, but only of the dede of grete sinnes outward. Wherfore I seye that swiche wikked delytes and wikked thoghtes been subtile bigyleres of hem that shullen be dampned.

Moreover, man oghte to sorwe for his wikkede wordes as wel as for his wikkede dedes; for certes, the repentance of a singuler sinne, and nat repente of alle hise othere sinnes, or elles repenten him of alle hise othere sinnes, and nat of a singuler sinne, may nat availle. For certes God almighty is al good; and therfore he foryeveth al, or elles right noght. And heer-of seith Seint Augustin: “I woot certeinly that God is enemy to everich sinne;” and how thanne? He that observeth o sinne, shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of hise othere sinnes? Nay. And forther-over, contricion sholde be wonder sorweful and perfect, and with a firme purpose of amendement.

## Now shall a man understand in what manner shall be his contrition

Now shall a man understand in what manner shall be his contrition. I say that it shall be universal and total: that is to say, a man shall be truly repentant for all the sins that he has done in delight of his thought; for delight is very dangerous. For there are two ways of acquiescence; one called acquiescence of the affections, when a man is moved to do sin, and delights in long thinking thereon; and his reason well perceives that it is sin against the law of God, and yet his reason restrains not his soul's delight or appetite, though he see well that it is opposed to the reverence that is due to God; although his reason consent not to do that sin in very deed, yet some doctors say that dwelling long on such delight is full dangerous, be it ever so little.

And also a man should sorrow for all that he has ever desired against the law of God with perfect acquiescence of his reason; for there is no doubt of it, there is mortal sin in acquiescence. For truly, there is no mortal sin that was not first in man's thought, and after that in his delight, and so on unto acquiescence and unto deed. Wherefore I say, that many men never repent for such thoughts and delights, and never confess them, but only the actual performance of great sins. Wherefore I say that such wicked delights and wicked thoughts are subtle beguilers of those that shall be damned.

Moreover, a man ought to sorrow for his wicked words as well as for his wicked deeds; for truly, the repentance for a single sin, unaccompanied by repentance for all other sins, or else repentance for all other sins and not for a single sin, shall not avail. For certainly God Almighty is all good; and therefore He forgives all or nothing. And thereupon says Saint Augustine: “I know certainly that God is the enemy of every sinner.” And how then? He that continues to do one sin, shall have forgiveness for the rest of his sins? No.

Furthermore, contrition should be wondrous sorrowful and full of suffering; and for that God gives fully His mercy; and therefore, when my soul was suffering within me, I had remembrance of God, that my prayer might come unto Him. Moreover, contrition must be continual, and a man must keep and hold a steadfast purpose to shrive himself and to amend his way of life. For truly, while contrition lasts, man may continue to have hope of forgiveness; and of this comes hatred of sin, which destroys sin within himself and also in other folk, according to his ability. For which David says: “Ye that love God hate wickedness.” For trust this well, to love God is to love what He loves and to hate what He hates.

The last thing that man shall understand about contrition is this: What does contrition avail him? I say that at times contrition delivers a man from sin; as to which David says:

> “I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.”

And just as contrition nothing avails without firm purpose of shrift, if man have opportunity, just so shrift itself is of little worth without contrition. Moreover, contrition destroys the prison of Hell and makes weak and feeble all the strength of all the devils, and restores the gifts of the Holy Ghost and of all good virtues; and it cleanses the soul of sin, and delivers the soul from the pain of Hell and from the company of the Devil, and from the servitude of sin, and restores it unto all spiritual good and to the company and communion of Holy Church. And furthermore, it makes of him who was formerly the son of anger to be the son of grace; and all these things are proved by holy writ. And therefore he that would set his understanding to these things, he were full wise; for truly, he should not then, in all his life, have desire to sin, but should give his body and all his heart to the service of Jesus Christ, and do Him homage. For truly, Our sweet Lord Jesus Christ has spared us so graciously in our follies that, if He had not pity on man's soul, a sorry song indeed might all of us sing.

Forther-over, contricion moste be continucl, and that man have stedefast purpos to shryven him, and for to amenden him of his lyf. For soothly, whyl contricion lasteth, man may evere have hope of foryifnesse; and of this comth hate of sinne, that destroyeth sinne bothe in himself, and eek in other folk, at his power.

And more-over, contricion destroyeth the prison of helle, and maketh wayk and feble alle the strengthes of the develes, and restoreth the yiftes of the holy goost and of alle gode vertues; and it clenseth the soule of sinne, and delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle, and fro the companye of the devel, and fro the servage of sinne, and restoreth it to alle godes espirituels, and to the companye and communion of holy chirche.

For soothly, oure swete lord Jesu Crist hath spared us so debonairly in our folies, that if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule, a sory song we mighten alle singe.

## HERE ENDETH THE FIRST PART OF PENITENCE

## THE CANTERBURY TALES

## HERE FOLLOWETH

The second part of penitence is confession, which is the sign of contrition. Now shall you understand what confession is, and whether it ought to be used or not, and which things are necessary to true confession.

First, you shall understand that confession is the true discovery of sins to the priest; I say “true,” for a man must confess all the circumstances and conditions of his sin, in so far as he can. All must be told, and nothing excused or hidden, or covered up, and he must not vaunt his good deeds. And furthermore, it is necessary to understand whence his sins come, and how they increase, and what they are.

Of the birth of sins, Saint Paul says thus: that “as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; ... so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” And this man was Adam, by whom sin entered into the world when he broke the commandment of God. And therefore, he that at first was so mighty that he should never have died became such a one that he must needs die, whether he would or no; and all his progeny in this world, since they, in that man, sinned.

Behold, in the state of innocence, when Adam and Eve were naked in Paradise, and had no shame for their nakedness, how that the serpent, which was the wiliest of all the beasts that God had made, said to the woman: “Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” And the woman said unto the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ‘Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.’” And the serpent said unto the woman: “Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and delectable in the sight, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat; and gave also unto her husband, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened. And when they knew that they were naked, they sewed fig-leaves together into a kind of breeches to hide their members. There may you see that mortal sin had first suggestion from the Fiend, who is here figured by the serpent; and afterward the delight of the flesh, as shown here by Eve; and after that the acquiescence of reason, as is shown by Adam. For trust this well, though it were that the Fiend tempted Eve, that is to say, the flesh, and the flesh delighted in the beauty of the forbidden fruit, certainly until reason, that is Adam, consented to the eating of the fruit, yet stood he in the state of innocence. From that same Adam caught we all that original sin; for we are all descended from him in the flesh, engendered of vile and corrupt matter. And when the soul is put into a body, immediately is contracted original sin; and that which was at first merely the penalty of concupiscence becomes afterwards both penalty and sin. And therefore are we all born the sons of wrath and of everlasting damnation, were it not for the baptism we receive, which washes away the culpability; but, forsooth, the penalty remains within us, as temptation, and that penalty is called concupiscence. When it is wrongly disposed or established in man, it makes him desire, by the lust of the flesh, fleshly sin; desire, by the sight of his eyes, earthly things; and desire of high estate by pride of heart.

Now, to speak of the first desire, that is, concupiscence, according to the law for our members, which were lawfully made and by rightful word of God; I say, for as much as man is not obedient to God, Who is his Lord, therefore is the flesh disobedient to Him, through concupiscence, which is also called the nourishing of and the cause of sin. Therefore all the while that a man has within himself the penalty of concupiscence, it is impossible but that he will be sometimes tempted and moved in his flesh to do sin. And this shall not fail so long as he lives; it may well grow feeble and remote by virtue of baptism and by the grace of God through penitence; but it shall never be fully quenched so that he shall never be moved within himself, unless he be cooled by sickness or by maleficence of sorcery or by opiates.

For behold what Saint Paul says: “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary, the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.” The same Saint Paul, after his great penance on water and on land (on water by night and by day, in great peril and in great pain; on land in famine, in thirst, in cold, and naked, and once stoned almost unto death), yet said he: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” And Saint Jerome, when he had long lived in the desert, where he had no company but that of wild beasts, where he had no food but herbs, with only water to drink, and no bed but the naked earth, for which his flesh was black as an Ethiopian’s with heat and well-nigh destroyed with cold, yet said he that the heat of lechery boiled through all his body. Wherefore I know well and surely that they are deceived who say that they are never tempted in the flesh. Witness Saint James the apostle, who says that everyone is tempted in his own concupiscence. That is to say, each of us has cause and occasion to be tempted by sin that is nourished in the body. And thereupon says Saint John the Evangelist: “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”

Now shall you understand in what manner sin waxes or increases in man. The first thing to be considered is this same nurturing of sin, whereof I spoke before, this same fleshly concupiscence. And after that comes the subjection to the Devil, that is to say, the Devil’s bellows, wherewith he blows into man the fire of concupiscence. And after that a man bethinks himself whether he will do, or not, the thing to which he is tempted. And then, if a man withstand and put aside the first enticement of his flesh and the Fiend, then it is no sin; and if it be that he do not, he feels anon a flame of delight. And then it is well to be wary, and to guard himself, else he will fall anon into acquiescence to sin; and then he will do it, if he have time and place. And of this matter Moses says that the Devil says thus:

> “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.”

For certainly, just as a sword may part a thing in two pieces, just so acquiescence separates God from man. “And then will I slay him in his sinful deed.” Thus says the Fiend. For certainly, then is a man all dead in soul. And thus is sin accomplished by temptation, by delight, and by acquiescence; and then is the sin called actual.

Forsooth, sin is of two kinds; it is either venial, or mortal sin. Verily, when man loves any creature more than Jesu Christ our Creator, then is it mortal sin. And venial sin it is, if man love Jesu Christ less than he ought. For sooth, the effect of this venial sin is full perilous; for it amenuseth the love that men should have to God more and more. And therefore, if a man charge himself with many such venial sins, certes, but-if so be that he sometime discharge him of them by shrift, they may full lightly amenuse in him all the love that he hath to Jesu Christ; and in this wise skipeth venial into mortal sin. For certes, the more that a man chargeth his soul with venial sinnes, the more is he enclined to fall into mortal sin. And therefore, let us not be negligent to discharge us of venial sinnes. For the proverb saith: that many small make a great. And hearken this ensample. A great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a violence that it drowneth the ship. And the same harm doth sometimes the small drops of water, that enter through a little crevice into the thurrok, and into the bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they do not discharge them by time. And therefore, although there be a difference between these two causes of drowning, yet the ship is drowned. Right so fareth it sometimes of mortal sin, and of anoysome venial sins, when they multiply in a man so greatly, that those worldly things that he loveth, through which he sinneth venially, be as great in his heart as the love of God, or more. And therefore, the love of every thing that is not set in God nor done principally for God’s sake, although a man love it less than God, yet is it venial sin; and mortal sin, when the love of any thing weigheth in the heart of man as much as the love of God, or more. “Mortal sin,” as Saint Augustine saith, “is when a man turneth his heart from God, who that is true sovereign bounty that may not change, and giveth his heart to things that may change and flit”; and certes, that is every thing, save God of heaven. For sooth is, that if a man give his love, the which that he oweth all to God with all his heart, unto a creature, certes, as much of his love as he giveth to that creature, so much he bereveth from God; and therefore doth he sin. For he, that is debtor to God, ne yeldeth not to God all his dette, that is to say, all the love of his heart.

Now since man understandeth generally what is venial sin, then is it convenient to tell specially of sins which many a man peradventure deemeth not sins, and ne shriveth him not for them; yet they are sins. Truly, as clerics write, every time a man eats or drinks more than suffices for the sustenance of his body, it is certain that he thereby sinneth. And, too, when he speaks more than is necessary it is sin. Also, when he hears not benignly the complaint of the poor. Also, when he is in health of body and will not fast when other folk fast, and that without a reasonable excuse. Also, when he sleeps more than he needs, or when he comes, for that reason, too late to church, or to other places where works of charity are done. Also, when he enjoys his wife without a sovereign desire to procreate children to the honour of God, or when he does it without intention to yield to his wife the duty of his body. Also, when he will not visit the sick and the imprisoned, if he may do so. Also, if he love wife or child or any other worldly thing more than reason requires. Also, if he flatter or blandish more than, of necessity, he ought. Also, if he diminish or withdraw his alms to the poor. Also, if he prepare his food more delicately than is needful, or eat it too hastily or too greedily. Also, if he talk...

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## HERE ENDETH THE SECOND PART OF PENITENCE

## HERE FOLLOWETH THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS AND THEIR DEPENDENCIES, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND TYPES

Now it is a needful thing to tell which are the mortal sins, that is to say, the principal sins; they are all leashed together, but are different in their ways. Now they are called principal sins because they are the chief sins and the trunk from which branch all other sins. Of the root of these seven sins then is Pride, the general root of all harms; for of this root spring certain branches, as Ire, Envy, Accidie or Sloth, Avarice or Covetousness (to common understanding), Gluttony, and Lechery. And each of these chief sins hath his branches and his twigs, as shall be declared in their chapters following.

### THE PARSON’S TALE

#### Of Pride

And though so be that no man can utterly tell the number of the twigs and of the harms that come of Pride, yet will I show a part of them, as ye shall understand. There is disobedience, vaunting, hypocrisy, despite, arrogance, impudence, swelling of heart, insolence, elation, impatience, strife, contumacy, presumption, irreverence, pertinacity, vain glory; and many another twig that I cannot declare.

Disobedient is he that disobeys for spite the commandments of God and of his sovereigns, and of his ghostly father. Vaunter is he that boasts of the harm or of the goodness that he hath done. Hypocrite is he that hides himself to show such as he is, and shows himself such as he is not. Despiting is he that hath disdain of his neighbour, that is to say, of his fellow-Christian, or hath despite to do that which he ought to do. Arrogant is he that thinketh that he hath those goodnesses in him that he hath not, or winneth that he should have them by his deserts; or else he deems that he is that which he is not. Impudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of his sins. Swelling of heart is when a man rejoices of harm that he hath done. Insolent is he that despises in his judgment all other folk in regard of his value, and of his learning, and of his speaking, and of his bearing. Elation is when he may neither suffer to have a master nor a fellow. Impatient is he that will not be taught nor admonished of his vice, and by strife warring against truth willingly defends his folly. Contumax is he that through his indignation is against every authority or power of those that are his sovereigns. Presumption is when a man undertakes an enterprise that he ought not to do, or else that he may not do; and that is called overboldness. Irreverence is when men do not honour where they ought to do, and wait to be reverenced. Pertinacy is when a man defends his folly and trusts too much in his own wit. Vain glory is to have pomp and delight in his temporal highness, and to glorify himself in this worldly estate. Jangling is when men speak too much before folk, and chatter as a mill, and take no heed what they say.

And yet is there a private species of Pride, that waits first to be saluted ere he will salute, albeit he be less worth than that other is, perchance; and eke he waits or desires to sit, or else to go before him in the way, or kiss the pax, or be incensed, or go to offering before his neighbour, and such like semblable things; against his necessity, peradventure, save that in his heart and his intent is such a proud desire to be magnified and honoured before the people.

Now there are two manners of Pride; that one of them is within the heart of man, and that other is without. Of which, truly, these aforesaid things, and more than I have said, appertain to the pride that is in the heart of man; and that other species of pride is without. But nevertheless that one of these species of pride is a sign of that other, right as the gay leafsel at the tavern is a sign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things: as in speech and countenance, and in outrageous array of clothing; for certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man in the gospel. And, as Saint Gregory says, that precious clothing is culpable for the costliness of it, and for its softness, and for its strangeness and disguised fashion, and for the superfluity, or for the inordinate scantiness of it. Alas! may men not see, as in our days, the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely in too much superfluity, or else in too disordered scantiness?

As to the first sin, that is in superfluity of clothing, which maketh it so dear to the harm of the people; not only the cost of embroidering, the disguised indenting or barring, rounding, paling, winding, or bending, and semblable waste of cloth in vanity; but there is also costly furring in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to make holes, so much dagging of shears; furthermore the superfluity in length of the aforesaid gowns, trailing in the dung and in the mire, on horse and also on foot, as well of man as of woman, that all such trailing is verily in effect wasted, consumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is given to the poor; to great damage of the aforesaid poor folk. And that in sundry wise: this is to say, that the more that cloth is wasted, the more it costeth to the people for the scarcity; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such punched and dagged clothing to the poor folk, it is not convenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to help their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance of the elements.

Upon the other side, to speak of the horrible disordered scantiness of clothing, as are these cut slops or hainselins, that through their shortness do not cover the shameful members of man, to wicked intent. Alas! some of them show the mouth of their shaft, and the horrible swollen members, that seem like the malady of hernia, in the wrapping of their hose; and also the buttocks of them appear as if they were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon. Moreover, the wretched swollen members that they show through their disguising, in departing of their hose in white and red, seem as though half their shameful privy members were flayed. And if so be that they depart their hose in other colours, as white and black, or white and blue, or black and red, and so forth; then it seems, by variance of colour, that half the part of their privy members were corrupt by the fire of Saint Anthony, or by cancer, or by other such mishap. Of the hinder part of their buttocks, it is fully horrible to see. For certes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking ordure, that foul part they show to the people proudly in despite of honesty, which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends observed to show in their life.

Now as of the outrageous array of women, God wot, that though the visages of some of them seem full chaste and debonair, yet do they signify in their array of attire lickerousness and pride. I say not that honesty in clothing of man or woman is uncovenable, but certes the superfluity or disordered scantiness of clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of ornament or of apparel is in things that appertain to riding, as in too many delicate horses that are kept for delight, that are so fair, fat, and costly; and also to many a vicious knave that is sustained by cause of them; in too curious harness, as in saddles, in cruppers, poitrels, and bridles covered with precious caparison and rich, bars and plates of gold and of silver. For which God saith by Zechariah the prophet, “I will confound the riders of such horses.” These folk take little regard of the riding of God’s Son of Heaven, and of his harness when he rode upon the ass, and had no other housings but the poor clothes of his disciples; nor we read not that ever he rode on other beast. I speak this for the sin of superfluity, and not for reasonable honesty, when reason requireth.

And further, certes pride is greatly notified in holding of great retinue, when they be of little profit or of right no profit. And namely, when that retinue is felonous and hurtful to the people, by hardness of high lordship or by way of offices. For certes, such lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell, when they sustain the wickedness of their retinue. Or else when this folk of low degree, as those that hold hostelries, sustain the theft of their hostilers, and that is in many manner of deceits. Those manner of folk been the flies that follow the honey, or else the hounds that follow the carrion. Such aforesaid folk strangle spiritually their lordships; for which thus saith David the prophet, “Wickedness shall come upon such lordships, and God give that they shall descend into Hell all down; for in their houses are iniquities and shrewdnesses,” and not God of Heaven. And certes, but if they do amendment, right as God gave his benison to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharaoh by the service of Joseph, right so God will give his malison to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of their servants, but if they come to amendment.

Pride of the table appeareth eke full often; for certes, rich men are called to feasts, and poor folk are put away and rebuked. Also in excess of diverse meats and drinks; and namely, such manner baked meats and dish-meats, burning of wild fire, and painted and castellated with paper, and semblable waste; so that it is an abusion to think. And also in too great preciousness of vessels and in curious instruments of minstrelsy, whereby a man is stirred the more to the delights of luxury; if it be that he thereby sets his heart the less upon Jesus Christ, certainly it is a sin; and likewise the delights might be so great in this case that a man could easily fall thereby into mortal sin. The varieties of sin that arise out of pride, truly, when they arise with malice imagined, advised, and aforethought, or from habit, are mortal sins, and of that there is no doubt. And when they arise out of frailty, unadvisedly and suddenly, and are quickly withdrawn again — albeit they are grievous sins — I think that they are not mortal.

Now might men ask whence pride arises and takes its being, and I say: sometimes it springs out of the good things of nature, and sometimes from the benefits of Fortune, and sometimes from the good of grace itself. Certainly the good things of nature consist of either physical well-being or riches of the soul. Certainly physical well-being consists of the weal of the body, as strength, activity, beauty, good blood, and generous candour. The benefits of nature to the soul are good wit, keen understanding, clever talent, natural virtue, and good memory. The benefits of Fortune are riches, high rank, and the people’s praise. The good of grace consists of knowledge, power to suffer spiritual travail, benignity, virtuous contemplation, ability to withstand temptation, and similar things. Of which aforesaid things, certainly it is great folly in a man when he permits himself to be proud of any of them.

As for the benefits of nature, God knows that sometimes we receive them naturally as much to our detriment as to our profit. As, to take bodily health, certainly it passes away lightly enough, and moreover it is often the reason for the wickedness of the soul; for God knows that the flesh is a great enemy to the soul; and therefore, the more sound the body is, the more are we in danger of falling into sin. Also, to feel pride in the strength of one’s body is a great folly; for certainly the flesh lusts for that which is detrimental to the spirit, and ever the stronger the flesh is, the sorrier must the soul be: and above all this, strength of body and worldly boldness bring a man often into danger of mishap. Also, to be proud of his gentility is a great folly; for often the gentility of the body debases the gentility of the soul; and furthermore, we are all of one father and one mother; and we are of one nature, rotten and corrupt, both the rich and the poor. Forsooth, but one kind of gentility is praiseworthy, and that it is which clothes a man’s heart with virtue and morality and makes of him Christ’s child. For trust this well, that over whatsoever man sin has gained the mastery, that man is a very serf to sin.

Now there are general signs of gentility; as the eschewing of vice and ribaldry and servitude to sin. Men are called to feasts, and poor folk are put away and rebuked. Also in excess of diverse meats and drinks; and namely, such manner of baked meats and dish-meats, burning with wild fire, and painted and castellated with paper, and semblable waste; so that it is an abuse to think.

> “If a man love God in such manner that all that he ever does is done in the love of God, and truly for the love of God, because he burns with the love of God: behold, then, how much a drop of water falling in a furnace harms or proves troublesome; and just so much vexes the venial sin a man who is perfect in the love of Christ.”  
> — Saint Augustine

Men may also keep down venial sins by receiving worthily the precious body of Jesus Christ; also by receiving holy water; by alms-giving; by general confession of the *Confiteor* at Mass and at Compline; and by the blessings of bishops and of priests, and by other good works.

[§23]

shryveth him nat of the same thinges; and yet nathelees they been sinnes. Soothly, as thise clerkes wryten, this is to seyn, that at every tyme that a man eteth or drinketh more than suffyseth to the sustenaunce of his body in certein he dooth sinne. And eek whan he speketh more than nedeth, it is sinne. Eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre. Eke whan he is in hele of body and wol nat faste, whan othere folk faste, withouten cause resonable. Eke whan he slepeth more than nedeth, or whan he comth by thilke enchesoun to late to chirche, or to othere werkes of charite. Eke whan he useth his wif, withouten sovereyn desyr of engendrure, to the honour of god, or for the entente to yelde to his wif the dette of his body. Eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner, if he may. Eke if he love wif or child, or other worldly thing, more than resoun requyreth. Eke if he flatere or blandishe more than him oghte for any necessitee. Eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre. Eke if he apparailleth his mete more deliciously than nede is, or ete it to hastily by likerousnesse. Eke if he tale vanitees at chirche or at goddes service, or that he be a talker of ydel wordes of folye or of vileinye; for he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of dome. Eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thinges that he may nat perfoume. Eke whan that he, by lightnesse or folie, misseyeth or scometh his neighebore. Eke whan he hath any wikked suspicion of thing, ther he ne woot of it no soothfastnesse. Thise thinges and mo withoute nombre been sinnes, as seith seint Augustin.

Now shal men understonde, that al-be-it so that noon erthely man may eschue alle venial sinnes, yet may he refrevne him by the brenninge love that he hath to oure lord Jesu Crist, and by preyeres and confession and othere gode werkes, so that it shal but litel greve. For, as seith seint Augustin: “if a man love god in swiche manere, that al that evere he doth is in the love of god, and for the love of god verraily, for he brenneth in the love of god: loke, how muche that a drope of water that falleth in a foumeys ful of fyr anoyeth or greveth, so muche anoyeth a venial sinne unto a man that is parfit in the love of Jesu Crist.” Men may also refreyne venial sinne by receyvinge worthily of the precious body of Jesu Crist; by receyving eek of holy water; by almesdede; by general confession of *Confiteor* at masse and at complin; and by blessinge of bisshopes and of preestes, and by othere gode werkes.

THE CANTERBURY TALES

HERE ENDETH THE SECOND PART OF PENITENCE

HERE FOLLOWETH THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS AND THEIR DEPENDENCIES, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND TYPES

Now it is a needful thing to tell which been the deedly sinnes, this is to seyn, chieftaines of sinnes; alle they renne in o lees, but in diverse maneres. Now been they cleped chieftaines for-as-muche as they been chief, and springers of alle otheres. And the roote of these seven sinnes is Pryde, the general rote of alle harmes; for of this rote springen certein braunches, as Ire, Envye, Accidie or Slewthe, Avarice or Coveitise (to commune understondinge), Glotonye, and Lecherye. And everich of thise chief sinnes hath hise braunches and hise twigges, as shal be declared in hir chapitre folwinge.

§24. And thogh so be that no man can outrely telle the nombre of the twigges and of the harmes that cometh of Pryde, yet wol I shewe a partie of hem, as ye shul understonde. Ther is Inobedience, Avauntinge, Ipocrisie, Despyt, Arrogance, Impudence, Swellinge of herte, Insolence, Elacion, Impacience, Strif, Contumacie, Presumpcion, Irreverence, Pertinacie, Veyne Glorie; and many another twig that I can nat declare. Inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despyt to the comandements of god and to hise sovereyns, and to his goostly fader. Avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he hath doon. Ipocrite is he that hideth to shewe him swiche as he is, and sheweth him swiche as he noght is. Despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebore, that is to seyn, of his evenecristene, or hath despyt to doon that him oghte to do. Arrogant is he that thinketh that he hath thilke bountees in him that he hath noght, or weneth that he sholde have hem by his desertes; or elles he demeth that he be that he is not.

Impudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of his sinnes. Swellinge of herte is whan a man rejoyseth him of harm that he hath doon. Insolent is he that despiseth in his jugement alle othere folk as to regard of his value, and of his conning, and of his speking, and of his bering. Elacion is whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe. Impacient is he that wol nat been y-taught ne undemome of his vice, and by stryf werreyeth trouthe witingly, and defendeth his folye. Contumax is he that thurgh his indignacion is agayns everich auctoritee or power of hem that been his sovereyns. Presumpcion is whan a man undertaketh an empryse that him oghte nat do, or elles that he may nat do; and that is called Surquidrie. Irreverence is whan men do nat honour thereas hem oghte to doon, and waiten to be reverenced. Pertinacie is whan man defendeth his folye, and trusteth to muchel in his owene wit. Veyne glorie is for to have pompe and delyt in his temporel highnesse, and glorifie him in this worldly estaat. Janglinge is whan men speken to muche bifore folk, and clappen as a mille, and taken no kepe what they seye.

§25. And yet is ther a privee spece of Pryde, that waiteth first to be salewed er he wole salew, al be he lasse worth than that other is, per-aventure; and eke he waiteth or desyreth to sitte, or elles to goon above him in the wey, or kisse pax, or been encensed, or goon to offring bifore his neighebore, and swiche semblable thinges; agayns his duetec, per-aventure, but that he hath his herte and his entente in swich a proud desyr to be magnifyed and honoured bifore the peple.

§26. Now been ther two maneres of Pryde; that oon of hem is withinne the herte of man, and that other is withoute. Of whiche soothly thise forseyde thinges, and mo than I have seyd, appertenen to pryde that is in the herte of man; and that othere species of pryde been withoute. But natheles that oon of thise species of pryde is signe of that other, right as the gaye leefsel atte taverne is signe of the wyn that is in the celer. And this is in manye thinges: as in speche and contenaunce, and in outrageous array of clothing; for certes, if ther ne hadde be no sinne in clothing, Crist wolde nat have noted and spoken of the clothing of thilke riche man in the gospel. And, as seith Seint Gregorie, that precious clothing is coupable for the derth of it, and for his softenesse, and for his strangenesse and degysinesse, and for the superfluitee, or for the inordinat scantnesse of it. Allas! may men nat seen, as in oure dayes, the sinful costlewe array of clothinge, and namely in to muche superfluitee, or elles in to desordinat scantnesse?

§27. As to the firste sinne, that is in superfluitee of clothinge, which that maketh it so dere, to harm of the peple; nat only the cost of embrouding, the degyse endentinge or barringe, oundinge, palinge, windinge, or bendinge, and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee; but there is also costlewe furringe in hir gounes, so muche pounsoninge of chisels to maken holes, so muche dagginge of sheres; forth-with the superfluitee in lengthe of the forseide gounes, trailinge in the dong and in the myre, on horse and eek on fote, as wel of man as of womman, that al thilke trailing is verraily as in effect wasted, consumed, thredbare, and roten with donge, rather than it is yeven to the povre; to greet damage of the forseide povre folk. And that in sondry wyse: this is to seyn, that the more that clooth is wasted, the more it costeth to the peple for the scantnesse; and forther-over, if so be that they wolde yeven swich pounsoned and dagged clothing to the povre folk, it is nat convenient to were for hir estaat, ne suflisant to bete hir necessitee, to kepe hem fro the distemperance of the firmament.

Upon that other side, to speken of the horrible disordinat scantnesse of clothing, as been thise cutted sloppes or hainselins, that thurgh hir shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres of man, to wikked entente. Allas! somme of hem shewen the bocc of hir shap, and the horrible swollen membres, that semeth lyk the maladie of hirnia, in the wrappinge of hir hoses; and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the hindre part of a she-ape in the fulle of the mone. And moreover, the wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh the degysinge, in departinge of hir hoses in whyt and reed, semeth that half hir shameful privee membres weren flayn. And if so be that they departen hire hoses in othere colours, as is whyt and blak, or whyt and blew, or blak and reed, and so forth; thanne semeth it, as by variance of colour, that half the partie of hir privee membres were corrupt by the fyr of seint Antony, or by cancre, or by other swich meschaunce. Of the hindre part of hir buttokes, it is ful horrible for to see. For certes, in that partie of hir body ther-as they purgen hir stinkinge ordure, that foule partie shewe they to the peple proudly in despit of honestete, the which honestete that Jesu Crist and hise freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve.

Now as of the outrageous array of wommen, god woot, that though the visages of somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire, yet notifie they in hir array of atyr likerousnesse and pryde. I sey nat that honestete in clothinge of man or womman is uncovenable, but certes the superfluitee or disordinat scantnesse of clothinge is reprevable. Also the sinne of aornement or of apparaille is in thinges that apertenen to rydinge, as in to manye delicat horses that been holden for delyt, that been so faire, fatte, and costlewe; and also to many a vicious knave that is sustened by cause of hem; in to curious hameys, as in sadeles, in crouperes, peytrels, and brydles covered with precious clothing and riche, barres and plates of gold and of silver. For which god seith by Zakarie the prophete, “I wol confounde the ryderes of swiche horses.” This folk taken litel reward of the rydinge of goddes sone of hevene, and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse, and ne hadde noon other hameys but the povre clothes of hise disciples; ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on other beest. I speke this for the sinne of superfluitee, and nat for reasonable honestete, whan reson it requyreth.

And forther, certes pryde is greetly notified in holdinge of greet meyne, whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit. And namely, whan that meyne is felonous and damageous to the peple, by hardinesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices. For certes, swiche lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of helle, whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meyne. Or elles whan this folk of lowe degree, as thilke that holden hostelries, sustenen the thefte of hir hostilers, and that is in many manere of deceites. Thilke manere of folk been the flyes that folwen the hony, or elles the houndes that folwen the careyne. Swiche forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes; for which thus seith David the prophete, “wikked doeth mote come upon thilke lordshipes, and god yeve that they mote descenden into helle al doun; for in hir houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses,” and nat god of hevene. And certes, but-if they doon amendement, right as god yaf his benison to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharao by the service of Joseph, right so god wol yeve his malison to swiche lordshipes as sustenen the wikkednesse of hir servaunts, but-if they come to amendement.

Pryde of the table appereth eek ful ofte; for certes, riche men been cleped to festes, and povre folk been put aweie and rebuked. Also in excesse of diverse metes and drinkes; and namely, swiche manere bake metes and dish-metes, brenninge of wilde fyr, and peynted and castelled with papir, and semblable wast; so that it is abusion to thinke. And eek in preciousness of vessels and in curious instruments of minstrelsy, whereby a man is stirred the more to the delights of luxury; if it be that he thereby setteth his herte the lesse upon Jesu Crist, certes it is a sinne; and certes the delites myghte be so greet in this cas that a man myghte falle therebih into mortal sinne. The diversitees of sinne that arisen of pryde, certeinly, whan they arisen with malice imagyned, advised, and aforethought, or of habite, been mortal sinnes, and of that ther is no doute. And whan they arisen of frailty, unadvisedly and sodeynly, and ben sone withdrawe agayn — albeit they be grievous sinnes — I trowe they ben nat mortal.

Now myghte men axe wherof pryde springeth and taketh his being, and I seye: somtyme it springeth of the good thinges of nature, and somtyme of the benefits of Fortune, and somtyme of the good of grace it self. Certes, the good thinges of nature been of either bodily weal or richesse of the soule. The bodily weal consisteth in strengthe, activite, fairenesse, good blood, and generall candour. The benefits of nature to the soule be good witte, kene understandinge, naturel vertue, and good memory. The benefits of Fortune be richesse, high estat, and peoplees prays. The good of grace is knowelege, power to suffre spiritual travaile, benignite, vertuous contemplacion, power to withstonde temptacion, and semblable. Of whiche foresayd thinges, certes it is great folye in a man whan he suffreth him to be proud of any of hem.

As to the benefits of nature, God woot that somtyme we resceyven hem naturally as muche to our damage as to our profyt. As, for to taken bodily healthy, certes it passeth way lightliche, and also it is ofte the cause of wickednesse of the soule; for God woot that the flesh is a gret enemy to the soule; and therfore, the more the body is softe and sounde, the more in peril we been to sinne. Also to have pryde of the might of the body is gret folye; for certes the fleissh lusteth for that that is damageable to the spirit, and ever the stronger the fleissh is, the sorier moot the soule be: and over all thilke thinges, strengthe of body and worldly hardiness bringen men ofte to mischaunce. Also to be proud of his gentilesse is a greet folye; for oft the gentilesse of the body abateth the gentilesse of the soule; and further moe, we been alle of o fader and of o moder; and of o nature rotten and corrupt, both riche and povre. For certes, but o kynde of gentilesse is praiseworthy, and that is that which clotheth a mannes herte with vertu and maners, and maketh hym a child of Crist. For putte wel in remembraunce, that wher-so-ever sinne hath gotten domynion, that man is a verraie servant to sinne.

# THE CANTERBURY TALES

## THE PARSON’S TALE

### The Remedy Against the Sin of Pride

to greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee of minstralcie, by whiche a man is stired the more to delyces of luxurie, if so be that he sette his herte the lasse upon oure lord Jesu Crist, certein it is a sinne; and certeinly the delyces mighte been so grete in this caas, that man mighte lightly falle by hem into deedly sinne. The especes that sourden of Pryde, soothly whan they sourden of malice ymagined, avysed, and forncast, or elles of usage, been deedly synnes, it is no doute. And whan they sourden by freletee unavysed sodeinly, and sodeinly withdrawen ayein, al been they grevouse sinnes, I gesse that they ne been nat deedly. Now mighte men axe wher-of that Pryde sourdeth and springeth, and I seye: somtyme it springeth of the goodes of nature, and somtyme of the goodes of fortune, and somtyme of the goodes of grace.

Certes, the goodes of nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in goodes of soule. Certes, goodes of body been hele of body, as strengthe, delivemesse, beautee, gentrye, franchise. Goodes of nature of the soule been good wit, sharp understandinge, subtil engin, vertu naturel, good memorie. Goodes of fortune been richesses, highe degrees of lordshipes, preisinges of the peple. Goodes of grace been science, power to suffre spirituel travaille, benignitee, vertuous contemplacion, withstandinge of temptacion, and semblable thinges. Of whiche forseyde goodes, certes it is a ful greet folye a man to pryden him in any of hem alle. Now as for to speken of goodes of nature, god woot that somtyme we han hem in nature as muche to oure damage as to oure profit. As, for to speken of hele of body; certes it passeth ful lightly, and eek it is ful ofte encheson of the siknesse of oure soule; for god woot, the flesh is a ful greet enemy to the soule: and therfore, the more that the body is hool, the more be we in peril to falle. Eke for to pryde him in his strengthe of body, it is an heigh folye; for certes, the flesh coveiteth agayn the spirit, and ay the more strong that the flesh is, the sorier may the soule be: and, over al this, strengthe of body and worldly hardinesse causeth ful ofte many a man to peril and meschaunce. Eek for to pryde him of his gentrye is ful greet folye; for ofte tyme the gentrye of the body binimeth the gentrye of the soule; and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o moder; and alle we been of o nature roten and corrupt, both riche and povre. For sothe, oo manere gentrye is fortopreise, that apparailleth mannes corage with vertues and moralitees, and maketh him Cristes child. For truste wel, that over what man sinne hath maistrie, he is a verray cherl to sinne.

28. Now been ther generale signes of gentilesse; as eschuewinge of vyce and ribaudye and servage of sinne, in word, in werk, and contenance; and usinge vertu, curteisye, and clennesse, and to be liberal, that is to seyn, large by mesure; for thilke that passeth mesure is folye and sinne. Another is, to remembre him of bountee that he of other folk hath receyved. Another is, to be benigne to hise goode subgetis; wherfore, as seith Senek, “ther is no-thing more covenable to a man of heigh estaat than debonairetee and pitee. And therfore thise flyes that men clepeth bees, whan they maken hir king, they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith he may stinge.” Another is, a man to have a noble herte and a diligent, to attayne to heighe vertuouse thinges. Now certes, a man to pryde him in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folye; for thilke yiftes of grace that sholde have turned him to goodnesse and to medicine, turneth him to venim and to confusion, as seith seint Gregorie. Certes also, who-so prydeth him in the goodes of fortune, he is a ful greet fool; for somtyme is a man a greet lord by the morwe, that is a caitif and a wrecche er it be night: and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deeth; somtyme the delyces of a man is cause of the grevous maladye thurgh which he dyeth. Certes, the commendacion of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful brotel for to triste; this day they preyse, tomorwe they blame. God woot, desyr to have commendacion of the peple hath caused deeth to many a bisy man.

in word, in ded, and in contenance; and usyng vertu, curtesye, and clennesse, and to been liberal, that is to seyn, large by mesure; for that which passeth mesure is folye and sinne. Another is, to remembre him of bountee that he of other folk hath receyved. Another is, to be benigne to hise goode subgetis; wherfore, as seith Senek, “ther is nothing more covenable to a man of heigh estaat than debonairetee and pitee.

Now certes, a man to pryde him in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folye; for thilke yiftes of grace that sholde have turned him to goodnesse and to medicine, turneth him to venim and to confusion, as seith seint Gregorie. Certes also, who-so prydeth him in the goodes of fortune, he is a ful greet fool; for som-tyme is a man a greet lord by the morwe, that is a caitif and a wrecche er it be night: and som-tyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deeth; som-tyme the delyces of a man is cause of the grevous maladye thurgh which he dyeth. Certes, the commendacion of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful brotel for to triste; this day they preyse, tomorwe they blame. God woot, desyr to have commendacion of the peple hath caused deeth to many a bisy man.

Now that ye han understonde what is pryde, and whiche been the speces of it, and whennes pryde sourdeth and springeth; now shul ye understonde which is the remedie agayns the sinne of pryde, and that is humilitee or mekenesse. That is a vertu, thurgh which a man hath verrey knoweleche of him-self, and holdeth of himself no prys ne deyntee as in regard of hise desertes, consideringe evere his freletee. Now been ther three maneres of humilitee; as humilitee in herte, and another humilitee in his mouth; the thridde in hise werkes. The humilitee in herte is in foure maneres: that oon is, whan a man holdeth him-self as noght worth bifore god of hevene. Another is, whan he ne despyseth noon other man. The thridde is, whan he rekketh nat thogh men holde him noght worth. The ferthe is, whan he nis nat sory of his humiliacion.

Also, the humilitee of mouth is in foure thinges: in attempree speche, and in humblesse of speche, and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth that he is swich as him thinketh that he is in his herte. Another is, whan he preiseth the bountee of another man, and nothing ther-of amenuseth. Humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres: the firste is, whan he putteth othere men bifore him. The seconde is, to chese the loweste place over-al. The thridde is, gladly to assente to good conseil. The ferthe is, to stonde gladly to the award of hise sovereyns, or of him that is in hiyer degree; certein, this is a greet werk of humilitee.

Now, since it hath come to pass that ye have understood what pride is, and what the species of it are, and whence pride arises and springeth, now ye shall understand what is the remedy against the sin of pride, and that is humility or meekness. That is a virtue, through which a man hath very knowledge of himself, and holdeth of himself no price nor deyntee in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty. Now there are three manners of humility: humility in heart, another humility in the mouth, the third in his works. Humility of heart is in four manners: one is, when a man holdeth himself as naught worth before God of Heaven. Another is, when he despises no other man. The third is, when he recketh not though men hold him naught worth. The fourth is, when he is not sorry for his humiliation.

Also, humility of mouth is in four things: in temperate speech, and in meekness of speech, and when he acknowledgeth with his own mouth that he is such as he thinketh himself to be in his heart. Another is, when he praises the goodness of another man, and belittles nothing thereof. Humility also in works is in four manners: the first is, when he putteth other men before him. The second is, to choose the lowest place everywhere. The third is, gladly to assent to good counsel. The fourth is, to stand gladly to the award of his sovereigns, or of him that is in higher degree; certainly, this is a great work of humility.

## Here Followeth Envy

After pride I will speak of the foul sin of envy, which is, according to the word of the philosopher, sorrow for other men's prosperity; and according to the word of Saint Augustine, it is sorrow for other men's weal and joy for other men's harm. This foul sin is flatly against the Holy Ghost. Be it that every sin is in opposition to the Holy Ghost, yet nevertheless, for as much as goodness appertaineth properly to the Holy Ghost and envy springs by nature out of malice, therefore is it especially against the goodness of the Holy Ghost. Now malice hath two species, that is to say, a heart hardened in wickedness, or else the flesh of man is so blind that he does not consider himself to be in sin, or he cares not that he is in sin, which is the hardihood of the Devil. The other kind of malice is, when a man wars against the truth, knowing that it is truth. Also, when he wars against the grace that God has given to his neighbour; and all this is envy. Certainly, then, envy is the worst sin there is. For truly, all other sins are sometime against only one special virtue; but truly, envy is against all virtues and against all goodnesses; for it is sorry for all the virtues of its neighbour; and in this way it differs from all other sins. For hardly is there any sin that has not some delight in itself, save only envy, which ever has of itself but anguish and sorrow. The kinds of envy are these: there is, first, sorrow for other men's goodness and prosperity; and prosperity being naturally a thing for joy, then envy is a sin against nature. The second kind of envy is joy in other men's harm; and this is naturally like the Devil, who always rejoices in man's harm. From these two species comes backbiting; and this sin of backbiting, or detraction, has certain forms, as thus. A man praises his neighbour with a wicked intention, for he puts always a wicked twist into it at the end. Always he puts a “but” in at the end, which implies more blame than all the praise is worth. The second form is, when a man is good and does or says a thing to good intent, the backbiter turns all this goodness upside-down to his own evil end. The third is, to belittle the goodness of a neighbour. The fourth form of backbiting is this: that if a man say good of a man, then the backbiter says, “Faith, such or such a man is better than he,” in disparagement of him that men praise. The fifth form is this, to assent gladly and to listen gladly to the evil that folk speak of others. This sin is a great one; and it grows according to the wicked endeavours of the backbiter. After backbiting comes grumbling or murmuring; and sometimes it springs from impatience with God, and sometimes with man. Impatience with God it is when the man grumbles against the pains of Hell, or against poverty, or loss of chattels, or against rain or tempest; or else complains that scoundrels prosper, or else that good men have adversity. And all these things should men suffer patiently, for they come by the rightful judgment and ordinance of God. Sometimes grumbling comes of avarice; as Judas complained of the Magdalen when she anointed the head of Our Lord Jesus Christ with her precious ointment. This manner murmure is such as when a man grumbles at good that he himself hath done, or that other folk do of their own chattels. Sometimes comes murmur of Pride; as when Simon the Pharisee grumbled against the Magdalen, when she approached to Jesus Christ, and wept at His feet for her sins. And sometimes grumbling sourdeth of Envy; when men discover a man's harm that was privy, or bear on hand a thing that is false. Murmur is often among servants, that grudge when their sovereigns bid them do lawful things; and, for-as-much as they dare not openly gainsay the commandments of their sovereigns, yet will they say harm, and grudge, and murmur privily for very despite; which words men clepen the Devil's *Paternoster*, though so be that the Devil never had a Paternoster but that lewed folk given it such a name. Sometimes grumbling cometh of ire or privy hate, that nourisheth rancour in heart, as afterward I shall declare. Then cometh eke bitterness of heart; through which bitterness every good deed of his neighbour seemeth to him bitter and unsavoury. Then cometh discord, that unbindeth all manner of friendship.

Thanne comth scominge, as whan a man seketh occasioñ to anoyen his neighebor, al do he never so weel. Thanne comth accusinge, as whan man seketh occasioun to anoyen his neighebor, which that is lyk to the craft of the devel, that waiteth bothe night and day to accusen us alle. Thanne comth malignitee, thurgh which a man anoyeth his neighebor privily if he may; and if he noght may, algate his wikked wil ne shal nat wante, as for to brennen his hous privily, or empoysone or sleen hise bestes, and semblable thinges.

Lord Jesu Christ with her precious oyntement. This murmuring is such as when a man gruccheth at good that he himself dooth, or that other folk do of their own catel. Somtyme comth murmur of Pryde; as whan Simon the Pharisee grucched against the Magdaleyne, whan she approached to Jesu Crist, and wepte at his feet for her sinnes. And somtyme grucching sourdeth of Envye; whan men discovereth a mannes harm that was privee, or bereth him on hond thing that is fals. Murmur is ofte amonges servaunts, that grucchen whan hir sovereyns bidden hem doon lawful thinges; and, for-as-muche as they dar nat openly withseye the commandments of hir sovereyns, yet wol they seyn harm, and grucchen, and murmur privily for verray despit; which wordes men clepen the develes *Paternoster*, though so be that the devel nevere hadde Paternoster but that lewed folk yeven it swich a name. Somtyme grucching comth of ire or prive hate, that norisseth rancour in herte, as afterward I shal declare. Thanne cometh eke bitternesse of herte; thurgh which bitternesse every good dede of his neighebor semeth to him bitter and unsavoury. Thanne comth discord, that unbindeth alle manere of frendshipe.

The Remedy Against the Sin of Envy

31. Now wol I speke of the remedie agayns this foule sinne of Envye. First is the love of God principal, and loving of his neighbour as himself; for soothly, that oon ne may nat been without that other. And truste wel, that in the name of thy neighbour thou shalt understonde the name of thy brother; for certes alle we have o fader fleshly, and o moder, that is to seyn, Adam and Eve; and eke o fader espirituel, and that is God of Hevene. Thy neighbour artow holden for to love, and wilne him alle goodnesse; and therfore seith God, “Love thy neighbour as thyself,” that is to seyn, to salvation bothe of life and of soule. And moreover, thou shalt love him in word, and in benigne amonestinge, and chastisinge; and conforten him in his anoyes, and preye for him with al thyn herte. And in dede thou shalt love him in swich wise, that thou shalt doon to him in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene persone. And therfore thou ne shalt doon him no damage in wikked word, ne harm in his body, ne in his catel, ne in his soule by entysing of wikked ensample. Thou shalt nat desyren his wyf, ne none of hise thinges. Understond eke, that in the name of neighbour is comprehended his enemy. Certes man shal loven his enemy by the commandement of God; and soothly thy frend shaltow love in God. I seye, thyn enemy shaltow love for Goddes sake, by his commandement. For if it were reson that a man sholde haten his enemy, for sothe God nolde nat receiven us to his love that been his enemys. Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym, he shal doon three thinges, as thus. Agayns hate and rancour of herte, he shal love him in herte. Agayns chyding and wikkede wordes, he shal preye for his enemy. And agayn the wikked dede of his enemy, he shal doon him bountee. For Crist seith, “Loveth youre enemys, and preyeth for hem that speke yow harm; and eek for hem that yow chacen and pursuewen, and doth bountee to hem that yow haten.” Lo, thus comaundeth us oure lord Jesu Crist, to do to oure enemys. For soothly, nature dryveth us to loven oure frendes, and parfey, oure enemys han more nede to love than our frendes; and they that more nede have, certes, to hem shal men doon goodnesse; and certes, in thilke dede have we remembrance of the love of Jesu Crist, that deyde for hise enemys. And in-as-muche as thilke love is the more grevous to performe, in-so-muche is the more gretter the merite; and therfore the lovinge of oure enemy hath confounded the venim of the devel. For right as the devel is disconfited by humilitee, right so is he wounded to the deeth by love of oure enemy. Certes, thanne is love the medicine that casteth out the venim of Envye fro mannes herte. The speces of this sinne shullen be more largely in hir chapters following declared.

Now will I speak of the remedy against this foul sin of Envy. First is the love of God principal, and the loving of his neighbour as himself; for truly the one cannot be without the other. And trust well that by the name of thy neighbour thou shalt understand the name of thy brother; for certainly we all have one father fleshly, and one mother, that is to say Adam and Eve; and also one father spiritual, and that is God of Heaven. Thy neighbour thou art bound to love, and to wish him all goodness; and therefore God saith, “Love thy neighbour as thyself,” that is to say, to the salvation both of life and of the soul. And moreover thou shalt love him in word, and in benign admonishing and chastising; and comfort him in his annoyances, and pray for him with all thine heart. And in deed thou shalt love him in such wise that thou shalt do unto him in charity as thou wouldest that it were done to thine own person. And therefore thou shalt not do him any damage in wicked word, nor harm in his body, nor in his goods, nor in his soul by enticing of wicked example. Thou shalt not desire his wife, nor any of his things. Understand also that in the name of neighbour is comprehended his enemy. Certainly a man shall love his enemy by the commandment of God; and truly thy friend shalt thou love in God. I say, thy enemy shalt thou love for God’s sake, by His commandment. For if it were reasonable that a man should hate his enemy, forsooth God would not receive us to His love that are His enemies. Against three manners of wrongs that his enemy doeth to him, he shall do three things, thus: Against hate and rancour of heart, he shall love him in heart. Against chiding and wicked words, he shall pray for his enemy. And against the wicked deed of his enemy, he shall do him kindness. For Christ saith, “Love your enemies, and pray for them that speak you harm; and also for them that chase and persecute you, and do goodness to them that hate you.” Lo, thus commands us our Lord Jesus Christ to do unto our enemies. For truly nature driveth us to love our friends, and perforce our enemies have more need of love than our friends; and they that have more need, surely to them shall men do goodness; and certainly in that deed have we remembrance of the love of Jesus Christ, who died for His enemies. And inasmuch as that love is the more grievous to perform, in so much is the more greater the merit; and therefore the loving of our enemy hath confounded the venom of the Devil. For even as the Devil is discomfited by humility, even so is he wounded unto death by love of our enemy. Certainly then is love the medicine that casteth out the venom of Envy from man's heart. The species of this sin shall be more largely declared in their following chapters.

## Here Followeth Wrath

After Envy will I describe the sin of anger. For truly, whoso hath envy upon his neighbour will commonly find himself a matter of wrath, in word or in deed, against him to whom he hath envy. And as well cometh Wrath of Pride as of Envy; for truly he that is proud or envious is lightly wroth.

This sin of anger, according to Saint Augustine, is a wicked determination to be avenged by word or by deed. Anger, according to the philosopher, is the hot blood of man quickened in his heart, because of which he wishes to harm him whom he hates. For truly, the heart of man, by the heating and stirring of his blood, grows so disturbed that he is put out of all ability to judge reasonably. But you shall understand that anger manifests itself in two manners; one of them is good, the other bad. The good anger is caused by zeal for goodness, whereof a man is enraged by wickedness and against wickedness; and thereupon a wise man says that “Anger is better than play.” This anger is gentle and without bitterness; not felt against the man, but against the misdeed of the man, as the Prophet David says: Iras...

32. After Envye wol I discryven the sinne of Ire. For soothly, who-so hath envye upon his neighbor, anon he wol comunly finde him a matere of wrathe, in word or in dede, agayns him to whom he hath envye. And as wel comth Ire of Pryde, as of Envye; for soothly, he that is proude or envious is lightly wrooth.

### 33.

This sinne of Ire, after the discryving of seint Augustin, is wikked wil to been avenged by word or by dede. Ire, after the philosophre, is the fervent blood of man y-quiked in his herte, thurgh which he wole harm to him that he hateth. For certes the herte of man, by eschaufinge and moevinge of his blood, wexeth so trouble, that he is out of alle jugement of resoun. But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two maneres; that oon of hem is good, and that other is wikked. The gode Ire is by jalousye of goodnesse, thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse and agayns wikkednesse; and therfore seith a wys man, that “Ire is bet than pley.” This Ire is with debonairetee, and it is wrooth wuthouten bitterncsse; nat wrooth agayns the man, but wrooth with the misdede of the man; as seith the prophete David, *Irascimini et nolite peccare.* Now understandeth, that wikked Ire is in two maneres, that is to seyn, sodeyn Ire or hastif Ire, withouten avisement and consentinge of resoun. The mening and the sens of this is, that the resoun of man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn Ire; and thanne it is venial. Another Ire is ful wikked, that comth of felonye of herte avysed and cast bifom; with wikked wil to do vengeance, and therto his resoun consenteth; and soothly this is deedly sinne. This Ire is so displesant to god, that it troubleth his hous and chaceth the holy goost out of mannes soule, and wasteth and destroyeth the lyknesse of god, that is to seyn, the vertu that is in mannes soule; and put in him the lyknesse of the devel, and binimeth the man fro god that is his rightful lord. This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel; for it is the develes foumeys, that is eschaufed with the fyr of helle.

For certes, right so as fyr is more mighty to destroyen erthely thinges than any other element, right so Ire is mighty to destroyen alle spirituel thinges. Loke how that fyr of smale gledes, that been almost dede under asshen, wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brimstoon; right so Ire wol everemo quiken agayn, whan it is touched by the pryde that is covered in mannes herte. For certes fyr ne may nat comen out of no-thing, but-if it were first in the same thing naturelly; as fyr is drawen out of flintes with steel. And right so as pryde is ofte tyme matere of Ire, right so is rancour norice and keper of Ire. Ther is a maner tree, as seith seint Isidre, that whan men maken fyr of thilke tree, and covere the coles of it with asshen, soothly the fyr of it wol lasten al a yeer or more. And right so fareth it of rancour; whan it is ones conceyved in the hertes of som men, certein, it wol lasten peraventure from oon Estre day unto another Estre-day, and more. But certes, thilke man is ful fer fro the mercy of god al thilke while.

### 34.

In this forseyde develes foumeys ther forgen three shrewes: Pryde, that ay bloweth and encreseth the fyr by chydinge and wikked wordes. Thanne stant Envye, and holdeth the hote iren upon the herte of man with a peire of longe tonges of long rancour. And thanne stant the sinne of contumelie or stryf and cheeste, and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevinges. Certes, this cursed sinne anoyeth bothe to the man him-self and eek to his neighebor. For soothly, almost al the harm that any man dooth to his neighbore comth of wratthe. For certes, outrageous wratthe doth al that evere the devel him comaundeth; for he ne spareth neither Crist, ne his swete mooder. And in his outrageous anger and Ire, alas! alas! ful many oon at that tyme feleth in his herte ful wikkedly, bothe of Crist and of alle hise halwes. Is nat this a cursed vice? Yis, certes. Allas! it binimeth from man his wit and his resoun, and al his debonaire lyf espirituel that sholde kepen his soule. Certes, it binimeth eek goddes due lordshipe, and that is mannes soule, and the love of hise neighbores. It stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe. It reveth him the quiete of his herte, and subverteth his soule.

> *Irascimini et nolite peccare.*

Now understand, that wicked anger is manifested in two manners, that is to say, sudden or hasty anger, without the advice and counsel of reason. The meaning and the sense of this is, that the reason of man consents not to this sudden anger, and so it is venial. Another anger is full wicked, which comes of sullenness of heart, with malice aforethought and with wicked determination to take vengeance, and to which reason assents; and this, truly, is mortal sin. This form of anger is so displeasing to God that it troubles His house and drives the Holy Ghost out of man’s soul, and wastes and destroys the likeness of God, that is to say, the virtue that is in man’s soul; and it puts within him the likeness of the Devil, and takes the man away from God, his rightful Lord. This form of anger is a great joy to the Devil; for it is the Devil’s furnace, heated with the fire of Hell.

For certainly, just as fire is the mightiest of earth’s engines of destruction, just so ire is mightiest to destroy things spiritual. Observe how a fire of smouldering coals, almost extinct under the ashes, will quicken again when touched by brimstone; just so will anger quicken again when it is touched by the pride that lies hidden in man’s heart. For certainly fire cannot come from nothing, but must first be naturally dormant within a thing as it is drawn out of flints with steel. And just as pride is often the matter of which anger is made, just so is rancour the nurse and keeper of anger. There is a kind of tree, as Saint Isidore says, which, when men make a fire of the wood of it, and then cover over the coals with ashes, truly the embers will live and last a year or more. And just so fares it with rancour; when it is once conceived in the hearts of some men, certainly it will last, perchance, from one Easter-day to another Easter-day, and longer. But truly, such men are very far from the mercy of God all that while.

In this aforesaid Devil’s furnace there are forged three evils: pride that ever fans and increases the fire by chiding and wicked words. Then stands up envy and holds the hot iron upon the heart of man with a pair of long tongs of abiding rancour. And then stands up the sin of contumely, or strife and wrangling, and strikes and hammers with villainous reproaches. Certainly, this cursed sin injures both the man who does it and his neighbour. For truly, almost all the harm that any man does to his neighbour comes from wrath. For certainly, outrageous wrath does all that the Devil orders; for it spares neither Christ nor His Sweet Mother. And in his outrageous anger and ire, alas! full many a one at that time feels in his heart right wickedly, both as to Christ and as to His saints. Is not this a cursed vice? Yes, certainly. Alas! It takes from man his wit and his reason and all the kindly spiritual life that should guard his soul. Certainly, it takes away also God’s due authority, and that is man’s soul and the love of his neighbour. It strives always against truth, also. It bereaves him of the peace of his heart and subverts his soul.

From anger come these stinking engendcrings: first hate, which is old wrajh; discord, by which a man forsakes his old friend whom he has long loved. And then come strife and every kind of wrong that man does to his neighbour, in body or in goods. Of this cursed sin of anger comes manslaughter also. And understand well that homicide, manslaughter, that is, is of different kinds. Some kinds of homicide are spiritual, and some are bodily. Spiritual manslaughter lies in six things. First, hate; and as Saint John says: “He that hateth his brother committeth homicide.” Homicide is also accomplished by backbiting; and of backbiters Solomon says that “They have two swords wherewith they slay their neighbours.” For truly, it is as wicked to take away a man’s good name as his life. Homicide consists also in the giving of wicked counsel deceitfully, as in counselling one to levy wrongful duties and taxes. And Solomon says that cruel masters are like roaring lions and hungry bears, in withholding or diminishing the wages (or the hire) of servants; or else in usury; or in withholding alms from poor folk. As to which the wise man says: “Feed him who is dying of hunger.” For indeed, unless you feed him, you slay him; and all these are mortal sins.

Bodily homicide is when you slay a man with your tongue in some manner; as when you give command to slay a man, or else counsel him to the slaying of another. Homicide in deed is in four manners. One is by law; as when a judge condemns a culpable man to death. But let the judge take care that he do it rightfully, and that he do it not for delight in the spilling out of blood, but only for the doing of justice. Another kind of homicide is that which is done by necessity, as when one man slays another in his own defence, and when he may not otherwise escape his own death. But certainly, if he may escape without killing his adversary, and yet slays him, he commits sin, and he shall bear the punishment for mortal sin. Also, if a man by force of circumstances, or by chance, shoot an arrow or cast a stone with which he kill a man, he commits homicide. Also, if a woman negligently overlie her child in her sleep, it is homicide and mortal sin. Also, when a man interferes with the conception of a child, and makes a woman barren by the drinking of poisonous drugs, whereby she cannot conceive, or slays an unborn child deliberately, by drugs or by the introduction of certain substances into her secret parts with intent to slay the child; or does any unnatural sin whereby man or woman spill his or her fluid in such manner or in such place as a child cannot be conceited; or if a woman, having conceived, so hurt herself that she slays her child, it is homicide. What do we say of women that murder their children for dread of worldly shame? Certainly, such a one is called a horrible homicide. Homicide it is, also, if a man approach a woman by desire of lechery, through the accomplishing of which her child is killed in the womb, or strike a woman knowingly in such manner that she is caused to miscarry and lose her child. All these constitute homicide and are horrible mortal sins. Besides, there come from anger many more sins, as well of word as of thought and of deed; as he that arreteth upon God, or blameth God, of a thing of which he is himself guilty; or despiseth God and all his halwes, as do these cursed hasardours in diverse contrees. These cursed men do this when they feel in their hearts full wickedly of God and of His saints. Also, when they treat unreverently the sacrament of the altar, that sin is so great that unnethe may it be released, save that the mercy of God passeth all His works; it is so great and He so benigne.

Then cometh of Ire *angre*: when a man is sharply admonished in his shrifte to forleten his sinne, then will he be angry and answer scornfully and angrily, and defend or excuse his sinne by unstedfastness of his flesh; or else he did it to hold companye with his felawes, or else he seith, the fend enticed him; or else he did it for his youthe, or else his complexioun is so courageous, that he may not forbere; or else it is his destinee, as he seith, unto a certein age; or else he seith, it cometh him of gentillesse of his auncestres; and semblable thinges. Alle this manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir sinnes, that they ne wol nat delivere hem-self. For soothly, no wight that excuseth him wilfully of his sinne may nat been delivered of his sinne, til that he mekely biknoweth his sinne.

After this, thanne cometh swering, that is expres agayn the comandement of god; and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of Ire. God seith: “thou shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn or in ydel.” Also our lord Jesu Crist seith by the word of seint Mathew:

> *Nolite iurare omnino: ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere: neither by hevene, for it is goddes trone; ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his feet; ne by Jerusalem, for it is the citee of a greet king; ne by thyn heed, for thou mayst nat make an heer whit ne blak. But seyeth by youre word, ‘ye, ye,’ and ‘nay, nay’; and what that is more, it is of yvel.*  

For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so sinfully, in dismembringe of Crist by soule, herte, bones, and body. For certes, it semeth that ye thinke that the cursede Jewes ne dismembred nat y-nough the preciouse persone of Crist, but ye dismembre him more. And if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere, thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in youre swering, as seith Jeremye quarto capitulo, *Iurabis in veritate, in iudicio, et in iustitia:* “thou shalt kepe three condicions; thou shalt swere in trouthe, in doom, and in rightwisnesse.” This is to seyn, thou shalt swere sooth; for every lesinge is agayns Crist. For Crist is verray trouthe. And think wel this, that every greet swerere, nat compelled lawefully to swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his hous whyl he useth swich unlevcful swering.

Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe. Eek thou shalt nat swere for envye ne for favour, ne for mede, but for rightwisnesse; for declaracioun of it to the worship of god and helping of thyne evenecristene. And therfore, every man that taketh goddes name in ydel, or falsely swereth with his mouth, or elles taketh on him the name of Crist, to be called a Cristene man, and liveth nat in accordance with Cristes livinge and his techinge, alle they taken goddes name in ydel. Loke eek what seint Peter seith, *Actuum, quarto capitulo*: *Non est aliud nomen sub celo,* &c.: “Ther nis noon other name,” seith seint Peter, “under hevene, yeven to men, in which they mowe be saved”; that is to seyn, but the name of Jesu Crist. Take kepe eek how that the precious name of Crist, as seith seint Paul *ad Philippenses secundo*: *In nomine Jesu, &c.*: “that in the name of Jesu every knee of hevenely creatures, or erthely, or of helle, sholden bowe”; for it is so heigh and so worshipful, that the cursede feend in helle sholde tremblen to heren it y-nempned.

Thanne semeth it, that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed name, that they despyse him more boldly than dide the cursede Jewes, or elles the devel, that trembleth whan he hereth his name.

### 35.

Of Ire comen thise stinking engendrures: first hate, that is old wratthe; discord, thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he hath loved ful longe. And thanne cometh werre, and every manere of wrong that man dooth to his neighebore, in body or in catel. Of this cursed sinne of Ire cometh eek manslaughtre. And understonde wel, that homicyde, that is manslaughtre, is in dyverse wyse. Som manere of homicyde is spirituel, and som is bodily. Spirituel manslaughtre is in six thinges. First, by hate; as seint John seith, “he that hateth his brother is homicyde.” Homicyde is eek by bakbytinge; of whiche bakbyteres seith Salomon, that “they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hir neighbores.” For soothly, as wikke is to binime his good name as his lyf.

Homicyde is eek, in yevinge of wikked conseil by fraude; as for to yeven conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and taillages. Of whiche seith Salomon, “Leon rorynge and bere hongry been lyke to the cruel lordshipes,” in withholdinge or abregginge of the shepe (or the hyre), or of the wages of servaunts, or elles in usure or in withdrawinge of the almesse of povre folk. For which the wyse man seith, “fedeth him that almost dyeth for honger”; for soothly, but-if thou fede him, thou sleest him; and alle thise been deedly sinnes.

Bodily manslaughtre is, whan thou sleest him with thy tonge in other manere; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man, or elles yevest him conseil to sleen a man. Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres. That oon is by lawe; right as a justice dampneth him that is coupable to the deeth. But lat the justice be war that he do it rightfully, and that he do it nat for delyt to spille blood, but for kepinge of rightwisenesse. Another homicyde is, that is doon for necessitee, as whan o man sleeth another in his defendaunt, and that he ne may noon otherwise escape from his owene deeth. But certeinly, if he may escape withouten manslaughtre of his adversarie, and sleeth him, he doth sinne, and he shal bere penance as for deedly sinne. Eek if a man, by caas or aventure, shete an arwe or caste a stoon with which he sleeth a man, he is homicyde. Eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hir child in hir sleping, it is homicyde and deedly sinne.

Eek whan man destourbeth concepcion of a child, and maketh a womman outher bareyne by drinkinge venemouse herbes, thurgh which she may nat conceyve, or sleeth a child by drinkes wilfully, or elles putteth certeine material thinges in hir secree places to slee the child; or elles doth unkindely sinne, by which man or womman shedeth hir nature in manere or in place ther-as a child may nat be conceived; or elles, if a womman have conceyvcd and hurt hirself, and sleeth the child, yet is it homicyde. What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of worldly shame? Certes, an horrible homicyde. Homicyde is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherye, thurgh which the child is perissed, or elles smyteth a womman witingly, thurgh which she leseth hir child. Alle thise been homicydes and horrible deedly sinnes.

Yet comen ther of Ire manye mo sinnes, as wel in word as in thoght and in dede; as he that arretteth upon god, or blameth god, of thing of which he is himself gilty; or despyseth god and alle hise halwes, as doon thise cursede hasardours in diverse contrees. This cursed sinne doon they, whan they felen in hir hertes ful wikkedly of god and of hise halwes. Also, whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter, thilke sinne is so greet, that unnethe may it been relesed, but that the mercy of god passeth alle hise werkes; it is so greet and he so benigne.

Thanne comth of Ire attry angre; whan a man is sharply amoncsted in his shrifte to forleten his sinne, than wole he be angry and answeren hokerly and angrily, and deffenden or excusen his sinne by unstedefastnesse of his flesh; or elles he dide it for to holde companye with hise felawes, or elles, he seith, the fend entyced him; or elles he dide it for his youthe, or elles his complexioun is so corageous, that he may nat forbere; or elles it is his destinee, as he seith, unto a certein age; or elles, he seith, it cometh him of gentillesse of hise aunces- tres; and semblable thinges. Alle this manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir sinnes, that they ne wol nat delivere hem-self. For soothly, no wight that excuseth him wilfully of his sinne may nat been delivered of his sinne, til that he mekely biknoweth his sinne.

After this, thanne cometh swering, that is expres agayn the comandement of god; and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of Ire. God seith: “thou shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn or in ydel.” Also oure lord Jesu Crist seith by the word of seint Mathew:

> *Nolite iurare omnino: ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere; neither by hevene, for it is goddes trone; ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his feet; ne by Jerusalem, for it is the citee of a greet king; ne by thyn heed, for thou mayst nat make an heer whit ne blak. But seyeth by youre word, ‘ye, ye,’ and ‘nay, nay’; and what that is more, it is of yvel.*

For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so sinfully, in dismembringe of Crist by soule, herte, bones, and body. For certes, it semeth that ye thinke that the cursede Jewes ne dismembred nat y-nough the preciouse persone of Crist, but ye dismembre him more. And if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere, thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in youre swering, as seith Jeremye quarto capitulo, *Iurabis in veritate, in iudicio, et in iustitia*: “thou shalt kepe three condicions; thou shalt swere in trouthe, in doom, and in rightwisnesse.” This is to seyn, thou shalt swere sooth; for every lesinge is agayns Crist. For Crist is verray trouthe. And think wel this, that every greet swerere, nat compelled lawefully to swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his hous whyl he useth swich unlawful swering.

Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe. Eek thou shalt nat swere for envye ne for favour, ne for mede, but for rightwisnesse; for declaracioun of it to the worship of god and helping of thyne evenecristene. And therfore, every man that taketh goddes name in ydel, or falsly swereth with his mouth, or elles taketh on him the name of Crist, to be called a Cristene man, and liveth agayns Cristes livinge and his techinge, alle they taken goddes name in ydel. Loke eek what seint Peter seith, *Actuum, quarto capitulo*: *Non est aliud nomen sub celo,* &c. “Ther nis noon other name under hevene, yeven to men, in which they mowe be saved”; that is to seyn, but the name of Jesu Crist. Take kepe eek how that the precious name of Crist, as seith seint Paul *ad Philippenses secundo*: *In nomine Jesu, &c.*: “In the name of Jesus every knee of hevenely creatures, or erthely, or of helle, sholden bowe”; for it is so heigh and so worshipful, that the cursede feend in helle sholde tremblen to heren it y-nempned.

Thanne semeth it, that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed name, that they despyse him more boldely than dide the cursede Jewes, or elles the devel, that trembleth whan he hereth his name.

### 36.

Now certes, sith that swering, but-if it be lawefully doon, is so heighly deffended, muche worse is forswering falsly, and yet nedelees.

### 37.

What seye we eek of hem that delyten hem in swering, and holden it a gentrie or a manly dede to swere grete othes? And what of hem that, of verray usage, ne cesse nat to swere grete othes, al be the cause nat worth a straw? Certes, this is horrible sinne. Sweringe sodeynly with-oute avysement is eek a sinne. But lat us go now to thilke horrible swering of adjuracioun and conjuracioun, as doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in bacins ful of water, or in a bright swerd, in a cercle, or in a fyr, or in a shulder-boon of a sheep. I can nat seye but that they doon cursedly and damnably, agayns Crist and al the feith of holy chirche.

### 38.

What seye we of hem that bileven in divynailes, as by flight or by noyse of briddes, or of bestes, or by sort, by geomancie, by dremes, by chirkinge of dores, or crakkinge of houses, by gnawynge of rattes, and swich manere wrecchednesse? Certes, al this thing is deffended by god and by al holy chirche. For which they been acursed, til they come to amendement, that on swich filthe setten hir bileve. Charmes for woundes or maladye of men, or of bestes, if they taken any effect, it may be peraventure that god suffreth it, for folk sholden yeve the more feith and reverence to his name.

### 39.

Now wol I speken of lesinges, which generally is fals significacioun of word, in entente to deceyven his evenecristene. Som lesinge is of which ther comth noon avantage to no wight: and som lesinge turneth to the ese or profit of o man, and to disese and damage of another man. Another lesinge is for to saven his lyf or his catel. Another lesinge comth of delyt for to lye, in which delyt they wol forge a long tale, and peynten it with alle circumstaunces, where al the ground of the tale is fals. Som lesinge comth, for he wole sustene his word; and som lesinge comth of recchelesnesse, with-outen avysement; and semblable thinges.

### 40.

Lat us now touche the vyce of flateringe, which ne comth nat gladly but for drede or for coveitise. Flaterye is generally wrongful preisinge. Flatereres been the develes norices, that norissen his children with milk of losengerie. For sothe, Salomon seith, that *flaterie is wors than detraccion.* For som-tyme detraccion maketh an hauteyn man be the more humble, for he dredeth detraccion; but certes flaterye, that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his contenaunce. Flatereres been the develes enchauntours; for they make a man to wene of him-self be lyk that he nis nat lyk. They been lyk to Judas that bitraysed God; and thise flatereres bitraysen a man to sellen him to his enemy, that is, to the devel. Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that singen evere *Placebo.* I rekene flaterye in the vyces of Ire; for ofte tyme, if o man be wrooth with another, thanne wol he flatere som wight to sustene him in his querele.

# THE PARSON'S TALE

41. Speke we now of swich cursinge as comth
of irous herte. Malisoun generally may be seyd
every maner power of harm. Swich cursinge bireveth
man fro the regne of God, as seith seint Paul. And
ofte tyme swich cursinge wrongfully retorneth agayn
to him that curseth, as a brid that retorneth agayn
to his owene nest. And over alle thing men oghte
eschewe to cursen hir children, and yeven to the Devel
hir engendrure, as ferforth as in hem is; certes, it is
greet peril and greet sinne.

42. Lat us thanne speken of chydinge and reproche,
whiche been ful grete woundes in mannes herte; for
they unsowen the semes of frendshipe in mannes
herte. For certes, unnethes may a man pleynly been
accorded with him that hath him openly revyled
and repreved in disclaundre. This is a ful grisly sinne,
as Crist seith in the gospel. And tak kepe now, that
he that repreveth his neighebor, outher he repreveth
him by som harm of peyne that he hath on his body,
as “mesel,” “croked harlot,” or by som sinne that he dooth.
Now if he repreve him by harm of peyne, thanne
turneth the repreve to Jesu Crist; for peyne is sent
by the rightwys sonde of God, and by his suffrance,
be it meselrie, or maheym, or maladye. And if he repreve
him uncharitably of sinne, as, “thou holour,”
“thou dronkelewe harlot,” and so forth; thanne
aperteneth that to the rejoysinge of the Devel, that
evere hath joye that men doon sinne. And certes,
chydinge may nat come but out of a vileyns herte.
For after the habundance of the herte speketh the
mouth ful ofte. And ye shul understonde that loke,
by any wey, whan any man shal chastyse another,
that he be war from chydinge or reprevinge. For
trewely, but he be war, he may ful lightly quiken
the fyr of angre and of wratthe, which that he
sholde quenche, and per-aventure sleeth him which
that he mighte chastyse with benignitee. For as
seith Salomon, “the amiable tonge is the tree of
lyf,” that is to seyn, of lyf espirituel: and sothly, a
deslavee tonge sleeth the spirites of him that repreveth,
and eek of him that is repreved. Lo, what
seith seint Augustin: “ther is no-thing so lyk the
develes child as he that ofte chydeth.” Seint Paul
seith eek: “I, servant of God, bihove nat to chyde.”


Let us now touch upon the vice of flattering, which
comes not gladly from the heart, but for fear or for
covetousness. Flattery is generally unearned praise.
Flatterers are the Devil’s nurses, who nurse his children
with the milk of adulation. Forsooth, as Solomon says,
“Flattery is worse than detraction.” For sometimes
detraction causes a haughty man to be more humble,
for he fears detraction; but certainly flattery — that
causes a man to exalt his heart and his bearing.
Flatterers are the Devil’s enchanters, for they cause
a man to think of himself that he is like what he is
not like. They are like Judas who betrayed God; for
these flatterers betray a man in order to sell him out
to his enemy, that is, to the Devel. Flatterers are the
Devil’s chaplains, that continually sing *Placebo*. I
reckon flattery among the vices of anger; for oftentimes,
if one man be enraged at another, then will he
flatter some other to gain an ally in his quarrel.

Let us speak now of such cursing as comes from
an angry heart. Execration generally may be said
to embrace every kind of evil. Such cursing deprives a
man of the Kingdom of God, as says Saint Paul. And
oftentimes such cursing returns again upon the head
of him that curses, like a bird that returns again to
its own nest. And above all things men ought to eschew
the cursing of their children, and the giving to the
Devil of their progeny, so far as they may; certainly
it is a great danger and a great sin.

Let us now speak of chiding and reproaching,
which are great evils in man’s heart; for they rip up
the seams of friendship in man’s heart. For truly, a
man can hardly be reconciled with him that has
openly reviled and slandered him. This is a terrible
sin, as Christ says in the gospel. And note now that
he who reproaches his neighbour, either he reproaches
him for some painful evil that he has in his body,
as with “leper” or “hunchbacked scoundrel,” or by
some sin that he does. Now, if he reproach him for a
painful evil, then the reproach is turned upon Jesus
Christ; for pain is sent as the righteous sending of
God, and by His permission, be it of leprosy or malady
or bodily imperfection. And if he reproach him
uncharitably for sin, as with “you whoremonger,”
“you drunken scoundrel,” and so forth, then that
appertains to the rejoicing of the Devel, who is ever
rejoiced when men sin. And truly, chiding may not
come, save out of a sinful heart. For according to the
abundance of what is in the heart the mouth speaks.
And you shall understand that when any man would
correct another, let him beware of chydinge or reprevinge.
For truly, save he beware, he may easily quicken
the fire of anger and of wrath, which he should
quench, and perhaps will slay him whom he might
have corrected gently. For, as Solomon says, “the
amiable tongue is the tree of life,” which is to say,
of the spiritual life; and in sooth, a foul tongue
drains the vital forces of him that reproaches, and
also of him that is reproached. Behold what Saint
Augustine says: “There is nothing so like the Devil’s
child as he that chideth.” Saint Paul says, too: “The
servant of the Lord must not strive.” And though


## THE PARSON’S TALE

bickering be a sinful thing as between all kinds of
folk, certainly it is most unsuitable between a man
and his wife; for there is never rest there. Thereupon
Solomon says: “A continual dropping in a very
rainy day, and a contentious woman, are alike.” A
man who is in a house, the roof whereof leaks in
many places, though he avoid the dripping in one
place, it finds him in another; and so fares he who
has a chiding wife. If she cannot scold him in one
place, she will scold him in another. And therefore,
“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith,” says Solomon.
Saint Paul says: “Wives, submit yourselves unto
your husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands,
love your wives, and be not bitter against them.”
*Ad Colossenses, tertio.*

After that, let us speak of scorn, which is a wicked
sin; especially when one scorns a man for his good
works. For truly, such scorners are like the foul toad,
which cannot bear to smell the sweet odour of
the vine when it blossoms. These scorners are fellow-
partakers with the Devel; for they have joy when the
Devel wins, and sorrow when he loses. They are ad-
versaries of Jesu Crist; for they hate that which he
loveth, that is to say, the salvation of souls.

44. Speke we now of wikked conseil; for he that
wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour. For he deceyveth
him that trusteth in him, ut Achitofel ad Absalonem.
But natheless, yet is his wikked conseil first agayn
him-self. For, as seith the wyse man, every fals livinge
hath this propertee in him-self, that he that wole
anoye another man, he anoyeth first himself. And
men shul understonde, that man shal nat taken his
conseil of fals folk, ne of angry folk, or grevous folk,
ne of folk that loven specially to muchel hir owene
profit, ne to muche worldly folk, namely, in conseilinge
of soules.

45. Now comth the sinne of hem that sowen and
maken discord amonges folk, which is a sinne that
Crist hateth outrely; and no wonder is. For he
deyde for to make concord. And more shame do
they to Crist, than dide they that him crucifyede;
for God loveth bettre, that frendshipe be amonges
folk, than he dide his owene body, the which that
he yaf for unitee. Therfore been they lykned to the
devel, that evere been aboute to maken discord.

46. Now comth the sinne of double tonge;
swiche as speken faire bifore folk, and wikkedly
bihinde; or elles they maken semblant as though
they speke of good entencioun, or elles in game
and pley, and yet they speke of wikked entente.

47. Now comth biwreying of conseil, through
which a man is defamed; certes, unnethe may he
restore the damage.

Now comth manace, that is an open folye; for
he that ofte manaceth, he threateth more than he
may perfourme ful ofte tyme.

Now cometh ydel wordes, that is withouten
profit of him that speketh tho wordes, and eek of
him that herkneth tho wordes. Or elles ydel wordes
been tho that been nedelees, or with-outen entente
of naturel profit. And al-be-it that ydel wordes been
som tyme venial sinne, yet sholde men douten hem;
for we shul yeve rekeninge of hem bifore God.

Now comth janglinge, that may nat been with-
oute sinne. And, as seith Salomon, “it is a sinne of
apert folye.” And therfore a philosophre seyde,
whan men axed him how that men sholde plese
the peple; and he answerde, “do many gode werkes,
and spek fewe jangles.”

After this comth the sinne of japeres, that been
the develes apes; for they maken folk to laughe at
hir japerie, as folk doon at the gaudes of an ape.
Swiche japeres deffendeth seint Paul. Loke how
that vertuouse wordes and holy conforten hem
that travaillen in the service of Crist; right so con-
forten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of japeris
hem that travaillen in the service of the devel.
Thise been the sinnes that comen of the tonge,
that comen of Ire and of othere sinnes mo.

Here followeth the Remedy

48. The remedye agayns Ire is a vertu that men
clepen Mansuetude, that is Debonairetee; and eke
another vertu, that men callen Pacience or Suffrance.

49. Debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth
the stiringe and the moevynges of mannes corage
in his herte, in swich manere that they ne skippe
nat out by angre ne by Ire. Suffrance suffreth
swetely alle the anoyaunces and the wronges that
men dooen to man outward. Seint Jerome seith
thus of debonairetee, that “it doth noon harm to
no wight, ne seith; ne for noon harm that men
doon or seyn, he ne eschaufeth nat agayns his resoun.”
This vertu somtyme comth of nature; for, as seith
the philosophre, “a man is a quik thing, by nature
debonaire and tretable to goodnesse; but whan
debonairetee is enformed of grace, thanne is it
the more worth.”

50. Pacience, that is another remedye agayns
Ire, is a vertu that suffreth swetely every mannes
goodnesse, and is nat wrooth for noon harm that
is doon to him. The philosophre seith, that “pacience
is thilke vertu that suffreth debonairely alle
the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word.”
This vertu maketh a man lyk to God, and maketh
him Goddes owene dere child, as seith Crist. This
vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy. And therfore seith
the wyse man, “if thou wolt venquisse thyn ene-
my, lerne to suffre.” And thou shalt understonde,
that man suffreth foure manere of grevances in
outward thinges, agayns the whiche foure he moot
have foure manere of paciences.

51. The firste grevance is of wikkede wordes;
thilke suffrede Jesu Crist withouten grucching, ful
paciently, whan the Jewes despysed and repreved
him ful ofte. Suffre thou therfore paciently; for
the wyse man seith: “if thou stryve with a fool,
though the fool be wrooth or though he laughe,
algate thou shalt have no reste.” That other grev-
ance outward is to have damage of thy catel. There-
agayns suffred Crist ful paciently, whan he was
despoyled of al that he hadde in this lyf, and that
was but his clothes. The thridde grevance is a
man to have harm in his body. That suffred Crist
ful paciently in al his passioun. The fourthe grev-
ance is in outrageous labour in werkes. Wherfore
I seye, that folk that maken hir servants to travail-
len to grevously, or out of tyme, as on halydayes,
soothly they do greet sinne. Heer-agayns suffred
Crist ful paciently, and taughte us pacience, whan
he bar upon his blissed shulder the croys, upon
which he sholde suffren despitous deth. Heer
may men leme to be pacient; for certes, noght
only Cristen men been pacient for love of Jesu
Crist, and for guerdoun of the blisful lyf that is
perdurable; but certes, the olde payens, that nevere
were Cristene, commendeden and useden the
vertu of pacience.

52. A philosophre upon a tyme, that wolde
have beten his disciple for his grete trespas, for
which he was greetly amoeved, and broghte a
yerde to scourge the child; and whan this child
saugh the yerde, he seyde to his maister, “what
thenke ye to do?” “I wol bete thee,” quod the
maister, “for thy correccion.” “For sothe,” quod
the child, “ye oughten first correcte youre-self, that
han lost al youre pacience for the gilt of a child.”
“For sothe,” quod the maister al wepinge, “thou
seyst sooth; have thou the yerde, my dere sone,
and correcte me for myn impatience.” Of Pacience
comth Obedience, through which a man is obedient
to Crist and to alle hem to whiche he oghte to been
obedient in Crist. And understond wel that obe-
dience is perfit, whan that a man doth gladly and
hastily, with good herte entierly, al that he sholde
do. Obedience generally, is to perfourne the doct-
rine of God and of his sovereyns, to whiche him
oghte to ben obeisaunt in alle rightwysnesse.

Against the Sin of Wrath

Let us now turn to the sins of wrath and their remedy.
The remedy for anger is a virtue which men clepen
mansuetude, that is gentleness; and eke another
virtue, that men call patience or suffrance.

Gentleness withdraweth and refraineth the stirs and
the movings of a man’s courage in his heart in such
manner that they ne leap out by anger nor by ire.
Sufferance suffereth sweetly all the annoyances and
the wrongs that men do to man outwardly. Saint
Jerome saith thus of gentleness, that “it doth no harm
to no wight, nor saith harm; nor for no harm that
men do or say, he ne chafeth against his reason.”
This virtue sometimes cometh of nature; for, as seith
the philosopher, “a man is quick by nature, gentle
and tractable to goodness; but when gentleness is
enformed of grace, then is it the more worth.”

Patience, that is another remedy against ire, is a
virtue that suffereth sweetly all manner of hurt and
is not wroth for harm that is done to him. The
philosopher saith, “patience is that virtue which
suffereth meekly all the outrages of adversity and
every wicked word.” This virtue maketh a man like
to God, and maketh him God’s own dear child, as
Christ saith. This virtue discomfiteth thy enemy.
And therefore saith the wise man, “If thou wilt
vanquish thy enemy, learn to suffer.” And thou
shalt understand that man suffereth four manner
of grievances in outward things, against which four
he must have four manner of patiences.

The first grievance is of wicked words; this Christ
suffered without grumbling, full patiently, when the
Jews despised and reproved him full oft. Suffer thou
therefore patiently; for the wise man saith: “If thou
strive with a fool, though the fool be wroth or though
he laugh, yet shalt thou have no rest.” That other
outward grievance is to have damage of thy chattels.
Thereagainst suffered Christ full patiently, when he was
despoiled of all that he had in this life, and that was
but his clothes. The third grievance is to suffer harm
in the body. That Christ suffered full patiently in
all his passion. The fourth grievance is in outrageous
labour in works. Wherefore I say that folk that make
their servants to travail grievously, or out of time,
as on holydays, truly they do great sin. Hereagainst
suffered Christ full patiently, and taught us patience,
when he bore upon his blessed shoulder the cross
upon which he should suffer despiteous death. Here
may men learn to be patient; for certainly not only
Christian men are patient for love of Jesu Christ, and
for reward of the blissful life perdurable; but certainly
the old pagans, that never were Christians, commended
and used the virtue of patience.

Here followeth Sloth

53. After the sinnes of Envie and of Ire, now
wol I speken of the sinne of Accidie. For Envie
blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire troubleth a
man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful,
and wrawe. Envie and Ire maken bitternesse in
herte; which bitternesse is moder of Accidie, and
binnimeth him the love of alle goodnesse. Thanne
is Accidie the anguissh of a trouble herte; and
seint Augustin seith: “it is anoy of goodnesse and
joye of harm.” Certes, this is a dampnable sinne;
for it doth wrong to Jesu Crist, in-as-muche as it
binnimeth the service that men oghte doon to Crist
with alle diligence, as seith Salomon. But Accidie
dooth no swich diligence; he dooth alle thing with
anoy, and with wrawnnesse, slaknesse, and excusa-
cioun, and with ydelnesse and unlust, for which
the book seith: “acursed be he that doth the service
of God negligently.” Thanne is Accidie enemy
to everich estaat of man; for certes, the estaat of
man is in three maneres. Outher it is th’estaat of
innocence, as was th’estaat of Adam bifore that
he fil into sinne; in which estaat he was holden to
wirche, as in heryinge and adouringe of God. An-
other estaat is th’estaat of sinful men, in which
estaat men been holden to laboure in preyinge to
God for amendement of hir sinnes, and that he
wol graunte hem to arisen out of hir sinnes. An-
other estaat is th’estaat of grace, in which estaat
he is holden to werkes of penitence; and certes, to
alle thise thinges Accidie is enemy and contrarie.
For he loveth no bisinesse at al. Now certes, this
foule sinne Accidie is eek a ful greet enemy to the
lyflode of the body; for it ne hath no purveaunce
agayns temporel necessitee; for it forsleweth and
forsluggeth, and destroyeth alle goodes temporeles
by reccheleesnesse.

54. The fourthe thinge is, that Accidie is lyk to
hem that been in the peyne of helle, bycause of
hir slouthe and of hir hevinesse; for they that been
dampned been so bounde, that they ne may neith-
er wel do ne wel thinke. Of Accidie comth first,
that a man is anoyed and encumbred for to doon
any goodnesse, and maketh that God hath abhomina-
cion of swich Accidie, as seith seint Johan.

55. Now comth Slouthe, that wol nat suffre
noon hardnesse ne no penaunce. For soothly,
Slouthe is so tendre, and so delicat, as seith Salomon,
that he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce,
and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth. Agayns
this roten-herted sinne of Accidie and Slouthe sholde
men exercise hem-self to doon gode werkes, and
manly and vertuously cacchen corage wel to doon;
thinkinge that oure Lord Jesu Crist quiteth every
good dede, be it never so lyte. Usage of labour is a
greet thing; for it maketh, as seith seint Bernard, the
laborer to have stronge armes and harde sinwes; and
Slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre. Thanne comth
drede to biginne to werke any gode werkes; for
certes, he that is enclyned to sinne, him thinketh
it is so greet an empryse for to undertake to doon
werkes of goodnesse, and casteth in his herte that
the circumstaunces of goodnesse been so grevouse and
so chargeaunt for to suffre, that he dar nat undertake
to do werkes of goodnesse, as seith seint Gregorie.

56. Now comth wanhope, that is despeir of the
mercy of God, that comth somtyme of to muche
outrageous sorwe, and somtyme of to muche drede:
imagininge that he hath doon so muche sinne, that
it wol nat availlen him, though he wolde repenten
him and forsake sinne: through which despeir or
drede he abaudoneth al his herte to every maner
sinne, as seith seint Augustin. Which dampnable
sinne, if that it continue unto his ende, it is cleped
sinning in the holy gost. This horrible sinne is so
perilous, that he that is despeired, ther nis no felonye
ne no sinne that he douteth for to do; as shewed
wel by Judas. Certes, aboven alle sinnes thanne
is this sinne most displesant to Crist, and most
adversarie. Soothly, he that despeireth him is lyk
the coward chaumpioun recreant, that seith creant
withoute nede. Allas! alse! nedelees is he

(which state he was maintained to praise and adore
his God). Another state is the condition of sinful men
wherein they are obliged to labour in praying to
God for the amendment of their sins. Another state
is the condition of grace, in which condition man is
bound to acts of penitence; and truly, to all these
things acedia is the enemy and the opposite. For it
loves no busyness at all. Now certainly this foul sin
of acedia is also a great enemy to the livelihood of
the body; for it makes no provision for temporal
necessity; for it wastes, and it allows things to spoil,
and it destroys all worldly goods by carelessness.

The fourth thing is that acedia is like those who
are in the pain of Hell, because of their sloth and
their heaviness; for they that are damned are so bound,
that they may neither well do nor well think. From
acedia cometh first that a man is annoyed and encumbered
to do any goodness, and it maketh that God hath
abomination of such acedia, as Saint John saith.

Now cometh Sloth, that will not suffer any hardship
nor any penance. For soothly, Sloth is so tender and
so delicate, as Solomon saith, that he will not suffer
any hardness nor penance, and therefore he spoileth
all that he dooth. Against this rotten-hearted sin of
acedia and sloth should men exercise themselves to do
good works, and manfully and virtuously take courage
to do well, thinking that our Lord Jesu Christ rewardeth
every good deed, be it never so little. Use of labour is
a great thing; for it maketh, as Saint Bernard saith,
the laborer to have strong arms and hard sinews; and
sloth maketh them feeble and tender. Then cometh
dread to begin to work any good works; for certes,
he that is inclined to sin, him thinketh it is so great an
enterprise to undertake to do works of goodness, and
he casteth in his heart that the circumstances of goodness
are so grievous and so chargeable to suffer, that he
dare not undertake to do works of goodness, as saith
Saint Gregory.

Now cometh wanhope, that is despair of the mercy
of God, that cometh sometimes of too much outrageous
sorrow, and sometimes of too much dread: imagining
that he hath done so much sin, that it will not avail him,
though he would repent him and forsake sin: through
which despair or dread he abandoneth all his heart to
every manner of sin, as saith Saint Augustine. Which
damnable sin, if that it continue unto his end, it is
cleped sinning in the Holy Ghost. This horrible sin is so
perilous, that he that is desperate, there is no felony
nor no sin that he douteth for to do; as shewed well
by Judas. Certainly, above all sins then is this sin most
displeasing to Christ, and most adversary. Soothly, he
that despaireth him is like the coward champion recreant,
that crieth *creant* without need. Alack! alas! needless is he.

# THE PARSON'S TALE

## The Remedy against the Sin of Sloth

Remembering that Our Lord Jesus Christ rewards every good deed, be it ever so little. The habit of labour is a great thing; for, as Saint Bernard says, it gives the labourer strong arms and hard thews, whereas sloth makes them feeble and tender. Then arises the dread of beginning to do any good deeds; for certainly he that is inclined toward sin thinks it is so great an enterprise to start any works of goodness, and tells himself in his heart that the circumstances having to do with goodness are so wearisome and burdensome to endure, that he dare not undertake any such works, as Saint Gregory says.

Now enters despair, which is despair of the mercy of God, and comes sometimes of too extravagant sorrows and sometimes of too great fear: for the victim imagines that he has done so much sin that it will avail him not to repent and forgo sin; because of which fear he abandons his heart to every kind of sin, as Saint Augustine says. This damnable sin, if it be indulged to the end, is called sinning in the Holy Ghost. This horrible sin is so dangerous that he that is so desperate hesitates to do no felony or sin; as was well showed by Judas. Certainly, then, above all other sins, this sin is most displeasing to Christ, and most hateful. Truly he that grows so desperate is like the cowardly and recreant combatant that yields before he is beaten, and when there is no need. Alas, alas! Needlessly is he recreant and needlessly in despair. Certainly the mercy of God is always available to every penitent, and this is the greatest of all God’s works. Alas! Cannot a man bethink him of the gospel of Saint Luke, chapter 15, wherein Christ says:

> “There shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.”

Behold further, in the same gospel, the joy and the feast given by the good man who had lost his son when his son, repentant, returned to his father. Can they not remember, also, that, as Saint Luke says (chapter xxiii), the thief who was hanged beside Jesus Christ said: “Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.” “Verily,” said Christ, “I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.” Certainly there is no such horrible sin of man that it may not, in his lifetime, be destroyed by penitence, by virtue of the passion and the death of Jesus Christ. Alas! Why then need a man despair, since mercy is so ready and so great? Ask, and it shall be given unto you.

Then enters somnolence, that is to say sluggish slumbering, which makes a man heavy and dull in body and in soul; and this sin comes from sloth. And truly, the time that a man should not sleep, in all reason, is the early morning, unless there be a reasonable necessity. For verily the morningtide is most suitable for a man to say his prayers, and to meditate on God and to honour God, and to give alms to the poor person who first asks in the name of Christ. Behold what Solomon says: “Whoso would awake in the dawn and seek me, he shall find me.”

Then enters negligence, or carelessness, that recks of nothing. And if ignorance is the mother of all evil, certainly then negligence is the nurse. Negligence cares not, when it must do a thing, whether it be well done or badly.

As to the remedies for these two sins, as the wise man says: “He that fears God spares not to do that which he ought.” And he that loves God will be diligent to please God by his works, and will exert himself, with all his might, to do well. Then enters idleness, which is the gate to all evils. An idle man is like a house that has no walls; the devils may enter on every side and shoot at him, he being thus unprotected, and tempt him on every side. This idleness is the sink of all wicked and villainous thoughts, and of all idle chattering and trifles, and of all filthiness. Certainly Heaven is for those that labour, and not for idle folk. Also David says: “They are not among the harvest of men and they shall not be threshed with men,” which is to say, in Purgatory. Certainly, then, it appears that they shall be tormented by the Devil in Hell, unless they soon repent.

Then enters the sin that men call tarditas, which is when a man is too tardy or too long-tarrying before he turns unto God; and certainly this is a great folly. He is like one that falls in the ditch and will not arise. And this vice comes of a false hope whereby a man comes to think that he shall live long; but that hope fails him full often.

Then comes laziness; that is, he that when he beginneth any good work anon forgoeth it and holdeth off; as do those that have any person to govern and take no care of him as soon as they find any contrary or any annoyance. These are the new shepherds that let their sheep willingly run to the wolf that is in the briers, or do no care of their own governance. Of this cometh poverty and destruction, both of spiritual and temporal things. Then cometh a kind of coldness that frets all the heart of man. Then cometh lack of devotion, through which a man is so blinded, as Saint Bernard says, and hath such languor in soul that he may neither read nor sing in holy church, neither hear nor think of any devotion, nor travail with his hands in any good work, but it is unsavory and all appalled to him. Then he waxeth slow and slumbery, and anon will be wroth, and soon is inclined to hate and to envy. Then cometh the sin of worldly sorrow, such as is called *tristitia*, which slayeth man, as Saint Paul saith. For surely such sorrow worketh to the death of the soul and of the body also; for thereof it cometh that a man is annoyed of his own life. Wherefore such sorrow often shortens the life of a man before that his time be come by way of kind.

### Against Acedia

Against this horrible sin of *acedia*, and the branches thereof, there is a virtue that is called *fortitudo* or strength; that is, an affection whereby a man despises annoying things. This virtue is so mighty and so vigorous that it dares to withstand mightily and wisely keep itself from perils that are wicked, and wrestle against the assaults of the Devil. For it enhanceth and enforceth the soul, just as *acedia* abateth it and maketh it feeble. For this *fortitudo* may endure by long sufferance the travails that be convenient.

This virtue hath many species; and the first is called Magnanimity, that is to say, great courage. For certainly there behoveth great courage against *acedia*, lest it swallow the soul by the sin of sorrow or destroy it by despair. This virtue maketh folk to undertake hard and grievous things by their own will, wisely and reasonably. And for as much as the Devil fighteth against a man more by craft and sleight than by strength, therefore men shall withstand him by wit and by reason and by discretion. Then are there the virtues of faith and of hope in God and in His saints, to achieve and accomplish the good works in which one purposeth firmly to continue. Then cometh security or certitude; and that is when a man doubts not concerning future reward of the good works that he hath begun. Then cometh magnificence, that is to say, when a man doth and performeth great works of goodness that he hath begun; and that is the end for which men should do good works, for in the accomplishing of great good works lieth the great reward. Then is there constancy, that is, stability of courage; and this should be in heart by steadfast faith, and in mouth, and in bearing, and in work and in deed. Also there be more special remedies against *acedia*, in diverse works and in consideration of the pains of Hell and the joys of Heaven, and in trust in the grace of the Holy Ghost that will give a man might to perform his good intent.

## Here followeth Avarice

After *acedia* I will speak of avarice and of covetousness, of which sin Saint Paul says that “the love of money is the root of all evil” (1 Timothy 6:10). For verily, when the heart of a man is confounded within itself and troubled, and when the soul hath lost the comforting of God, then seeketh a man a vain solace in worldly things.

Avarice, according to the description of Saint Augustine, is the eagerness of the heart to have earthly things. Others say that avarice is the desire to acquire earthly goods and give nothing to those that need. And understand that avarice consists not only in greed for land and chattels, but sometimes for learning and for glory, and for every kind of immoderate thing. And the difference between avarice and covetousness is this: covetousness is to covet such things as one hath not; and avarice is to keep and withhold such things as one hath when there is no need to do so. Truly this avarice is a sin that is very damnable; for all holy writ condemns it and inveighs against that vice; for it doeth wrong to Jesus Christ. For it bereaveth Him of the love that men owe to Him and turneth it backward against all reason; and it causeth that an avaricious man hath more hope in his chattels than in Jesus Christ and is more diligent in the guarding and keeping of his treasure than in the service of Jesus Christ. And therefore Saint Paul says (Ephesians 5:5) that “no covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.”

What difference is there between an idolater and an avaricious man, save that an idolater, peradventure, hath but one idol and the avaricious man hath many? For verily every florin in his coffer is his idol. And certainly the sin of idolatry is the first thing that God forbids in the Ten Commandments, as witness Exodus 20: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me; thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.” Thus an avaricious man, who loveth his treasure more than God, is an idolater by reason of this cursed sin of avarice.

Of covetousness come these hard exactions whereby men are assessed and made to pay taxes, rents, and payments in lieu of service, more than duty requires or reason demands. Also they take from their serfs amercements that might more reasonably be called extortions than amercements. As to which amercements and fines of serfs, some lords’ stewards say that it is just, forasmuch as a churl hath no temporal thing that is not his lord’s, so they say. But certainly these lordships do wrong that bereave their bond-folk of things that they never gave them (Augustinus, De Civitate Dei, Book IX). Sooth is that the condition of thraldom and the first cause of thraldom is sin (Genesis 9).

Thus may ye see that the guilt deserveth thraldom, but not nature. Wherefore these lords should not much glorify themselves in their lordships, since by natural condition they are not lords of thralls; but for that thraldom came first by the desert of sin. And furthermore, where the law saith that temporal goods of bondmen be the goods of their lord, ye, that is to say, it is to be understood as the goods of the emperor, to defend them in their right, but not to rob them nor to reave them. And therefore says Seneca: “Thy prudence should live benignly with thy thralls.” Those that thou clepest thy thralls are God’s people; for humble folk be Christ’s friends; they be at home with the Lord.

Think also that of such seed as churls spring, of such seed spring lords. As well may the churl be saved as the lord. The same death that taketh the churl taketh the lord. Wherefore I rede, do right so with thy churl as thou wouldest that thy lord did with thee, if thou were in his plight. Every sinful man is a churl to sin. I rede thee, certes, that thou, lord, work in such wise with thy churls that they rather love thee than dread. I wot well there is degree above degree, as reason is; and it is right that men do their devoir where it is due; but certes, extortions and despite of your underlings is damnable.

And furthermore understand well that these conquerors or tyrants make full oft thralls of them that were born of as royal blood as they that conquer them. This name of thraldom was never erst known until Noah said that his son Canaan should be thrall to his brethren for his sin. What say we then of them that pill and do extortions to holy church? Certainly the sword that men give first to a knight when he is newly dubbed signifieth that he should defend holy church, and not rob nor pillage it; and who so doth, is traitor to Christ. And, as Saint Augustine says, “they are the Devil’s wolves that strangle the sheep of Jesus Christ”; and do worse than wolves. For truly when the wolf hath filled his womb he ceaseth to strangle sheep. But certes the pillers and destroyers of God’s holy church do not so; for they never cease to pill. Now, as I have said, since sin was the first cause of thraldom, then was it thus that the time when all the world was in sin, the world was in thraldom and subjection. But certainly, since the time of grace came, God ordained that some folk should be more high in estate and in degree, and some folk more low, and that each should

> 57. Of the remedie of thise two sinnes, as seith the wyse man, that “he that dredeth God, he spareth nat to doon that which him oghte doon.” And he that loveth God, he wol doon diligence to plese God by his werkes, and abaundone himself, with al his might, wel for to doon. Thanne comth idelnesse, that is the gate of alle harmes. An idel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles; the develes may entre on every side and sheten at him at discovert, by temptacion on every side. This idelnesse is the thurrok of alle wicked and vileyns thoghtes, and of alle jangles, trifles, and of alle ordure. Certes the hevene is yeven to hem that wol labouren, and nat to idel folk. Eek David seith that “they ne been nat in the labour of men, ne they shul nat been whipped with men,” that is to seyn, in Purgatorie. Certes thanne semeth it, they shul be tormented with the devel in helle, but-if they doon penance.

> 58. Thanne comth the sinne that men clepen Tarditas, as whan a man is to latiede or taryinge er he wole turne to God; and certes, that is a greet folye. He is lyk to him that falleth in the diche, and wol nat arise. And this vice comth of a fals hope, that he thinketh that he shal live longe; but that hope faileth ful ofte.

> 59. Thanne comth Lachesse; that is he, that whan he biginneth any good werk, anon he shal forleten it and stinten; as doon they that han any wight to governe, and ne taken of him na-more kepe, anon as they finden any contrarie or any annoy. Thise been the newe shepherdes, that leten hir sheep witingly go renne to the wolf that is in the breres, or do no fors of hir owene governaunce. Of this comth poverte and destruccioun, bothe of spirituel and temporel thinges. Thanne comth a manere coldnesse, that freseth al the herte of man. Thanne comth undevocioun, thurgh which a man is so blent, as seith seint Bernard, and hath swiche langour in soule, that he may neither rede ne singe in holy chirche, ne here ne thinke of no devocioun, ne travaille with hise handes in no good werk, that it nis him unsavory and al apalled. Thanne wexeth he slow and slombry, and sone wol be wrooth, and sone is enclyned to hate and to envie. Thanne comth the sinne of worldly sorwe, swich as is cleped tristitia, that sleeth man, as seint Paul seith. For certes, swich sorwe werketh to the deeth of the soule and of the body also; for therof comth, that a man is anoyed of his owene lyf. Wherefore swich sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lyf of a man, er that his tyme be come by wey of kinde.

> 60. Agayns this horrible sinne of Accidie, and the branches of the same, ther is a vertu that is called Fortitudo or Strength; that is, an affeccion thurgh which a man despiseth anoyous thinges. This vertu is so mighty and so vigorous, that it dar withstande mightily and wysely kepen himself fro perils that been wikked, and wrastle agayn the assautes of the devel. For it enhaunceth and enforceth the soule, right as Accidie abateth it and maketh it feble. For this Fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that been covenable.

> 61. This vertu hath manye speces; and the firste is cleped Magnanimitee, that is to seyn, greet corage. For certes, ther bihoveth greet corage agains Accidie, lest that it ne swolwe the soule by the sinne of sorwe, or destroye it by wanhope. This vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thinges and grevouse thinges, by hir owene wil, wysely and resonably. And for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man more by queyntise and by sleighte than by strengthe, therfore men shal withstanden him by wit and by resoun and by discrecion. Thanne am ther the vertues of feith, and hope in God and in his seintes, to acheve and acomplice the gode werkes in the whiche he purposeth fermely to continue. Thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse; and that is, whan a man ne douteth no travail in tyme cominge of the gode werkes that a man hath bigonne. Thanne comth Magnificence, that is to seyn, whan a man dooth and perfoumeth grete werkes of goodnesse that he hath bigonne; and that is the ende why that men sholde do gode werkes; for in the acomplissinge of grete gode werkes lyeth the grete guerdoun. Thanne is ther Constaunce, that is, stablencsse of corage; and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith, and in mouth, and in beringe, and in chere and in dede. Eke ther been mo speciale remedies agayns Accidie, in diverse werkes, and in consideracioun of the peynes of helle, and of the joyes of hevene, and in trust of the grace of the holy goost, that wol yeve him might to perfoume his gode entente.

> 62. After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice and of Coveitise, of which sinne seith seint Paule, that “the rote of alle harmes is Coveitise”: Ad Timotheum, sexto capitulo. For soothly, whan the herte of a man is confounded in it-self and troubled, and that the soule hath lost the confort of God, thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thinges.

> 63. Avarice, after the descripcion of seint Augustin, is likerousnesse in herte to have erthely thinges. Som other folk seyn, that Avarice is, for to purchacen manye erthely thinges, and nothing yeve to hem that han nede. And understond, that Avarice ne stant nat only in lond ne catel, but somtyme in science and in glorie, and in every manere of outrageous thing is Avarice and Coveitise. And the difference bitwixe Avarice and Coveitise is this. Coveitise is for to coveite swiche thinges as thou hast nat; and Avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thinges as thou hast, with-oute rightful nede. Soothly, this Avarice is a sinne that is ful dampnable; for al holy writ curseth it, and speketh agayns that vice; for it dooth wrong to Jesu Crist. For it bireveth him the love that men to him owen, and turneth bakward agayns alle resoun; and maketh that the avaricious man hath more hope in his catel than in Jesu Crist, and dooth more observance in kepinge of his tresor than he dooth to service of Jesu Crist. And therfore seith seint Paule ad Ephesios, quinto, that “an avaricious man is in the thraldom of idolatrie.”

> 64. What difference is bitwixe an idolastre and an avaricious man, but that an idolastre, per aventure, ne hath but o mawmet or two, and the avaricious man hath manye? For certes, every florin in his cofre is his mawmet. And certes, the sinne of Mawmetrye is the firste thing that God deffended in the ten comaundments, as bereth witnesse Exodi, capitulo xx°: “Thou shalt have no false goddes bifore me, ne thou shalt make to thee no grave thing.” Thus is an avaricious man, that loveth his tresor bifore God, an idolastre, thurgh this cursed sinne of Avarice. Of Coveitise comen these harde lordshipes, thurgh whiche men been distreyned by tailages, custumes, and cariages, more than hir dutee or resoun is. And eke they taken of hir bonde-men amerciments, whiche mighten more resonably ben eleped extorcions than amerciments. Of whiche amerciments and raunsoninges of bonde- men, somme lordes’ stewardes seyn, that it is rightful; for-as-muche-as a churl hath no temporel thing that it ne is his lordes, as they seyn. But certes, these lordshipes doon wrong, that bireven hir bonde-folk thinges that they never yave hem: Augustinus, De Civitate Dei, libro nono. Sooth is, that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste cause of thraldom is for sinne; Genesis, ix.

> 65. Thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom, but nat nature. Wherfore these lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifyen hem in hir lord- ships, sith that by naturel condicion they been nat lordes of thralles; but for that thraldom comth first by the desert of sinne. And forther-over, ther-as the lawe seith, that temporel godes of bonde-folk been the godes of hir lordshipes, ye, that is for to understonde, the godes of the emperour, to deffenden hem in hir right, but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem. And therfore seith Seneca: “Thy prudence sholde live benignely with thy thralles.” Thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple; for humble folk been Cristes freendes; they been contubernial with the lord.

> 66. Think eek, that of swich seed as cherles springeth, of swich seed springen lordes. As wel may the cherl be saved as the lord. The same deeth that taketh the cherl, swich deeth taketh the lord. Wherfore I rede, do right so with thy cherl, as thou woldest that thy lord dide with thee, if thou were in his plyt. Every sinful man is a cherl to sinne. I rede thee, certes, that thou, lord, werke in swiche wyse with thy cherles, that they rather love thee than drede. I woot wel ther is degree above degree, as reson is; and skile it is, that men do hir devoir ther-as it is due; but certes, extorcions and despite of youre underlinges is dampnable.

> 67. And forther-over understond wel, that these conquerours or tiraunts maken ful ofte thralles of hem, that been born of as royal blood as been they that hem conqueren. This name of thraldom was never erst couth, til that Noe seyde, that his sone Canaan sholde be thral to his bretheren for his sinne. What seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions to holy chirche? Certes, the swerd, that men yeven first to a knight whan he is newe dubbed, signifyeth that he sholde deffenden holy chirche, and nat robben it ne pilen it; and who so dooth, is traitour to Crist. And, as seith seint Augustin, “they been the develes wolves, that strangle the sheep of Jesu Crist”; and doon worse than wolves. For soothly, whan the wolf hath ful his wombe, he stinteth to strangle sheep. But soothly, the pilours and destroyours of goddes holy chirche ne do nat so; for they ne stint nevere to pile. Now, as I have seyd, sith so is that sinne was first cause of thraldom, thanne is it thus; that thilke tyme that al this world was in sinne, thanne was al this world in thraldom and subjeccioun. But certes, sith the tyme of grace cam, God ordeyned that som folk sholde be more heigh in estaat and in degree, and som folk more lowe, and that everich sholde

# THE PARSON’S TALE

## Simony and Spiritual Trade

There are permitted trades by which merchants may bring merchandise from one country to another. That other trade, which men barter with fraud and treachery and deceit, with lies and with false oaths, is accursed and damnable. Spiritual trade is properly *simony* — the earnest desire to buy spiritual things, that is to say, things that appertain to the sanctuary of God and to the cure of the soul. This desire, if a man is diligent in accomplishing it, even though his desire have no effect, yet it is a deadly sin; and if he be ordained he sins against his orders.

Simony is named for Simon Magus, who would have bought, with temporal wealth, the gift that God had given, by the Holy Ghost, to Saint Peter and to the other apostles. And therefore you should understand that both he that buys and he that sells spiritual things are called simonists; be it by means of chattels, or by entreaty, or by fleshly asking of his friends — fleshly friends or spiritual friends. Fleshly friends are of two kinds: kindred and other friends.

Truly, if they ask for one who is not worthy and able, it is simony if he take the benefice; but if he be worthy and able, it is not. The other kind is when a man or woman asks folk to advance him or her only for wicked fleshly affection that they may have for that person; and that is vile simony. But certainly, in that service for which men give spiritual things unto their servants, it must be understood that the service is honest; and also that it be done without bargaining, and that the person be able.

For, as Saint Damasus says:  
> “All the sins of the world, compared to this sin, are as naught.”

For it is the greatest sin that may be done after that of Lucifer and Antichrist. For by this sin God loses the Church and the soul that He bought with His precious blood, because of those who give churches to those who are not worthy. For they put in thieves, who steal souls from Jesus Christ and destroy His patrimony. By reason of such unworthy priests and curates, ignorant men have the less reverence for the sacraments of Holy Church; and such givers of churches put out the children of Christ and put in the Devil’s own sons. They sell the souls that they watch over as lambs to the wolf that rends them. And therefore they shall never have any part in the pasture of lambs, that is, the bliss of Heaven.

Now comes hazardry with its appurtenances, such as tables and raffles, whence come deceit, false oaths, chidings, and hatred of one’s neighbours, waste of goods, misspending of time, and sometimes manslaughter. Certainly, hazarders cannot be without great sin while they haunt that craft. Of avarice come also lies, theft, false witnessing, and false oaths. And you shall understand that these are great sins, and expressly against the commandments of God, as I have said.

False witness is in word and also in deed. In word, as by bereaving thy neighbour’s good name by thy false witnessing, or bereaving him of his chattels or his heritage by thy false witnessing; when thou, for ire or for reward, or for envy, bearest false witness, or accusest him or excusest him by thy false witness, or else excusest thyself falsely. Beware, you jurymen and notaries! Certainly, by false witness was Susanna in full great sorrow and pain, and many another more.

The sin of theft is also expressly against God’s commandment, and that in two manners, corporal and spiritual. Corporal, as taking thy neighbour’s chattels against his will, be it by force or by sleight, be it by short measure or by false measure; by stealing also of false indictments upon him, and in borrowing of thy neighbour’s chattels in intent never to pay them again, and similar things. Spiritual theft is sacrilege, that is to say, hurting of holy things, or of things sacred to Christ, in two manners: by reason of the holy place, as churches or churchyards, for which every vile sin that men do in such places may be called sacrilege, or every violence in such places; and also they that withdraw falsely the rights that belong to Holy Church.

And plainly and generally, sacrilege is to take away a holy thing from a holy place, or an unholy thing out of a holy place, or a holy thing out of an unholy place.

## The Relief against the Sin of Avarice

68. Now shall you understand that the relief of avarice is *misericorde* and pity, largely taken. And men might ask why mercy and pity relieve avarice. Certainly, the avaricious man shows no pity nor any mercy to the needy man; for he delights in keeping his treasure and not in the rescuing or relieving of his fellow Christian. And therefore will I speak first of mercy.

Mercy, as the philosopher says, is a virtue whereby the feelings of a man are moved by the trouble of him that is in distress. Upon which mercy follows pity and performs charitable works of mercy. And certainly, these things impel a man to the mercy of Jesus Christ—that He gave Himself for our sins, and suffered death for the sake of mercy, and forgave us our original sins; and thereby released us from the pains of Hell and lessened the pains of Purgatory by means of penitence, and gives us grace to do good, and, at the last, gives us the bliss of Heaven.

The kinds of mercy are: to lend, and to give, and to forgive, and to set free, and to have pity in heart and compassion on the tribulations of one’s fellow Christian, and also to chastise, as need may be. Another kind of remedy for avarice is reasonable largess; and truly, here it behooves one to give consideration to the grace of Jesus Christ, and to one’s temporal wealth, and also to the perdurable wealth that Christ gave to us; and to remember the death that he shall receive—he knows not when, where, or how—and also that he must forgo all that he has, save only that which he has invested in good works.

But forasmuch as some folk are immoderate, men ought to avoid foolish largess, which men call waste. Certainly, he that is prodigal gives not his wealth, but loses his wealth. Truly, that which he gives out of vainglory, as to minstrels and to followers, in order to have his renown carried about the world, he does sin thereby rather than give alms. Certainly, he shamefully loses his wealth who seeks in the gift thereof nothing but sin. He is like a horse that chooses rather to drink muddy or turbid water than the clear water of a well. And forasmuch as they give where they should not give, to them belongs that cursing which Christ will give at the day of doom to those that shall be damned.

---

## Here followeth Gluttony

After avarice comes gluttony, which also is entirely against the commandment of God. Gluttony is immoderate appetite to eat or to drink, or else to yield to the immoderate desire to eat or to drink. This sin corrupted all this world, as is well shown by the sin of Adam and Eve. Read also what Saint Paul says of gluttony:

> “For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.”

He that is addicted to this sin of gluttony may withstand no other sin. He must be in the service of all vices, for it is in the Devil’s hoard that he hides himself and rests.

This sin has many species. The first is drunkenness, which is the horrible sepulture of man’s reason; and therefore, when a man is drunk he has lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But truly, when a man is not wont to strong drink, and perhaps knows not the strength of the drink, or is feeble in his head, or has travailed, through which he drinketh the more, though he be suddenly taken with drink, it is not a deadly sin, but venial.

The second species of gluttony is when the spirit of a man groweth all disturbed; for drunkenness bereaveth him the discretion of his wit. The third species of gluttony is when a man devoureth his meat and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is when, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours in his body are distempered. The fifth is forgetfulness by too much drinking; for which sometimes a man forgets ere the morrow what he did at even or on the night before.

In another manner are the species of gluttony distinguished, after Saint Gregory. The first is to eat before the time to eat. The second is when a man gets himself delicate meat or drink. The third is when men take too much beyond measure. The fourth is curiosity, with great intent to make and to apparell his meat. The fifth is to eat too greedily. These be the five fingers of the Devil’s hand, by which he draweth folk to sin.

---

## The Remedy against Gluttony

72. Against gluttony the remedy is abstinence, as Galen says; but that I hold not meritorious if he do it only for the health of his body. Saint Augustine wills that abstinence be done for virtue and with patience. Abstinence, he says, is little worth unless a man have good will thereto, and unless it be enforced by patience and by charity, and that men do it for God’s sake, and in hope to have the bliss of Heaven.

73. The fellows of abstinence are temperance, which keepeth the mean in all things; also shame, which escheweth all dishonesty; sufficiency, which seeketh no rich meats nor drinks, nor maketh any force of too outrageous appareling of meat. Measure also, which restraineth by reason the enslaved appetite of eating; sobriety also, which restraineth the outrage of drinking; sparingness also, which restraineth the delicate ease to sit long at his meat and softly; wherefore some folk stand of their own will, to eat with less leisure.

## Here followeth Lechery

74. After gluttony, then cometh lechery; for these two sins are so near cousins that oftentimes they will not depart. God wot, this sin is full displeasing to God; for He said Himself, “Do no lechery.” And therefore He put great penalties against this sin in the old law. If a bondwoman were taken in this sin, she should be beaten to death with staves. And if she were a gentlewoman she should be slain with stones. And if she were a bishop’s daughter she should be burned, by God’s commandment. Furthermore, for the sin of lechery God drowned all the world by the deluge. And after that He burned five cities with thunderbolts and sank them into Hell.

Now let us speak then of that stinking sin of lechery that men call adultery of wedded folk, that is to say, if one of them be wedded, or else both. Saint John saith that adulterers shall be in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone — in the fire for the lechery, in brimstone for the stink of their filthiness. Certainly, the breaking of this sacrament is a horrible thing; it was ordained by God Himself in Paradise, and confirmed by Jesus Christ, as witness Saint Matthew in the Gospel: “For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh.” This sacrament betokeneth the knitting together of Christ and of Holy Church.

And not only did God forbid adultery in deed, but also He commanded that “thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife.” This behest, says Saint Augustine, containeth the forbidding of all desire to do lechery. Behold what Saint Matthew says in the Gospel: “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” Here you may see that not only the doing of this sin is forbidden, but also the desire to do that sin. This accursed sin grievously troubles those whom it haunts.

And first, it does harm to the soul; for it constraineth it to sin and to the pain of everlasting death. Unto the body it is a tribulation also, for it draineth it, and wasteth and ruineth it, and maketh of its blood a sacrifice to the Fiend of Hell; also it wasteth wealth and substance. And certainly, if it be a foul thing for a man to waste his wealth on women, it is yet fouler when, for such filthiness, women spend on men their wealth and their substance. This sin, as saith the prophet, robbeth man and woman of good name and of all honour; and it giveth great pleasure to the Devil, for thereby won he the greater part of the world. And just as a merchant delighteth most in that trading whereof he reapeth the greater gain, just so the Fiend delighteth in this filth.

This is the Devil’s other hand, with five fingers to catch the people into his slavery. The first finger is the foolish interchange of glances between the foolish woman and the foolish man, which slayeth just as the basilisk slayeth folk by the venom of its sight; for the lust of the eyes followeth the lust of the heart. The second finger is vile touching in wicked manner; and thereupon Solomon saith that he who toucheth and handleth a woman fares like the man that handleth the scorpion which stingeth and suddenly killeth by its poisoning; even as, if any man touche warm pitch, it defileth his fingers. The third is vile words, which are like fire, which immediately burn the heart. The fourth finger is kissing; and truly he were a great fool who would kiss the mouth of a burning oven. The fifth finger is lustful accord and intimate dalliance, by which they consent, and the deed is accomplished.

## Middle English (Original Text, cleaned)

are permitted to be merchants to bring from one country to the other their merchandise. That other trade, which men barter with fraud and treachery and deceit, with lies and with false oaths, is accursed and damnable. Spiritual trade is properly *Symonye*, that is, earnest desire to buy spiritual things, that is, things that appertain to the sanctuary of God and to the cure of the soul. This desire, if so be that a man do his diligence to perform it, albeit that his desire ne take no effect, yet is it to him a deadly sin; and if he be ordained, he is irregular.

Certes, Symonye is cleped of Symon Magus, that wolde han bought, for temporel catel, the gift that God hadde given, by the Holy Ghost, to Saint Peter and to the apostles. And therefore understond, that both he that selleth and he that buyeth things espiritual, been cleped Simonials; be it by catel, be it by procuringe, or by fleshly prayer of his friends, fleshly friends or espiritual friends. Fleshly, in two maneres; as by kinrede or other friends. Soothly, if they pray for him that is not worthy and able, it is Symonye if he take the benefice; and if he be worthy and able, ther is none.

That other manere is, whan a man or woman preyen folk to advance hem only for wicked fleshly affection that they have unto the person; and that is foul Symonye. But certes, in service for which men yeven things espiritual unto hir servants, it moot be understood that the service moot be honest, and *eles* not; and eke that it be without bargaining, and that the persone be able. For, as seith Saint Damasus, “Alle the sinnes of the world, compared to this sinne, ben as nought”; for it is the greatest sinne that may be, after the sinne of Lucifer and Antichrist. For, by this sinne God forleeth the Church, and the soul that He bought with His precious blood, by them that yeven churches to them that been not digne. For they putten in thieves, that stealen the souls of Jesu Christ and destroyen His patrimony. By swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the less reverence of the sacraments of holy Church; and swiche yevers of churches putten out the children of Christ, and putten into the church the Devil’s own son. They sell the souls that lambes should keep to the wolf that strangeth them. And therefore shul they never have part of the pasture of lambes, that is, the bliss of Heaven.

Now comth hasardrye with his appurtenances, as tables and raffles, of which cometh deceit, false oaths, chidings, and all ravines, blaspheming and reneying of God, and hate of his neighbours, wast of goods, misspending of time, and sometime manslaughter. Certes, hasardours ne may not be without great sinne while they haunt that craft. Of avarice comen eke lies, theft, false witness, and false oaths. And ye shul understand that these been great sins, and express against the commandments of God, as I have said.

False witness is in word and eke in deed. In word, as for to bereave thy neighbour’s good name by thy false witnessing, or bereave him his chattels or his heritage by thy false witnessing; when thou, for ire or for mede, or for envy, bearest false witness, or accusest him or excusest him by thy false witness, or else excusest thyself falsely. Beware ye, questmongers and notaries! Certes, for false witnessing was Susanna in full great sorrow and pain, and many another more. The sinne of theft is eke express against God’s hest, and that in two maneres, corporel and espiritual. Corporel, as for to take thy neighbour’s catel again his will, be it by force or by sleight, be it by short measure or by false measure. By stealing eke of false indictments upon him, and in borrowing of thy neighbour’s catel in intent never to pay it again, and semblable things.

Espiritual theft is Sacrilege, that is to say, hurting of holy things, or of things sacred to Christ, in two maneres; by reason of the holy place, as churches or church-yards, for which every vile sin that men do in such places may be called sacrilege, or every violence in such places. Also they that withdraw falsely the rights that longen to holy Church. And plainly and generally, sacrilege is to reave holy thing from holy place, or unholy thing out of holy place, or holy thing out of unholy place.

### The Relief against the Sin of Avarice (Middle English)

68. Now shul ye understande, that the relieving of Avarice is *misericorde* and pitee largely taken. And men mighten axe, why that misericorde and pitee is relievinge of Avarice? Certes, the avaricious man sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the needful man; for he deliteth him in the keeping of his tresor, and not in the rescuing ne relieving of his evene-cristene. And therfor speke I first of misericorde.

Thanne is misericorde, as seith the philosophe, a virtue by which the courage of man is stirred by the misse of him that is misused. Upon which misericorde followeth pitee in performing of charitable workes of misericorde. And certes, these thinges move a man to misericorde of Jesu Christ, that He yaf Himself for our gilt, and suffered death for misericorde, and forgaf us our original sinnes; and thereby released us fro the paines of Hell, and lessened the paines of Purgatory by penitence, and yeveth grace well to do, and at the last the bliss of Heaven. The species of misericorde been, as for to lene and for to yeve and to foryeve and release, and for to have pitee in heart, and compassion of the mischief of his evene-cristene, and eke to chastise there as need is. Another manere of remedie against Avarice is reasonable largesse; but soothly, here behoveth consideration of the grace of Jesu Christ, and of his temporal goods, and eke of the goods perdurable that Christ yaf to us; and to have remembrance of the death that he shall receive, he knoweth not when, where, nor how; and eke that he shall forgo all that he hath, save only that he hath expended in good workes.

69. But forasmuche as some folk be unmeasurable, men ought to eschew fool-largesse, that men clepen wast. Certes, he that is fool-large ne yeveth not his catel, but he loseth his catel. Soothly, that which he yeveth for vaine glory, as to minstrels and to folk, for to bear his renown in the world, he hath sinne there-of and none almesse. Certes, he loseth foule his good, that ne seeketh with the gift of his good nothing but sinne. He is like to a horse that seeketh rather to drinken drowy or troubled water than for to drink water of the clear well. And forasmuch as they yiven there as they should not yiven, to them appertaineth that malediction that Christ shall give at the day of doom to them that shall be damned.

## Here followeth Gluttony (Middle English)

70. After Avarice comth Glotonye, which is express eke again the commandment of God. Glotonye is unmeasured appetit to ete or to drinke, or else to doon y-nough to the unmeasured appetite and disorderly covetise to eten or to drinke. This sinne corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sinne of Adam and of Eve. Loke eke what seith Saint Paul of Glotonye. “Manye,” seith Saint Paul, “goon, of which I have ofte seyd to yow, and now I seie it weeping, that they been the enemys of the croys of Crist; of which the ende is deeth, and of which hir wombe is hir god, and hir glorie in confusion of hem that so saveren erthely thinges.” He that is use to this sinne of Glotonye ne may no sinne withstande. He moot been in servage of alle vices, for it is the Devil’s hoard where he hideth him and resteth.

This sinne hath many species. The first is drunkenesse, that is the horrible sepulture of mannes reason; and therefore, whan a man is drunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sinne. But soothly, whan a man is not wont to strong drinke, and peraventure knoweth not the strengths of the drinke, or hath feblesse in his head, or hath travailed, through which he drinketh the more, albeit he be sodeynly caught with drinke, it is no deadly sinne, but venial. The second species of Glotonye is that the spirit of a man waxeth all troubled; for drunkenesse bereveth him the discretion of his wit. The third species is whan a man devoureth his meat and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is whan, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours in his body be distempered. The fifth is forgetfulness by too much drinking; for which sometimes a man forgeteth ere the morrow what he did at even or on the night before.

71. In other maner been distinct the species of Glotonye, after Saint Gregorie. The first is for to ete before time to ete. The second is whan a man get him to delicate mete or drinke. The third is whan men taken to muche over measure. The fourth is curiositie, with great intent to make and apparellen his mete. The fifth is for to eten too greedily. These been the five fingers of the Devyl’s hand, by which he draweth folk to sinne.

## The Remedy against Gluttony (Middle English)

72. Agayns Glotonye is the remedie Abstinence, as seith Galien; but that holde I not meritorie, if he do it only for the hele of his body. Saint Augustin woll that Abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience. Abstinence, he seith, is little worth, but-if a man have good wille thereto, and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee, and that men doon it for Goddes sake, and in hope to have the blisse of Hevene.

73. The felawes of Abstinence been Attemperance, that holdeth the mene in alle thinges; eke Shame, that escheweth alle dishoneste; Suffisance, that seeketh no riche metes ne drinkes, ne dooth no force of too outrageous apparelling of mete. Measure also, that restraineth by reason the enslaved appetite of eting; Sobriety also, that restraineth the outrage of drinke; Sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long at his mete and softly; wherefore some folk stonden of their owene wille, to eten with the less leisure.

## Here followeth Lechery (Middle English)

74. After Glotonye, thanne comth Lecherie; for these two sinnes been so nigh cousins, that ofte tyme they wol not departe. God woot, this sinne is full displeasing thing to God; for He seyde Himself, “Do no lechery.” And therefore He put great peynes against this sinne in the olde lawe. If womman thral were taken in this sinne, she should be beaten with staves to death. And if she were a gentle woman, she should be slain with stones. And if she were a bishop’s daughter, she should have been burnt, by God’s commandment. Further over, by the sinne of Lecherie God dreynt all the world at the deluge. And after that He brent five cities with thunder-lights, and sank them into Hell.

75. Now lat us speke thanne of that stinking sinne of Lecherie that men clepe Avoutrie of wedded folk, that is to seyn if that one of them be wedded, or else both. Saint John seith that avouterers shall be in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone — in the fire for the lechery, in the brimstone for the stench of their filthiness. Certes, the breking of this sacrament is a horrible thing; it was ordeyned by God Himself in Paradise, and confirmed by Jesu Christ, as witness Saint Matthew in the Gospel: “For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twaine shall be one flesh.” This sacrament betokeneth the knitting together of Crist and of Holy Church.

And not only forbade God lechery in deed, but also he commanded that “thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife.” This behest, saith Saint Augustine, comprehendethe forbidding of all desire to do lechery. Behold what Saint Matthew saith in the Gospel: “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” Here may ye see that not only the doing of this sinne is forbidden, but also the desire to do that sinne. This cursed sinne grievously troubles them whom it haunted. And first, it hurteth the soule; for it constrainteth it to sinne and to the pain of everlastinge deeth. Unto the body it is a tribulation also, for it drawe it, and wasteth and ruineth it, and maketh of his blood a sacrifice to the Fiend of Hell. Also it wasteth richesse and substance. And certes if it be foul thing for a man to waste his good on women, it is yet fouler when women spend on men their goods and their substance for such filthines. This synne, as saith the prophet, robbeth man and woman of good name and of all honour; and it maketh greate joy to the Devil, for by that he wan the more part of the world. And even as a merchant deliteth most in that trafficking where he reapeth the greater profit, so the Fiend deliteth in this filth.

This is the Devyl’s other hand, with five fingers to catch folk into his slavery. The first finger is the foolish interchange of glances between the foolish woman and the foolish man, which killeth as the basilisk killeth by the venom of his sight; for the lust of the eyes followeth the lust of the heart. The second finger is vile touching in wicked manner; whereupon Solomon saith that he who toucheth and handleth a woman fareth like the man that handleth the scorpion which stingeth and suddenly killoth by his poison; even as if any man touche warm pitch, it defileth his fingers. The third is foul words, which are like fire, that soone burn the heart. The fourth finger is kissing; and truly he were a vile fool that would kisse the mouth of a burning oven. The fifth finger is the lustful accord, and then the act is accomplished.

shullen been in helle in a stank brenninge of fyr and of brimston; in fyr, for the lecherie; in brimston, for the stink of hir ordure. Certes, the brekinge of this sacrement is an horrible thing; it was maked of God him-self in paradys, and confermed by Jesu Crist, as witnesseth seint Mathew in the gospel:

> “A man shal lete fader and moder, and taken him to his wyf, and they shullen be two in one of flesh.”

This sacrement bitokneth the knittinge togidre of Crist and of holy chirche. And nat only that God forbad avoutrie in dede, but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighbores wyf. In this heeste, seith seint Augustin, is forboden alle manere coveitise to doon lecherie. Lo what seith seint Mathew in the gospel: that “whoso seeth a womman to coveitise of his lust, he hath doon lecherie with hir in his herte.” Here may ye seen that nat only the dede of this sinne is forboden, but eek the desyr to doon that sinne. This cursed sinne anoyeth grevousliche hem that it haunten. And first, to hir soule; for he oblygeth it to sinne and to peyne of deeth that is perdurable. Unto the body anoyeth it grevously eek, for it dreyeth him, and wasteth, and shent him, and of his blood he maketh sacrifyce to the feend of helle; it wasteth his catel and his substaunce. And certes, if it be a foul thing, a man to waste his catel on wommen, yet is it a fouler thing whan that, for swich ordure, wommen dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce. This sinne, as seith the prophete, bireveth man and womman hir gode fame, and al hir honour; and it is ful pleasaunt to the devel; for therby winneth he the moste partie of this world. And right as a marchant delyteth him most in chaffare that he hath most avantage of, right so delyteth the feend in this ordure.

### §76

This is that other hand of the devel, with five fingres, to cacche the peple to his vileinye. The firste finger is the fool lookinge of the fool womman and of the fool man, that sleeth, right as the basilisk sleeth folk by the venim of his sighte; for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte. The seconde finger is the vileyns touchinge in wikkede manere; and therfore seith Salomon, that whoso toucheth and handleth a womman, he fareth lyk him that handleth the scorpioun that stingeth and sodainly sleeth through his enveniming; as who-so toucheth warm pich, it shent his fingres. The thridde is foule wordes, that fareth lyk fyr, that right anon brenneth the herte. The fourthe finger is the kisseinge; and trewely he were a greet fool that wolde kisse the mouth of a brenninge ovene or of a fourneys. And more fooles been they that kissen in vileinye; for that mouth is the mouth of helle: and namely, these olde dotardes holours, yet wol they kisse, though they may nat do, and smatre hem. Certes, they been lyk to houndes; for an hound, whan he comth by the roser or by othere busshes, though he may nat pisse, yet wol he heve up his leg and make a countenaunce to pisse. And for that many a man weneth that he may nat sinne, for no likerousnesse that he doth with his wyf; certes, that opinion is fals. God woot, a man may sleen him-self with his owene knyf, and make himselven dronken of his owene tonne. Certes, be it wyf, be it child, or any worldly thing that he loveth bifore God, it is his maumet, and he is an ydolastre. Man sholde loven his wyf by discrecioun, paciently and atemprely; and thanne is she as though it were his suster. The fifthe finger of the develes hand is the stinkinge dede of Lecherie. Certes, the fyve fingres of Glotonie the feend put in the wombe of a man, and with hise fyve fingres of Lecherie he gripeth him by the reynes, for to throwen him into the fourneys of helle; ther-as they shul han the fyr and the wormes that evere shul lasten, and wepinge and wailinge, sharp hunger and thurst, and grimnesse of develes that shullen al to-trede hem, withouten respit and withouten ende. Of Lecherie, as I seyde, sourden diverse speces; as fornicacioun, that is bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried; and this is deedly sinne and agayns nature. Al that is enymee and destruccioun to nature is agayns nature. Parfay, the resoun of a man telleth eek him wel that it is deedly sinne, for-as-muche-as God forbad Lecherie. And seint Paul yeveth hem the regne, that is nat dewe to no wight but to hem that doon deedly sinne.

Another sinne of Lecherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede; for he that so dooth, certes, he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste degree that is in this present lyf, and bireveth hir thilke precious fruit that the book clepeth *the hundred fruyt*. I ne can seyn it noon other weyes in English, but in Latin it highte *Centesimus fructus*. Certes, he that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileinyes, mo than any man can rekene; right as he somtyme is cause of alle damages that bestes don in the feeld, that breketh the hegge or the closure; ther-through he destroyeth that which may nat been restored. For certes, na-more may maydenhede be restored than an arm that is smiten fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe. She may have mercy, this woot I wel, if she do penitence; but nevere shal it be that she nas corrupt. And al-be-it so that I have spoken somwhat of Avoutrie, it is good to shewen mo perils that longen to Avoutrie, for to eschue that foule sinne. *Avoutrie*, in Latin, is for to seyn approachinge of other mannes bed, through which tho that whylom weren o flessh abaundone hir bodyes to othere persones. Of this sinne, as seith the wise man, folwen manye harmes. First, brekinge of feith; and certes, in feith is the keye of Cristendom. And whan that feith is broken and lorn, soothly Cristendom stant veyn and withouten fruit. This sinne is eek a thefte; for thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thing agayns his wille. Certes, this is the fouleste thefte that may be, whan a womman steleth hir body from hir housbond and yeveth it to hire holour to defoule hir; and steleth hir soule fro Crist, and yeveth it to the devel. This is a fouler thefte than for to breke a chirche and stele the chalice; for thise avoutiers breken the temple of God spiritually, and stelen the vessel of grace, that is, the body and the soule, for which Crist shal destroyen hem, as seith seint Paul. Soothly of this thefte doutede gretly Joseph, whan that his lordes wyf preyed him of vileinye, whan he seyde, “Lo, my lady, how my lord hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world; ne no-thing of his thinges is out of my power, but only ye that been his wyf. And how sholde I thanne do this wickednesse, and sinne so horribly agayns God, and agayns my lord? God it forbede.” Allas! al to litel is swich trouthe now y-founde! The thridde harm is the filthe through which they breken the comaundement of God, and defoulen the auctour of matrimonie, that is Crist. For certes, in-so-muche as the sacrement of mariage is so noble and so digne, so muche is it gretter sinne for to breken it; for God made mariage in paradys, in the estaat of innocence, to multiplye man-kinde to the service of God. And therfore is the brekinge ther-of more grevous. Of which brekinge comen false heires ofte tyme, that wrongfully occupyen folkes heritages. And therfore wol Crist putte hem out of the regne of hevene, that is heritage to gode folk. Of this brekinge comth eek ofte tyme, that folk unware wedden or sinnen with hir owene kinrede; and namely thilke harlottes that haunten bordels of thise fool wommen, that mowe be likned to a commune gonge, whereas men purgen hir ordure. What seye we eek of putours that liven by the horrible sinne of puterie, and constreyne wommen to yelden to hem a certeyn rente of hir bodily puterie, ye, somtyme of his owene wyf or his child; as doon thise baudes? Certes, thise been cursede sinnes. Understond eek, that avoutrie is set gladly in the ten comandements bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre; for it is the gretteste thefte that may be; for it is thefte of body and of soule. And it is lyk to homicide; for it kerveth a-two and breketh a-two hem that first were maked o flesch, and therfore, by the olde lawe of God, they sholde be slayn. But nathelees, by the lawe of Jesu Crist, that is lawe of pitee, whan he seyde to the womman that was founden in avoutrie, and sholde han been slayn with stones, after the wil of the Jewes, as was hir lawe: “Go,” quod Jesu Crist, “and have na-more wil to sinne”; or, “wille na-more to do sinne.” Soothly, the vengeaunce of avoutrie is awarded to the peynes of helle, but if so be that it be destourbed by penitence. Yet been ther mo speces of this cursed sinne; as whan that oon of hem is religious, or elles bothe; or of folk that been entred into ordre, as subdekne or dekne or preest, or hospitaliers. And evere the higher that he is in ordre, the gretter is the sinne. The thinges that gretly agreggen hir sinne is the brekinge of hir avow of chastitee, whan they receyved the ordre. And forther-over, sooth is, that holy ordre is chief of al the tresorie of God, and his especial signe and mark of chastitee; to shewe that they been joyned to chastitee, which that is most precious lyf that is. And thise ordred folk been specially tytled to God, and of the special meynee of God; for which, whan they doon deedly sinne, they been the special traytours of God and of his peple; for they liven of the peple, to preye for the peple, and whyle they been suche traitours, hir preyers availen nat to the peple. Preestes been aungeles, as by the dignitee of hir misterye; but for sothe, seint Paul seith, that “Sathanas transformeth him in an aungel of light.” Soothly, the preest that haunteth deedly sinne, he may be likned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light; he semeth aungel of light, but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse. Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie, as sheweth in the book of Kinges, that they weren the sones of Belial, that is the devel. Belial is to seyn “withouten juge”; and so faren they; hem thinketh they been free, and han no juge, na-more than hath a free bole that taketh which cow that him lyketh in the toun. So faren they by wommen. For right as a free bole is ynough for al a toun, right so is a wikked preest compcioun ynough for al a parisshe, or for al a contree. Thise preestes, as seith the book, ne conne nat the misterie of preesthode to the peple, ne God ne knowe they nat; they ne helde hem nat apayd, as seith the book, of soden flesh that was to hem offred, but they toke by force the flesh that is rawe. Certes, so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayd of rosted flesh and sode flesh, with which the peple fedden hem in greet reverence, but they wol have raw flesh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres. And certes, thise wommen that consenten to hir harlotrie doon greet wrong to Crist and to holy chirche and alle halwes, and to alle soules; for they bireven alle thise him that sholde worshipe Crist and holy chirche, and preye for Cristene soules. And therfore han swiche preestes, and hir lemmanes eek that consenten to hir lecherie, the malisoun of al the court Cristen, til they come to amendement. The thridde spece of avoutrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf; and that is whan they take no reward in hir assembleinge, but only to hire fleshly delyt, as seith seint Jerome; and ne rekken of no-thing but that they been assembled; by cause that they been maried, al is good ynough, as thinketh to hem. But in swich folk hath the devel power, as seyde the aungel Raphael to Thobie; for in hir assembleinge they putten Jesu Crist out of hir herte, and yeven hem-self to alle ordure. The fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that been of hire kinrede, or of hem that been of oon affinitee, or dees with hem with whiche hir fadres or hir kinrede han deled in the sinne of lecherie; this sinne maketh hem lyk to houndes, that taken no kepe to kinrede. And certes, parentele is in two maneres, outher goostly or fleshly; goostly, as for to delen with hise godsibbes. For right so as he that engendreth a child is his fleshly fader, right so is his godfader his fader espirituel. For which a womman may in no lasse sinne assemblen with hir godsib than with hir owene fleshly brother. The fifthe spece is thilke abhominable sinne, of which that no man unnethe oghte speke ne write; nathelees it is openly reherced in holy writ. This cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse manere; but though that holy writ speke of horrible sinne, certes, holy writ may nat been defoulced, na-more than the sonne that shyneth on the mixen. Another sinne aperteneth to lecherie, that comth in slepinge; and this sinne comth ofte to hem that been maydenes, and eek to hem that been corrupt; and this sinne men clepen pollucioun, that comth in foure maneres. Somtyme, of languissinge of body; for the humours been to ranke and habundaunt in the body of man. Somtyme of infermetee; for the feblesse of the vertu retentif, as phisik maketh mencioun. Somtyme, for surfeet of mete and drinke. And somtyme of vileyns thoghtes, that been enclosed in mannes minde whan he goth to slepe; which may nat been withouten sinne. For which men moste kepen hem wysely, or elles may men sinnen ful grevously.

or of a furnace. And the more fools they are who kiss in vileness; for that mouth is the mouth of Hell; and I speak specifically of these old dotard whoremongers, who will yet kiss though they cannot do anything, and so smatter them. Certainly they are like dogs; for a dog, when he passes a rosebush, or other bushes, though he cannot piss, yet will he heave up his leg and make an appearance of pissing. And as for the opinion of many that a man cannot sin for any lechery he does with his wife, certainly that opinion is wrong. God knows, a man may slay himself with his own knife, and make himself drunk out of his own tun. Certainly, be it wife, be it child, or any worldly thing that a man loves bifore God, it is his idol, and he is an idolater. Man should love his wife with discretion, patiently and temperately; and then she is as though she were his sister. The fifth finger of the Devil’s hand is the stinking deed of lechery. Truly, the five fingers of Gluttony the fiend thrusts in the womb of a man, and with his five fingers of Lechery he grips him by the reins, to throw him into the furnaces of Hell; therein shall they have the fire and the everlasting worms, and weeping and wailing, sharp hunger and thirst, and the grimness of devils that shall tread upon them, without respite and without end. Of Lechery, as I said, spring diverse species; as *fornicacioun*, which is betwix man and woman that be not married; and this is deadly sin and against nature. All that is enemy and destruction to nature is against nature. Faith, the reason of a man tells him well that it is deadly sin, since God forbade Lechery. And Saint Paul giveth them the kingdom that is not due to any but to those that do deadly sin.

Another sin of Lechery is to bereave a maiden of her maidenhead; for he that so doeth, certainly he casteth a maiden out of the highest degree that is in this present life, and bereaveth her that precious fruit which the book calleth *the hundred fruit*. I can say it in no other way in English, but in Latin it is called *Centesimus fructus*. Certainly he that so doeth is the cause of many damages and villainies, more than any man can reckon; just as he is sometimes cause of all the damages that beasts do in the field, that break the hedge or the enclosure; through which he destroyeth that which may not be restored. For truly, no more may maidenhead be restored than an arm that is smitten from the body may return again to grow. She may have mercy, this I know well, if she do penance; but never shall it be that she was not corrupt. And albeit I have spoken somewhat of Adultery, it is good to shew more dangers that long to Adultery, in order that men may eschew that foul sin. *Adultery*, in Latin, is to say the approaching of another man’s bed, through which those that were once one flesh abandon their bodies to other persons. Of this sin, as the wise man says, follow many evils. First, breaking of faith; and certainly in faith is the key of Christendom. And when faith is broken and lost, truly Christendom stands vain and without fruit. This sin is also a theft; for theft generally is to deprive a person of his thing against his will. Certainly this is the foulest theft that may be, when a woman steals her body from her husband and gives it to her lecher to defile her; and steals her soul from Christ, and gives it to the devil. This is a fouler theft than to break into a church and steal the chalice; for these adulterers break the temple of God spiritually, and steal the vessel of grace, that is, the body and the soul, for which Christ shall destroy them, as Saint Paul says. Truly of this theft Joseph feared greatly, when his master’s wife entreated him of vileness, when he said, “Lo, my lady, how my lord hath taken to me under my ward all that he hath in this world; nor anything of his things is out of my power, but only ye that are his wife. And how should I then do this wickedness, and sin so horribly against God, and against my lord? God it forbid.” Alas! all too little is such truth now found! The third harm is the filth through which they break the commandment of God and defile the author of matrimony, that is Christ. For certainly, in so much as the sacrament of marriage is so noble and so worthy, so much the more is it a greater sin to break it; for God made marriage in Paradise, in the estate of innocence, to multiply mankind to the service of God. And therefore is the breaking thereof more grievous. Of which breaking often come false heirs, that wrongfully occupy folk’s heritages. And therefore will Christ put them out of the reign of Heaven, that is heritage to good folk. Of this breaking cometh also oftentimes, that folk unwary wed or sin with their own kinred; and namely those harlots that haunt bordels of these foul women, that may be likened to a common cesspool, whereas men purge their ordure. What shall we say also of pimps that live by the horrible sin of procuring, and constrain women to yield to them a certain rent of their bodily prostitution, yes, sometimes of his own wife or his child; as do these bawdes? Certainly these be cursed sins. Understand also that adultery is set gladly in the ten commandments between theft and manslaughter; for it is the greatest theft that may be; for it is theft of body and of soul. And it is like homicide; for it cleaveth asunder and breaketh asunder them that first were made one flesh, and therefore, by the old law of God, they should be slain. But nevertheless, by the law of Jesus Christ, that is law of pity, when he said to the woman that was found in adultery, and should have been slain with stones, after the will of the Jews, as was their law: “Go,” said Jesus Christ, “and have no more will to sin”; or, “will no more to do sin.” Truly the vengeance of adultery is awarded to the pains of Hell, unless it be disturbed by penitence. Yet be there more species of this cursed sin; as when one of them is religious, or else both; or of folk that be entered into order, as sub-deacon or deacon or priest, or hospitaller. And ever the higher that he is in order, the greater is the sin. The things that greatly aggravate their sin is the breaking of their avow of chastity, when they received the order. And furthermore, sooth is, that holy order is chief of all the treasury of God, and his especial sign and mark of chastity; to shew that those who have entered it are joined to chastity, which is the most precious life that is. And these ordered folk be specially titled to God, and of the special meiny of God; for which, when they do deadly sin, they be the special traitors of God and of his people; for they live of the people, to pray for the people, and while they be such traitors, their prayers avail not to the people. Priests be angels, by the dignity of their ministry; but forsooth, Saint Paul saith, that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” Soothly, the priest that haunteth deadly sin may be likened to an angel of darkness transformed into an angel of light; he seemeth angel of light, but forsooth he is angel of darkness. Such priests be the sons of Eli, as showeth in the Book of Kings, that they were the sons of Belial, that is the devil. Belial is to say “withouten judge”; and so fare they; them thinketh they be free, and have no judge, no more than hath a free bull that taketh which cow that him liketh in the town. So fare they by women. For right as a free bull is enough for all a town, right so is a wicked priest’s corruption enough for all a parish, or for all a country. These priests, as the Book saith, know not the mystery of priesthood to the people, ne God know they not; they holden hem not apaid, as saith the Book, of sodden flesh that was to hem offered, but they toke by force the flesh that is raw. Certes, so these shrewes holden hem not apaid of roasted flesh and sodden flesh, with which the people fed them in great reverence, but they will have raw flesh of folk’s wives and their daughters. And certes, these women that consenten to their harlotrie do great wrong to Christ and to holy church and all halwes, and to all souls; for they bereave all these of him that should worship Christ and holy church, and pray for Christian souls. And therefore have such priests, and their lemmans also that consenten to their lechery, the malison of all the Christian court, till they come to amendement. The third species of adultery is sometimes between a man and his wife; and that is when they take no reward in their assembling, but only for their fleshly delight, as saith Saint Jerome; and reckon of nothing but that they be assembled; because they be married, all is good enough, as thinketh to them. But in such folk hath the devil power, as said the angel Raphael to Tobias; for in their assembling they put Jesus Christ out of their heart, and give themselves to all ordure. The fourth species is the assembling of them that be of their kinred, or of them that be of one affinity, or those with whom their fathers or kinred have dealt in the sin of lechery; this sin maketh them like houndes, that take no keep to kinrede. And certes, parentele is in two maneres, either ghostly or fleshly; ghostly, as for to delen with his godsibbes. For right so as he that engendreth a child is his fleshly father, right so is his godfather his fader espirituel. For which a woman may in no lesser sinne assemble with her godsib than with her own fleshly brother. The fifth species is that abominable sinne, of which no man unnethe ought speak nor write; nevertheless it is openly rehearsed in holy writ. This cursedness do men and women in diverse ententes and in diverse maners; but though holy writ speak of horrible sinne, certes holy writ may not be defouled, no more than the sun that shineth on the muck-heap. Another sinne appertaineth to lechery, that cometh in sleeping; and this sinne cometh ofte to them that be maidens, and eke to them that be corrupt; and this sinne men clepen *pollucioun*, that cometh in four maneres. Somtyme, of languishing of body; for the humours be to ranke and abundant in the body of man. Somtyme, of infirmitee; for the feblesse of the vertu retentif, as physic maketh mention. Somtyme, for surfeit of mete and drinke. And somtyme, of vileyns thoughtes, that be enclosed in mannes mind when he goth to slepe; which may nat be withouten sinne. For which men moste kepe hem wisely, or else may men sinnen full grevously.

### The Remedy against the Sin of Lechery

Now cometh the remedie against Lecherie, and that is, generally, chastitee and continence, that restraineth alle the desordeyned movinges that comen of fleshly talentes. And evere the greater merite shal he have that most restraineth the wikked eschauffinges of the ordure of this sinne. And this is in two maneres, that is to seyn, chastitee in mariage, and chastitee in widwehode. Now shaltow understonde, that matrimoine is leeful assemblinge of man and of wommen, that receyven by vertu of the sacrament the bond, through which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf, that is to seyn, while that they liven bothe. This, as seith the book, is a ful greet sacrement. God made it, as I have seyd, in paradys, and wolde him-self be born in mariage. And for to holwen mariage, he was at a wedding, whereas he turned water into wyn; which was the first miracle that he wrought on erthe bifore his disciples. The trew effect of mariage is the cleansing of fornication and the replenishing of holy chirche with folk of good lineage; for that is the ende of mariage; and it chaungeth deadly sinne to venial sinne bitwixe them that been wedded, and maketh hem o the hertes, as wel as the bodies. This is trewe mariage, which was established by God er that sinne began, when natural lawe hadde his right estate in Paradys; and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o wyf, and o wyf but o man, as seint Augustin seith, and that for many causes.

First, because mariage figuren the union bitwixe Crist and holy chirche. And another is, for that the man is the heed of the womman; at any rate it hath been so ordeigned by ordinance. For if a womman hadde been made... (continues below)

77. Now comth the remedie agayns Lecherie, and that is, generally, Chastitee and Continence, that restreyneth alle the desordeyned moevinges that comen of fleshly talentes. And evere the gretter merite shal he han, that most restreyneth the wikked eschaufiges of the ordure of this sinne. And this is in two maneres, that is to seyn, chastitee in mariage, and chastitee in widwehode. Now shaltow understonde, that matrimoine is leeful assemblinge of man and of womman, that receyven by vertu of the sacrement the bond, through which they may nat be departed in al hir lif, that is to seyn, while that they liven bothe. This, as seith the book, is a ful greet sacrement. God maked it, as I have seyd, in paradys, and wolde him-self be born in mariage. And for to halwen mariage, he was at a weddinge, whereas he turned water into wyn; which was the first miracle that he wrought on erthe bifore his disciples.

Now shaltow understonde that the remediaile of chastitee is in two maneres: in mariage, and in celibacie (widwehode or religion). Matrimony is lawful union of man and woman by which they receive by virtue of the sacrament a bond not to be broken while they both live. This sacrament was ordained by God in Paradise, and He Himself was born in marriage. To sanctify marriage He was at a wedding where He turned water into wine.

First, because marriage figures the union between Christ and holy Church. Another reason is that the man is head of the woman; at any rate, it hath been so ordained. If a woman had... (the treatise proceeds to explain further remedies and precepts, continuing in the text supplied above).

# THE PARSON’S TALE

### 78
First, for marriage is figured between Christ and Holy Church. And that other is, for a man is head of a woman; therefore, by ordinance it should be so. For if a woman had more men than one, then she should have more heads than one, and that were a horrible thing before God; and also a woman could not please many folk at once. And also there should never be peace nor rest among them; for each would demand his own thing. And furthermore, no man should know his own issue, nor who should have his heritage; and the woman should be the less beloved from the time that she were joined to many men.

### 79
Now comes the question how a man should bear himself with his wife; and namely in two things, that is to say, in sufferance and reverence, as Christ showed when He made the first woman. For He made her not of the head of Adam, that she should not claim great lordship. For whereas the woman hath the mastery, she maketh much disorder; there need no examples of this. The experience of day by day ought suffice. Also certainly God made not woman of the foot of Adam, for she should not be held too low; for she can not patiently suffer. But God made woman of the rib of Adam, for woman should be fellow unto man. Man should bear him to his wife in faith, in truth, and in love, as Saint Paul saith: that “a man should love his wife as Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it.” So should a man for his wife, if it were need.

### 80
Now how that a woman should be subject to her husband, that telleth Saint Peter. First, in obedience. And eke, as saith the decree, a woman that is a wife, so long as she is a wife, hath no authority to swear nor to bear witness without leave of her husband, that is her lord; in any case, he should be so by reason. She should eke serve him in all honesty, and be temperate of her array. I wot well that they should set their intent to please their husbands, but not by the quaintness of array. Saint Jerome saith that wives that been apparelled in silk and in precious purple may not clothe them in Jesus Christ. What saith Saint John eek in this matter? Saint Gregory eke saith that no wight seeketh precious array but only for vain glory, to be honoured the more before the people. It is a great folly a woman to have fair array outward and be foul inward. A wife should eke be measurable in looking and in bearing and in laughing, and discreet in all her words and her deeds. And above all worldly things she should love her husband with all her heart, and to him be true of her body; so should a husband eke be to his wife. For since that all the body is the husband’s, so should her heart be; or else there is between them two, as in that part, no perfect marriage. Then shall men understand that for three things a man and his wife fleshly may assemble. The first is in intent of engendering children to the service of God, for certes that is the final cause of matrimony. Another cause is, to yield each of them to other the debt of their bodies, for neither of them hath power over his own body. The third is, to eschew lechery and vileness. The fourth is, indeed, deadly sin.

As to the first, it is meritorious; the second also; for, as the law says, she hath merit of chastity who yields to her husband the debt of her body, yea, though it be against her liking and the desire of her heart. The third manner is venial sin, and truly scarce may any of these be without venial sin, for the corruption and for the delight. The fourth manner is, to understand, if they assemble only for amorous love and for none of the foresaid causes, but to accomplish that burning delight, never recking how often, verily it is deadly sin; and yet, with sorrow, some folk will pain themselves more to do it than their appetite sufficeth.

### 81
The second manner of chastity is to be a clean widow, and eschew the embraces of man, and desire the embracing of Jesus Christ. These are those that have been wives and have lost their husbands, and eke women that have done lechery and have been relieved by penitence. And certes, if a wife could keep herself always chaste with leave and licence of her husband, so that she give never occasion that he sin, it were to her a great merit. These manner women that observe chastity must be clean in heart as well as in body and in thought, and measurable in clothing and in countenance; and be abstinent in eating and drinking, in speaking, and in deed. They are the vessel or the box of the blessed Magdalene, that filleth Holy Church of good odour. The third manner of chastity is virginity, and it behoveth that she be holy in heart and clean of body; then is she spouse to Jesus Christ, and she is the life of angels. She is the praise of this world, and she is as these martyrs in equality; she hath in her that which tongue may not tell nor heart think. Virginity bore our Lord Jesus Christ, and virgin was He Himself.

### 82
Another remedy against lechery is specially to withdraw oneself from such things as give occasion to that vileness; as ease, and eating and drinking; for certes, when the pot boileth strongly, the best remedy is to withdraw the fire. Sleeping long in great quiet is eke a great nurse to lechery.

### 83
Another remedy against lechery is that a man or a woman eschew the company of them by whom he doubteth to be tempted; for albeit the deed be withstood, yet is there great temptation. Soothly a white wall, although it burn not fully by the setting of a candle, yet is the wall black of the light. Full oftentimes I rede that no man trust in his own perfection, but he be stronger than Samson, and holier than David, and wiser than Solomon.

### 84
Now after that I have declared you, as I can, the seven deadly sins, and some of their branches and their remedies, soothly, if I could, I would tell you the ten commandments. But so high a doctrine I leave to divines. Natheless, I hope to God they have been touched in this treatise, each of them all.

## Of Confession

### 85
Now forasmuch as the second part of penitence standeth in confession of mouth, as I began in the first chapter, I say Saint Augustine saith: sin is every word and every deed, and all that men covet against the law of Jesus Christ; and this is to sin in heart, in mouth, and in deed, by thy five wits, that be sight, hearing, smelling, tasting or savoring, and feeling. Now it is good to understand that that agregeth much every sin. Thou shalt consider what thou art that doest the sin, whether thou be male or female, young or old, gentle or thrall, free or servant, whole or sick, wedded or single, ordered or unordained, wise or fool, clerk or secular; if she be of thy kindred, bodily or ghostly, or none; if any of thy kindred have sinned with her or none; and many more things.

### 86
Another circumstance is this: whether it be done in fornication, or in adultery, or none; incest, or none; maiden, or none; in manner of homicide, or none; horrible great sins, or small; and how long thou hast continued in sin. The third circumstance is the place where thou hast done sin: whether in other men's house or in thine own; in field or in church, or in churchyard; in a dedicated church, or none. For if the church be hallowed, and man or woman spill his kind in that place by way of sin, or by wicked temptation, the church is interdicted till it be reconciled by the bishop; and the priest that did such a vileness, to the term of all his life, he should never more sing mass; and if he did, he should do deadly sin at every time that he so sang mass. The fourth circumstance is by which mediators or by which messages, as for enticement, or for consenting to bear company with fellowship; for many a wretch, for to bear company, will go to the Devil of Hell. Wherefore they that egg on or consent to the sin be parteners of the sin, and of the damnation of the sinner. The fifth circumstance is how many times he hath sinned, if it be in his mind, and how oft that he hath fallen. For he that oft falleth in sin, he despiseth the mercy of God, and increaseth his sin, and is unkind to Christ; and he waxeth the more feeble to withstand sin, and sinneth the more lightly, and the later riseth, and is the more loath to shrive him, namely to him that is his confessor. For which folk, when they fall again into their old follies, either they forsake their old confessors altogether, or else they depart their shrift in diverse places; but truly such divided shrift deserveth no mercy of God of his sins. The sixth circumstance is why that a man sinneth, as by which temptation; and if himself procure that temptation, or by the exciting of other folk; or if he sin with a woman by force, or by her own assent; or if the woman, maugree her head, hath been enforced or none; this shall she tell; for covetousness, or for poverty, and if it was her procuring, or none; and suchlike matters.

The seventh circumstance is in what manner he hath done his sin, or how that she hath suffered that folk have done to her. And the same shall the man tell plainly, with all circumstances; and whether he hath sinned with common bordel-women, or none; or done his sin in holy times or none; in fasting-times or none; or before confession or after his last shriving; and whether he hath, peradventure, broken therefore his penance enjoined; by whose help and by whose counsel; by sorcery or craft; all must be told. All these things, after that they be great or small, engender the conscience of man. And eke the priest that is thy judge may the better be advised of his judgment in yeving of thy penance, and that is after thy contrition. For understand well that after time that a man hath defiled his baptism by sin, if he will come to salvation, there is no other way but by penitence and shrift and satisfaction; and namely by the two, if there be a confessor to which he may shrive him; and the third, if he have life to perform it.

### 87
Then shall a man look and consider that if he will make a true and a profitable confession, there must be four conditions. First, it must be in sorrowful bitterness of heart, as said King Hezekiah to God: “I will remember all the days of my life in bitterness of heart.” This condition of bitterness hath five signs. The first is that confession must be shamefaced, not to cover nor to hide his sin, for he hath agilt his God and defiled his soul. And thereof saith Saint Augustine: “The heart travaileth for the shame of his sin”; and for he hath great shamefacedness, he is worthy to have great mercy of God. Such was the confession of the publican, who would not heaven up his eyes to heaven, for he had offended God of heaven; for which shamefacedness he had anon the mercy of God. And thereof saith Saint Augustine that such shamefaced folk be next to forgiveness and remission. Another sign is humility in confession; of which saith Saint Peter, “Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.” The hand of God is mighty in confession, for thereby God forgiveth thee thy sins; for He alone hath the power. And this humility shall be in heart, and in sign outward; for right as he hath humility to God in his heart, right so should he humble his body outward to the priest that sit in God’s place. For which in no manner, since Christ is sovereign and the priest mean and mediator between Christ and the sinner, and the sinner is the last by way of reason, then should not the sinner sit as high as his confessor, but kneel before him or at his feet, but if malady disturb it. For he shall not take keep who sit there, but in whose place that he sitteth. A man that hath trespassed to a lord, and cometh for to ask mercy and make his accord, and set him down anon by the lord, men would holden him outrageous and not worthy so soon to have remission nor mercy. The third sign is that thy shrift should be full of tears, if man may; and if man may not weep with his bodily eyes, let him weep in his heart. Such was the confession of Saint Peter; for after that he had forsaken Jesus Christ, he went out and wept full bitterly.

### 88
The fourth sign is that he let not for shame to shew his confession. Such was the confession of the Magdalene, that spared not, for no shame of them that were at the feast, to go to our Lord Jesus Christ and bikenow to Him her sins. The fifth sign is that a man or a woman be obedient to receive the penance that to him is enjoined for his sins; for certes Jesus Christ, for the guilt of a man, was obedient unto death.

The second condition of a true confession is that it be hastily done; for certes, if a man had a deadly wound, ever the longer that he tarried to cure himself, the more would it corrupt and hasten him to his death; and eke the wound would be the worse to heal. And right so fareth sin that long time is in a man unshown. Certes, a man ought hastily to shew his sins for many causes; as for dread of death, that cometh oft suddenly, and is in no certain what time it shall be, nor in what place; and eke the fetching of one sin draweth in another; and eke the longer that he tarrieth, the farther he is from Christ. And if he abide to his last day, scarce may he shrive him or remember him of his sins or repent him, for the grievous malady of his death. And forasmuch as he hath not in his life hearkened Jesus Christ when He spake, he shall cry to Jesus Christ at his last day, and scarce will he hearken Him.

# THE PARSON’S TALE

### HERE ENDETH THE SECOND PART OF PENITENCE

Understand that this condition must have four things. Thy shrift must be provided beforehand and considered; for wicked haste brings no profit; and that a man know how to shrive himself of his sins, be they of pride, or of envy, and so forth, according to the species and circumstances; and that he have comprehended in his mind the number and the greatness of his sins, and how long that he hath lain in sin; and also that he be contrite of his sins, and in steadfast purpose, by the grace of God, never again to fall into sin; and also that he dread and watch himself, that he flee the occasions of sin to which he is inclined.

Also thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man, and not a part to one man and a part to another; that is to understand, when the intention is to divide thy confession out of shame or fear; for this is but the strangling of thy soul. For certes, Jesus Christ is wholly all good; in Him is no imperfection; and therefore either He forgiveth all perfectly or never a deal. I say not that if thou be assigned to the penitent for certain sin, that thou art bound to shew him all the remainder of thy sins, of which thou hast been shriven to thy curate, unless it please thee of thine humility; this is no dividing of shrift.

Nor do I say, where I speak of division of confession, that if thou have licence to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, where thou likest, and by licence of thy curate, that thou mayst not well shrive thee to him of all thy sins. But let no blot be left behind; let no sin be untold, so far as thou hast remembrance of them. And when thou shalt be shriven by thy curate, tell him also all of the sins that thou hast done since last thou wert shriven; and then this will be no wicked intent to divide confession.

Also, true confession asks certain other conditions. First, that thou shrive thee of thy free will, not by constraint, nor for shame, nor for illness, nor for such things; for it is reasonable that he who trespassed of his own free will shall as freely confess it, and that no other man tell his sin, but that he himself do it, nor shall he withhold or deny his sin, nor allow himself to become angry at the priest for admonishing him to leave sin.

Another condition is that thy shrift be lawful; that is to say, that thou who shrivest thee, and also the priest who hears thy confession, be verily of the faith of Holy Church; and that a man be not deprived of hope of the mercy of Jesus Christ, as was Cain or Judas. And also a man must himself accuse himself for his own trespass, and not another; but he shall blame and reproach himself and his own malice for his sin, and not another; nevertheless, if another man be the occasion or enticer of his sin, or the estate of a person be such that because of that person the sin is aggravated, or else that he cannot fully shrive himself without telling of the person with whom he has sinned; then he may tell; so that the intention be not to backbite such a person, but only to declare fully the confession.

Also thou shalt tell no lies in thy confession, as, for humility, perchance, to say that thou hast done sins of which thou wert never guilty. For Saint Augustine says: if thou, by reason of thy humility, liest against thyself, though thou wast not in sin before, yet art thou then in sin because of thy lying. Thou must also confess thy sin with thine own mouth, unless thou grow dumb, and not by letter; for thou hast done the sin and thou shalt have the shame thereof. Also, thou shalt not embellish thy confession with fair and subtle words, the more to cover up the sin; for then thou beguilest thyself and not the priest; thou must tell it plainly, be it ever so foul or so horrible. Thou shalt also shrive thee to a priest that is discreet in counselling thee, and moreover, thou shalt not shrive thee for vainglory, nor hypocritically, nor for any cause other than the fear of Jesus Christ and the health of thy soul. Also, thou shalt not run suddenly to the priest to tell him lightly of thy sin, as one would tell a jest or a tale, but advisedly and with great devotion. And generally speaking, shrive thee often. If thou fall often, then thou risest by confession. And though thou shrive thee more than once of sin for which thou hast been already shriven, it is the more merit. And, as Saint Augustine says, thou shalt thereby the more easily obtain release from and the grace of God, both as to sin and punishment. And certainly, once a year, at the least, it is lawful to receive the Eucharist; for truly, once a year all things are renewed.

This prayer must be truly said and in very faith, and that men pray to God orderly and discreetly and devoutly; and always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of God. This prayer must also be said with great humility and all innocently; honorably, and not to the annoyance of any man or woman. It must also be followed by works of charity. It availeth also against the vices of the soul; for, as Saint Jerome says, “By fasting we are saved from the vices of the flesh, and by prayer from the vices of the soul.”

After this, thou shalt understand that bodily pain stands in waking; for Jesus Christ says, “Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.” Ye shall understand also, that fasting stands in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and drink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of deadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly sin with all his might.

And thou shalt understand also that God ordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things: largeness to poor folk, gladness of spiritual heart (not to be angry nor annoyed, nor to grudge because one fasts), and also reasonable hours for eating by measure; that is to say, a man shall not eat out of season, nor sit the longer at his table to eat because he has fasted.

Then shalt thou understand that bodily pain stands in discipline or teaching, by word or by writing, or in example. Also in wearing of hair shirts or of coarse straw, or of hauberjons on the naked flesh, for Christ’s sake, and such manner of penances. But beware well that such manner of penances on thy flesh make not thy heart bitter or angry or annoyed with thyself; for better is to cast away thine hair than to cast away the meekness of Jesus Christ. And therefore Saint Paul says: “Clothe you, as they that be chosen of God, in heart of mercy, debonairtee, sufferance, and such manner of clothing”; of which Jesus Christ is more pleased than of hair-shirts, or hauberjons, or hauberks.

Then is discipline also in smiting of thy breast, in scourging with rods, in kneelings, in tribulations; in suffering patiently wrongs that be done to thee, and also in patient sufferance of maladies, or loss of worldly chattels, or of wife, or of child, or other friends.

Then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance; and this is in four manners, that is, dread (fear), shame, hope, and despair. And to speak first of dread: for which he thinketh that he may suffer no penance; thereto is remedy to think that bodily penance is but short and little in regard of the pain of Hell, that is so cruel and so long that it lasteth without end.

Now against the shame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely these hypocrites that would be held so perfect that they have no need to shrive them — against that shame should a man think that, by way of reason, he that hath not been ashamed to do foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair (good) things, and of such is confession. A man should also think that God seeth and knoweth all his thoughts and all his works; to Him may nothing be hid nor covered. Men should also remember the shame that is to come at the day of doom to them that be not penitent and shriven in this present life. For all the creatures in earth and in hell shall openly see all that they hid in this world.

Now, for to speak of the hope of them that be negligent and slow to shrive them, that standeth in two manners. That one is, that he hopeth to live long and to purchase much wealth for his delight, and then he will shrive him; and, as he saith, it seemeth to him then timely enough to come to shrift. Another is, presumption that he hath in Christ’s mercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no surety; and also that all the riches of this world be in aventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall. And, as Saint Gregory saith, it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God that never shall the pain stint of them that never would withdraw them from sin, their thanks, but aye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they have perpetual pain.

Despair is in two manners: the first despair is concerning the mercy of Christ; the other is that they think that they might not long persevere in goodness. The first despair cometh of that he deemeth that he hath sinned so greatly and so often, and so long lain in sin, that he shall not be saved. Certes, against that cursed despair he should think that the Passion of Jesus Christ is more strong to unbind than sin is strong to bind. Against the second despair, he shall think that as often as he falleth he may arise again by penitence. And though he never so long have lain in sin, the mercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy. Against the despair that he deemeth that he shall not long persevere in goodness, he shall think that the weakness of the devil may nothing do except men will suffer him; and also he shall have strength by the help of God, and of all Holy Church, and of the protection of angels, if him list.

Then shall men understand what is the fruit of penance; and, after the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of Heaven, there joy hath no contrary of woe nor grievance; there all harms be passed of this present life; there is surety from the pain of Hell; there is the blissful company that rejoice them evermore, each of other’s joy; there the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is more dear than the sun; there the body, that whilom was sick, frail, and feeble, and mortal, is immortal, and so strong and so whole that there may nothing impair it; there is neither hunger, thirst, nor cold, but every soul replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This blissful reign may men purchase...

### HERE FOLLOWETH THE THIRD PART OF SATISFACTION

#### 91.

Now have I told you of veray Confession, that is the second part of Penitence.

The third part of Penitence is Satisfaction; and that standeth most generally in alms and in bodily pain. Now there be three manners of alms: contrition of heart, where a man offereth himself to God; another is to have pity of default of his neighbours; and the third is in giving of good counsel, ghostly and bodily, where men have need, and namely in sustenance of men’s food. And take keep, that a man hath need of these things generally: he hath need of food, he hath need of clothing and harbour, he hath need of charitable counsel, and visiting in prison and in sickness, and sepulture of his dead body. And if thou mayst not visit the needful with thy person, visit him by thy message and by thy gifts. These be generally alms or works of charity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in counseling. Of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom.

#### 92.

These alms shalt thou do of thine own proper things, and hastily, and privily if thou mayst; but nevertheless, if thou mayst not do it privily, thou shalt not forbear to do alms though men see it; so that it be not done for the thanks of the world, but only for the thanks of Jesus Christ. For as witnesseth Saint Matthew, capitulo quinto: 

> “A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but set it on a candlestick, to give light to them that be in the house. Right so shall your light lighten before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.”

#### 93.

Now as to speak of bodily pain, it standeth in prayers, in wakings, in fastings, in virtuous teaching of orisons. And ye shall understand that orisons or prayers be to say a pitiful will of heart that redresseth it in God and expresseth it by word outward, to remove harms and to have things spiritual and durable, and sometime temporal things; of which orisons, certes, in the orison of the *Pater-noster*, hath Jesus Christ enclosed most things. Certes, it is privileged of three things in his dignity, for which it is more dignified than any other prayer: for that Jesus Christ himself made it; and it is short, so that it should be learned the more lightly, and to be withheld the more easily in heart, and to help himself the oftener with the orison; and that a man should be the less weary to say it, and that a man may not excuse himself to learn it, it is so short and so easy; and for it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers. The exposition of this holy prayer, that is so excellent and dignified, I bytake to these masters of theology; save thus much will I say: that, when thou prayest that God should forgive thee thy trespasses as thou forgivest them that trespass to thee, be full well ware that thou be not out of charitee. This holy orison diminish[eth] eke venial sin; and therefore it appertaineth specially to penitence.

#### 94.

This prayer must be truly said and in very faith, and that men pray to God orderly and discreetly and devoutly; and always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of God. This orison must also be said with great humbleness and full pure; honestly, and not to the annoyance of any man or woman. It must also be continued with the works of charity. It availeth also against the vices of the soul; for, as Saint Jerome saith, “By fasting are the vices of the flesh saved, and by prayer the vices of the soul.”

#### 95.

After this, thou shalt understand that bodily pain standeth in waking; for Jesu Crist saith, “Wake ye, and pray that ye ne enter into wicked temptation.” Ye shall understand also, that fasting standeth in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and drink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of deadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly sin with all his might.

#### 96.

And thou shalt understand also that God ordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things. Largeness to poor folk, gladness of the heart spiritual, not to be angry nor annoyed, nor grudge for he fasteth; and also reasonable hour for to eat by measure; that is to say, a man shall not eat out of time, nor sit the longer at his table to eat because he fasteth.

#### 97.

Then shalt thou understand that bodily pain standeth in discipline or teaching, by word or by writing, or in example. Also in wearing of hair-shirts or of straw, or of haubergeons on the naked flesh, for Christ’s sake, and such manner penances. But beware thee well that such manner penances on thy flesh do not make thine heart bitter or angry or annoyed of thyself; for better is to cast away thine hair than to cast away the meekness of Jesu Crist. And therefore saith Saint Paul: “Clothe you, as they that be chosen of God, in heart of mercy, debonairtee, sufferance, and such manner of clothing”; of which Jesu Crist is more pleased than of hair-shirts, or haubergeons, or hauberks.

#### 98.

Then is discipline also in knocking of thy breast, in scourging with rods, in kneelings, in tribulations; in suffering patiently wrongs that be done to thee, and also in patient sufferance of maladies, or the losing of worldly chattel, or of wife, or of child, or other friends.

#### 99.

Then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance; and this is in four manners, that is, dread, shame, hope, and despair. And to speak first of dread: for which he thinketh that he may suffer no penance; thereagainst is remedy to think that bodily penance is but short and little in regard of the pain of Hell, that is so cruel and so long, that it lasteth without end.

#### 100.

Now against the shame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely these hypocrites that would be held so perfect that they have no need to shrive them; against that shame should a man think that, by way of reason, he that hath not been ashamed to do foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair (good) things, and of such is confession. A man should also think that God seeth and knoweth all his thoughts and all his works; to Him may no thing be hid nor covered. Men should also remember the shame that is to come at the day of doom to them that be not penitent and shriven in this present life; for all the creatures in earth and in hell shall see openly all that they hid in this world.

#### 101.

Now for to speak of the hope of them that be negligent and slow to shrive them, that standeth in two manners. That one is, that he hopeth to live long and to purchase much riches for his delight, and then he will shrive him; and, as he saith, it seemeth to him then timely enough to come to shrift. Another is surquidry (presumption) that he hath in Christ’s mercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no surety; and also that all the riches in this world be in adventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall. And, as saith Saint Gregory, that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God, that never shall the pain stint of them that never would withdraw them from sin their thanks, but aye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they have perpetual pain.

#### 102.

Despair (wanhope) is in two manners: the first despair is concerning the mercy of Christ; the other is that they think that they might not long persevere in goodness. The first despair cometh of that he deemeth that he hath sinned so greatly and so often, and so long lain in sin, that he shall not be saved. Certes, against that cursed despair he should think that the Passion of Jesu Christ is more strong to unbind than sin is strong to bind. Against the second despair, he shall think that as oft as he falleth he may arise again by penitence. And though he never so long have lain in sin, the mercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy. Against the despair that he deemeth that he should not long persevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the devil may nothing do unless men will suffer him; and also he shall have strength of the help of God, and of all Holy Church, and of the protection of angels, if him list.

#### 103.

Then shall men understand what is the fruit of penance; and, after the word of Jesu Christ, it is the endless bliss of Heaven, where joy hath no contrariety of woe nor grievance; where all harms be passed of this present life; where is the surety from the pain of Hell; where is the blissful company that rejoice them evermore, each of other’s joy; where the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is more dear than the sun; where the body, that whilom was sick, frail, and feeble, and mortal, is immortal, and so strong and so whole that there may nothing impair it; where there is neither hunger, thirst, nor cold, but every soul replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This blissful reign may men purchase by true penitence and satisfaction and by the grace of God.

HERE ENDETH THE THIRD PART OF SATISFACTION

THE CANTERBURY TALES

# THE PARSON’S TALE

Hell shall openly behold all that sinners hide in this world.

Now to speak of the hope of those who are negligent and slow in shriving themselves—that is of two sorts. The one is, that he hopes to live long and to acquire riches for his delight, and then he will shrive himself; and as he tells himself, it seems to him that it will then be time enough to go to confession. Another is the over-confidence that he has in Christ’s mercy. Against the first vice he shall think, that our life is in no security; and also that all the riches in this world are at hazard, and pass as does a shadow on the wall. And, as Saint Gregory says, it is part of the great righteousness of God that never shall the torment cease of those that would never withdraw themselves willingly from sin, but have always continued in sin; because, for the perpetual will to sin, they shall have perpetual torment.

Despair is of two sorts: the first is of the mercy of Christ; the other is the thought of sinners that they cannot long persevere in goodness. The first despair comes of the thought that he has sinned so greatly and so often, and has lain so long in sin, that he shall not be saved. Certainly, against that accursed despair should be set the thought that the passion of Jesus Christ is stronger to loose than sin is strong to bind. Against the second despair, let him think that as often as he falls he may rise again by penitence. And though he may have lain in sin ever so long, the mercy of Christ is ever ready to receive him into grace. Against that form of despair wherein he deems that he should not long persevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the Devil can do nothing unless men allow him to; and also that he shall have the strength of the help of God and of all Holy Church and of the protection of angels, if he will.

Then shall men understand what is the fruit of penance; and according to the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of Heaven, where joy has no opposite of woe or grievance, where all evils of this present life are past; wherein is security from the torments of Hell; wherein is the blessed company that rejoices evermore, each of the others’ joy; wherein the body of man, that formerly was foul and dark, is more bright than the sun; wherein the body, that lately was ailing, frail, and feeble, and mortal, is immortal, and so strong and so whole that nothing may impair it; wherein is no hunger nor thirst, nor cold, but every soul is replenished with the ability to perceive the perfect knowing of God. This blessed kingdom may man acquire by poverty of spirit, and the glory of humbleness, and the plenitude of joy by hunger and thirst, and the ease and rest by labour, and life by death and the mortification of sin.

> By poverty of spirit, and the glory by lowliness;  
> the plentitude of joy by hunger and thirst, and the  
> rest by travail; and the life by death and mortification of sin.

## Envoi

Now do I pray all those who hear this little treatise, or read it, that, if there be within it anything that pleases them, they thank Our Lord Jesus Christ, from Whom proceeds all understanding and all goodness. And if there be anything that displeases them, I pray them, also, that they impute it to the fault of my ignorance and not to my intention, which would fain have better said if I had had the knowledge. For our Book says, “All that is written is written for our instruction”; and that was my intention. Wherefore I meekly beseech you that, for the sake of God’s mercy, you pray for me that Christ have mercy upon me and forgive me my trespasses — and especially for my translations and the writing of worldly vanities, which I withdraw in my retractations: as, *The Book of Troilus*; also *The Book of Fame*; *The Book of the Nineteen Ladies*; *The Book of the Duchess*; *The Book of Saint Valentine’s Day*, *Of the Parliament of Birds*; *The Tales of Canterbury*, those that tend toward sin; *The Book of the Lion*; and many another book, were they in my remembrance; and many a song and many a lecherous lay,— to which may Christ, of His great mercy, forgive me the sin. But for the translation of Boethius’s *De Consolatione*, and other books of legends of saints, and homilies, and of morality and devotion — for those I thank Our Lord Jesus Christ and His Blessed Mother and all the saints of Heaven; beseeching them that they, henceforth unto my life’s end, send me grace whereof to bewail my sins, and to study for the salvation of my soul: — and grant me the grace of true penitence, confession, and expiation in this present life; through the benign grace of Him Who is King of kings and Priest over all priests, Who redeemed us with the precious blood of His heart; so that I may be one of those, at the day of doom, that shall be saved: *Qui cum Patre, etc.*

Now preye I to hem alle that herkne this litel tretis or rede, that if ther be any thing in it that liketh hem, that therof they thanken oure Lord Jesu Crist, of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse. And if ther be any thing that displese hem, I preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unconninge, and nat to my wil, that wolde ful fayn have seyd bettre if I hadde had conninge. For oure boke seith, “Al that is writen is writen for oure doctrine”; and that is myn entente. Wherfore I biseke yow mekely for the mercy of God, that ye preye for me, that Crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes: — and namely, of my translacions and endytinges of worldly vanitees, the whiche I revoke in my retracciouns: as is the book of Troilus; the book also of Fame; the book of the Nynetene Ladies; the book of the Duchesse; the book of Seint Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes; the tales of Caunterbury, thilke that sounen into sinne; the book of the Leoun; and many another book, if they were in my remembrance; and many a song and many a lecherous lay; that Crist for his grete mercy foryeve me the sinne.
