# TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

## BOOK I

### 30
And with that word he lifted up his brows,  
As one should say, “Now is not this well spoken?”  
And straight these vaunts the God of Love arouse  
To wrath, of which he gives a dreadful token,  
For now he shows his bow is far from broken,  
And suddenly he hits him fair and full,  
And all such peacocks’ feathers he can pull.

### 31
O world so blind! O blind all man’s contriving!  
How often things fall out in ways contrary,  
Through vain presumption and conceited striving!  
The proud and humble both are caught unwary,  
For Troilus, who now mounts up so airy,  
Hath little thought of afterward descending;  
But folly oft hath unexpected ending.

### 32
As Bayard, when he feels his oats, grows proud,  
And dances and skips out of the travelled way,  
Until the lash upon his flank cracks loud,  
“Although I prance here first,” he then doth say,  
“A leader in the trace, and fat and gay,  
Yet am I but a horse, and by the law  
For horses made, I still must pull and draw.”

### 33
So fared it with this rash and hardy knight,  
Who was a king’s son of most high degree,  
For though he thought that nothing had the might  
To curb the heart of such a one as he,  
Yet with a look, no longer was he free,  
And he who stood but now in pride above  
All men, at once was subject most to Love.

### 34
And now I bid you profit by this man,  
Ye worthy folk, and wise and proud withal,  
And scorn not Love, he who so lightly can  
The freedom of rebellious hearts enthral;  
For still the common fate on you must fall,  
That love, at nature’s very heart indwelling,  
Shall bind all things by nature’s might compelling.

### 35
That this is true hath oftentimes been proved,  
For well you know, and in wise books may read,  
That men of greatest worth have deepest loved,  
And none so powerful in word or deed,  
But he the greater power of love must heed,  
For all his fame or high nobility;  
Thus hath it been and ever shall it be.

### 36
And fitting is it that it should be so,  
For wisest men have most with love been pleased,  
And those that dwelt in sorrow and in woe,  
By love have often been consoled and eased,  
And cruel wrath by love hath been appeased;  
For love lends lustre to an honorable name,  
And saves mankind from wickedness and shame.

### 37
And since you may not justly love deny,  
Then take it as a virtue of the mind.  
Delay not long with loving to comply,  
For love at last must all constrain and bind;  
And better the rod that bends, by force inclined,  
Than one that breaks; and therefore pray take heed  
To follow love, that best can guide and lead.

But now to leave attendant thoughts withal  
And come to Priam’s son of whom I told,  
And passing by all things collateral,  
My proper tale hereafter I shall hold,  
Both of his joy and of his cares so cold.  
And all the business of this sad affair,  
As I began, I shall to you declare.

### 39
Within the fane this knight his wit displayed,  
Wandering at will and scattering jokes about,  
And idly here, now there, his gazing strayed  
On ladies of the town and from without;  
And thus his roving eye, by chance no doubt,  
Passed o’er the crowd and reached the very spot  
Where Cressida stood, and then no further got.

### 40
And suddenly amazement came unbidden,  
As more intent he bent on her his eyes.  
“O Jupiter,” he thought, “where has she hidden,  
Whose beauty, shining bright, revealed now lies?”  
And then his heart began to swell and rise,  
But sighing soft that not a soul could hear,  
He straight again began to laugh and jeer.

### 41
Among the small, this lady seemed not small,  
She had a figure of proportioned kind,  
Yet not the slightest mannish or too tall,  
For nature had her frame so well designed,  
And all her motions showed so well her mind,  
That men could tell, in such there would reside  
Honor and dignity and woman’s pride.

### 42
And Troilus, the more he saw, the more  
Was pleased with all her form and features clear,  
But still she kept her eyes upon the floor,  
Except she let one scornful glance appear,  
As much as “Well, why shouldn’t I stand here?”  
But soon her eyes again grew soft and bright,  
Which seemed to Troilus a goodly sight.

### 43
From eyes to heart in Troilus there passed  
So great a longing, through this vision bred,  
That in his deepest soul, fixed firm and fast,  
This lady’s image love did now imbed;  
And he who once had held so high his head  
Must now draw in his horns and hold him low,  
As one who knows not where to turn or go.

### 44
Lo, he who ne’er before had known defeat,  
And scorned all who in Love’s dominion lie,  
He little was aware that love its seat  
Hath in the glance and beaming of the eye;  
Yet suddenly he felt within him die  
All haughtiness of heart, by looking hurt,  
And bless’d be love, which can men thus convert!  
Thus still he stood, where he could well behold  
This one in black, who hath his heart enchained.

### 45
She, this in black, likening to Troilus,  
Over all things he stood for to behold;  
Ne his desire, ne wherefore he stood thus,  
He neither cheer made, nor word told;  
But from afar, his manner for to hold,  
On other things his look some time he cast,  
And eft on her, while that the service lasted.

### 46
And afterward, not dead but deadly smitten,  
Out of the temple quietly he went,  
Repenting him that he had ever japed  
Of loves folk, lest fully the descent  
Of scorn fell on himself; but, what he meant,  
Lest it were wist on any manner side,  
His wo he gan dissemble and hide.

### 47
When he was from the temple thus departed,  
He straight anon unto his palace turneth,  
Right with her look through-shoten and through-darted,  
All feigneth he in lust that he sojourneth;  
And all his cheer and speech also he borneth;  
And ay, of loves servants every while,  
Himself to wrye, at hem he gan to smile.

### 48
“Good Lord,” he says, “you lovers are well paid!  
See how the cleverest one among you all,  
Whose duty is most faithfully displayed,  
Must bear the whips and scorns that on you fall!  
You get your pay, if pay one can it call,  
Not good for good, but scorn for duty done;  
In faith, your order is a goodly one!”

### 49
“How vain are all your worship and your rites,  
What small return you get for prayer or plea!  
Your creed demands attendance days and nights,  
No other asks such assiduity.  
From folly love indeed is never free;  
If I should tell all love’s absurdities,  
You’d call them slanders and base calumnies.”

### 50
“But lo, the things you lovers oft eschew,  
Or what you do with very best intent,  
Your lady will be sure to misconstrue,  
And say she knows it was not kindly meant,  
Whatever cause she has for discontent —  
Or none; she always holds the whip in hand.  
How lucky they who join your happy band!”

### 51
But nevertheless, when he found good occasion,  
He held his peace, the best thing he could do!  
For Love had clipped his wings, and no evasion  
Could help his case. Yet many a tale untrue  
He told his friends why he from them withdrew,  
Or if they noted his abstracted airs,  
He told them just to mind their own affairs.

### 52
When in his room at last he was alone,  
He sat down at the foot-end of his bed,  
And first began to sigh and then to moan,  
And then, through waking visions in his head  
By fancy and imagination bred,  
He dreamed he saw her near the temple door,  
In form and shape as she had been before.

### 53
And then he made a mirror of his mind,  
In which he saw her features all complete,  
And thought perhaps occasion he might find  
For such a lady’s favor to compete,  
And maybe might with her approval meet,  
Or win from her at least sufficient grace  
To grant to him a humble servant’s place.

### 54
And he surmised the effort were not vain,  
That in her goodly service he might spend,  
And love for such a one, he dared maintain,  
If it were known, all persons would commend,  
Especially those whose hopes on love depend —  
This was at first his line of argument.

### 55
Thus took he purpose Love’s craft to sue,  
And thought he would work privately,  
First, to hide his desire in mute disguise  
From every wight about, altogether,  
But he might be somewhat recovered thereby;  
Remembering him that love too widely blown  
Yields bitter fruit, though sweetest seed be sown.

### 56
And over all this, yet much more he thought  
What to speak, and what to hold within,  
And what to order her to love he sought,  
And on a song anon-right to begin,  
And gan loud on his sorrow for to win;  
For with good hope he gan fully assent  
Criseyde for to love, and nought repent.

### 57
And of his song not only the sentence,  
As writ my author called Lollius,  
But plainly, save our tongues’ difference,  
I dare well say in all that Troilus  
Said in his song; lo! every word right thus  
As I shall say; and who so list it here,  
Lo! next this verse, he may it finden here.

*The Song of Troilus*

> If love is naught, O God, why feel I so?  
> If love is aught, what nature then hath he?  
> If love is good, whence cometh all my woe?  
> If love is bad, it seems then strange to me,  
> How every torment and adversity  
> That comes from love, itself with joy doth link,  
> For still I thirst the more, the more I drink.
> 
> 
> “And if I burn but with my own desire,  
> Whence comes my lamentation and my plaint?  
> Why should I grieve, when I with grief conspire?  
> And why should I unweary be, yet faint?  
> O living death! O grief so sweet and quaint!  
> How can it come that love should in me grow  
> Except that I consent it shall be so?
> 
> 
> “If I consent, with wrong I then complain;  
> Behold how to and fro I merely toss,  
> All steerless within a boat am I  
> Amid the sea, betwixt the winds that cross,  
> That in contraries do evermore stand.  
> Alas! what is this wonder malady?  
> For heat of cold, for cold of heat, I die.
> 
> 
> “Then to the God of Love anon he spake  
> With plaintive voice, ‘Thou, Lord, who solely hast  
> Taken my heart, and rightly dost it take,  
> I thank thee, Lord, for all that now hath passed!  
> For now that I have found my love at last,  
> My homage to her shall I ne’er deny,  
> But as her man, I still shall live and die!
> 
> 
> “‘In her esteem thou hold’st a lofty place,  
> And for thy power such is rightly thine,  
> And therefore, Lord, turn not from me thy face,  
> But be thou gracious to me and benign;  
> For now my royal rank I all resign  
> Into her hands, and humbly standing here,  
> Become her man, and she my lady dear!’”
> 
> 
> No favor to his royal rank Love showed,  
> For from this flame no rank can ever save,  
> Nor parted from his customary mode,  
> For all he was a knight so bold and brave,  
> But held him in distress as thrall and slave,  
> And burned him in so many ways and new,  
> That sixty times a day he changed his hue.

### 64
So much, day by day, his quickening thought  
Now dwelt on her, and love thereby increase,  
That every other usual task he set at naught;  
Yet often strove to make his burning cease  
By sight of her, in hope to find release  
From this uneasy burden that he bore —  
But ever the nearer, ever he loved the more.

### 65
For ever the nearer, the hotter is the fire —  
And this, I trow, knoweth all this company.  
Whether far or near, I dare well say this,  
By night or day, for wisdom or for folly,  
His heart, which that is lodged in his breast,  
Was aye on her, that fairer was to see  
Than ever was Helen or Polyxena.

### 66
And of the day there passed no single hour  
But to himself a thousand times he said,  
“Good gracious one, to whom I serve and labor,  
As I best can, now would God, Criseyde,  
Ye would on me have pity ere that I died!  
My dear heart, alas! my health and hue  
And life is lost, but ye would on me rewe!”

### 67
All other dread from him was fled away,  
Both of the siege and of his reputation;  
Nor in him did any other fancy breed  
But arguments to this conclusion,  
That she on him would have compassion,  
And he to be her man, while he may endure;  
Lo, here his life, and from the death his cure!

### 68
Not Hector’s nor his other brothers’ feats  
Of arms, in many sharp attacks well proved,  
Stirred him to such like charges or retreats;  
Yet nevertheless, wherever peril moved,  
There was he found, and as he fiercely loved,  
So fiercely fought, such wondrous deeds achieving,  
They seemed to men almost beyond believing.

### 69
But not for hatred of the Greeks he raged,  
Nor yet to aid the rescue of the town,  
But mightily in arms he battle waged  
For this sole end, to cast opponents down  
And win his lady’s favor by renown;  
And so his warlike valor shone so splendid,  
That fear of death on all the Greeks descended.

### 70
And love that made him bold, made him to sleep  
The less, and still his multiplying sorrow  
Such hold upon his heart and soul doth keep,  
It stood revealed with each returning morrow  
Upon his face, and he was fain to borrow  
The name of other ill, lest men might know  
It was the fire of love that changed him so.

### 71
He said he had a fever, was not well,  
Whatever shyness makes a man to say,  
But to his lady not a word could tell;  
Although perhaps she guessed it anyway;  
The fact remained, he got but little pay  
For all his service, since she gave no thought  
To what he had or what he hadn’t wrought.

### 72
And then there fell on him another woe  
From which his troubled mind could not be freed,  
The fear that she might love another so  
That his poor suit she would in no wise heed;  
But though the thought made him at heart to bleed,  
Yet never a move, for all the world to win,  
To make his sorrow known durst he begin.

### 73
Thus to himself he often would complain,  
And say, “O fool, now art thou in the snare  
Who once did jest at love and all its pain!  
Now art thou caught! Now go and gnaw thy chain!  
Thou once wert wont that love to reprehend  
From which thyself thou canst not now defend.

What will now every lover say of thee,  
If this be known, when thou art out of sight,  
But laugh in scorn and say, ‘Lo, there goes he  
Who thought he dwelt alone on wisdom’s height,  
And held all lovers in such low despite!

But now, thank God, his place is in the dance  
Of those whom Love delayeth to advance.’

But O, thou woful Troilus, would God  
(Since love thou must, by thy sad destiny)  
That one who knows thy woe should hold the rod  
O’er thee, although no pity in her be!  
But cold in love thy lady is to thee, ...”

### 74–75
(Continuation of Troilus’s inward lament and the manifestation of his sorrow outwardly: his hue and manner are changed; his affliction shows itself both evening and morning, and his great anxiety attends him continually.)

## BOOK I

Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe  
Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende  
That the hote fyr of love him brende.

71

And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;  
But how it was, certayn, can I not seye.  
If that his lady understood not this,  
Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;  
But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,  
Ne semed it that she of him roughte,  
Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte.

72

But than fel to this Troylus such wo,  
That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede  
Was this, that she som wight had loved so,  
That never of him she wolde have taken hede;  
For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede.  
Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne  
To tellen it, for al this world to winne.

73

But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,  
Thus to himself ful ofte he gan to pleyne;  
He sayde, “O fool, now art thou in the snare,  
That whilom japedest at loves peyne;  
Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne;  
Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende  
Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende.

74

What wole now every lover seyn of thee,  
If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence  
Laughen in scorn, and seyn, ‘Lo, ther gooth he,  
That is the man of so gret sapience,  
That held us loveres leest in reverence!  
Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce  
Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce.’  
75

But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde,  
Sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee,  
That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde  
Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee:  
But al so cold in love, towardes thee.

Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone,  
And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone.

76

God wolde I were aryved in the port  
Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede!  
A, lord, to me it were a greet comfort;  
Then were I quit of languisshing in drede.  
For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede  
I shal bi-japed been a thousand tyme  
More than that fool of whos folye men ryme.

77

But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom  
I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste!  
O mercy, dere herte, and help me from  
The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste,  
More than my-self wol love yow to my laste.  
And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete  
Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!

78

This wordes and ful manye an-other to  
He spak, and called ever in his compleynte  
Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo,  
Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte.  
Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;  
And whan that he bithoughte on that folye,  
A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye.

79

Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone,  
A freend of his, that called was Pandare,  
Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,  
And sey his freend in swich distresse and care:  
“Allas!” quod he, “who causeth al this fare?  
O mercy, god! what unhap may this mene?  
Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?

80

Or hastow som remors of conscience,  
And art now falle in som devocioun,  
And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,  
And hast for ferde caught attricioun?  
God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,  
And so can leye our jolytee on presse,  
And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!”

81

These wordes seyde he for the nones alle,  
That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken,  
And with an angre don his sorwe falle.  
As for the tyme, and his corage awaken;  
But wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken,  
Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse  
Than he, ne more desired worthinesse.

82

“What cas,” quod Troilus, “cor what aventure  
Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge,  
That am refus of every creature?  
But for the love of god, at my preyinge,  
Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge  
Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye;  
Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye.

83

But if thou wene I be thus syk for drede,  
It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought;

> As frost is cold beneath the winter moon;  
> Like snow in flame, so thou must perish soon!

76

> “Would God I were arrived safe in the port  
> Of death, to which my sorrow will me lead!  
> That were for me the best and last resort,  
> Then were I of all fear and longing freed!  
> But if my hidden sorrow men should heed,  
> I shall be marked and mocked a great deal more  
> Than any fool for folly famed before!

77

> “Now help, O God, and help, my lady sweet,  
> I am your prisoner caught and none so fast!  
> Have mercy now, and help me to defeat  
> This death! And I, until my days are past,  
> With more than life will love you to the last.  
> Now with some kindly glance my heart restore,  
> Although you never grant me favor more!”

78

These words, and more, within his room he spake,  
And begged his lady, in his grief profound,  
Some recognition of his love to make,  
And wept salt tears in which he nearly drowned—  
But all in vain, for not a single sound  
She heard, not being present to so him binde,  
Which made his griefs a thousandfold to grow.

79

Lamenting in his chambre thus allone,  
A freend of his, that called was Pandare,  
Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone,  
And sey his freend in swich distresse and care:  
“Allas!” quod he, “who causeth al this fare?  
O mercy, God! what unhap may this mene?  
Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene?

80

“Or hastow som remors of conscience,  
And art now falle in som devocioun,  
And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence,  
And hast for ferde caught attricioun?  
God save hem that bi-seged han our toun,  
And so can leye our jolytee on presse,  
And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!”

81

He spak these wordes, as I them to you seye,  
That Troilus to anger might be stirred,  
And sorrow thus to anger giving way,  
To deeds of courage once again be spurred;  
For well he knew, and well all men had heard,  
There was among the Trojans none more bold,  
Or none whom men in higher honor hold.

82

“What chance,” said Troilus, “what accident,  
Hath led thee here to see my wretched state,  
Where I deserted and alone lament?  
But for God’s sake, don’t linger here too late,  
But get thee gone, for surely my sad fate  
Will be a painful sight, since I must die!  
Then go, and let me here untroubled lie.

83

“But if you think that I am sick from fear,  
It is not so, and therefore scorn me naught.

There’s something else that touches me more near  
Than anything the Greeks as yet have wrought,  
And brings on me this sad and mortal thought.  
But though I may not now to thee confide it,  
Please don’t be vexed, ’tis best that I should hide it.”

84

Then Pandar, yearning for this hapless youth,  
Replied and said, “Alas, what can this be?  
Good friend, if faithful love or constant truth  
Now is or ever was betwixt thee and me,  
Then do not treat me with such cruelty!  
A confidential ear I’ll gladly lend,  
For don’t forget that Pandar is thy friend.

85

“And I will gladly share with you your pain,  
If it turn out I can no comfort bring;  
For ’tis a friend’s right, please let me explain,  
To share in woful as in joyful thing.  
Through true or false report, I still shall cling  
To you in faith forever firm and fast;  
So tell your woe, for tell you must at last.”

86

Troilus heaved a deep and mournful sigh,  
And said to him, “Perhaps it may be best  
If with your friendly wish I should comply,  
And tear my secret from my aching breast,  
Though well I know you can bring me no rest.  
But lest you think I have no trust in thee,  
I’ll tell thee, friend, just how it stands with me.

87

“Lo, Love, against which he who most defendeth  
Himself, the more thereby his effort faileth,  
This Love so far his rule o’er me extendeth,  
That now my heart to death a straight course saileth!  
Love-longing over me so deep prevaileth,  
That here to die for Love were greater joy  
Than be both King of Greece and King of Troy.

88

“Suffiseth this, my full friend Pandare,  
That I have seyd; for now wostow my wo;  
And for the love of God, my cold care  
So hid it well, I telle it never to mo;  
For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two,  
If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,  
And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.”

89

“How hastow thus unkindely and longe  
Hid this fro me, thou fool?” quod Pandarus;  
“Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe  
That myn avys anoon may helpen us.”

“This were a wonder thing,” quod Troilus,  
“Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;  
How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?”

90

“Ye, Troilus, now herke,” quod Pandare,  
“Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,  
That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare  
By good counseyl can kepen his freend therfro.  
I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go  
Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde;  
A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde.

Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede  
Way more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought,  
Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought.  
But though that I now telle thee it ne leste,  
Be thou nought wrooth, I hyde it for the beste.”

84

This Pandarc, that neigh melt for wo and routhe,  
Ful ofte seyde, “allas! what may this be?  
Now freend,” quod he, “if ever love or trouthe  
Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me,  
Ne do thou never swich a crueltee  
To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care;  
Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare?

85

I wol parten with thee al thy peyne,  
If it be so I do thee no comfort bring;  
As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne,  
To entreparten wo, as glad desport.  
I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report,  
In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve;  
Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.”

86

Then gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,  
And seyde him thus, “God leve it be my beste  
To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee lyke,  
Yet wol I telle it, though myn herte breste;  
And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste.  
But lest thou deme I truste not to thee,  
Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me.

87

Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth  
Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth,  
With desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth,  
That streyght unto the deeth myn herte sayleth.  
Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assaylleth,  
That to ben slayn it were a gretter joye  
To me than king of Grece been and Troye!

88

Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare,  
That I have seyd, for now wostow my wo;  
And for the love of God, my colde care  
So hid it wel, I telle it never to mo;  
For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two.  
If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse,  
And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.”

89

“How hastow thus unkindely and longe  
Hid this fro me, thou fool?” quod Pandarus;  
“Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe  
That myn avys anoon may helpen us.”

“This were a wonder thing,” quod Troilus,  
“Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse;  
How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?”

90

“Ye, Troilus, now herke,” quod Pandare,  
“Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so,  
That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare  
By good counseyl can kepen his freend therfro.  
I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go  
Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde;  
A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde.

91

A whetston is no kerving instrument,  
And yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis.  
And ther thou woost that I have ought miswent,  
Eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is;  
Thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis.  
If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared;  
By his contrarie is every thing declared.

92

For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe  
To him that never tasted bitternesse?  
Ne no man may be inly glad, I trowe,  
That never was in sorwe or som distresse;  
Eek whit by blak, by shame eek worthinesse,  
Ech set by other, more for other semeth;  
As men may see; and so the wyse it demeth.

93

Sith thus of two contraries is a lore,  
I, that have in love so ofte assayed  
Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more  
Counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed.  
Eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed.  
Though I desire with thee for to bere  
Thyn hevy charge; it shal thee lasse dere.

94

I woot wel that it fareth thus by me  
As to thy brother Parys an herdesse,  
Which that y-cleped was Oenone,  
Wroot in a compleynt of hir hevinesse:  
Ye sey the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?”  
“Nay, never yet, ywis,” quod Troilus.  
“Now,” quod Pandare, “herkneth; it was thus.

95

‘Phebus, that first fond art of medicyne,’  
Quod she, ‘and coude in every wightes care  
Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fyne.  
Yet to himself his conninge was ful bare;  
For love hadde him so bounden in a snare,  
Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete,  
That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete.’

96

Right so fare I, unhappily for me;  
I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore;  
And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee,  
And not my-self; repreve me no more.  
I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore  
As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleye.  
But to thyn help yet somwhat can I seye.

97

And of o thing right siker maystow be,  
That certayn, for to deyen in the peyne,  
That I shal never-mo discoveren thee;  
Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreyne  
Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleyne,  
That is thy brotheres wyf, if ich it wiste;  
Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste.

98

Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure,  
And tel me plat what is thyn enchesoun,  
And final cause of wo that ye endure;  
For douteth no-thing, myn entencioun  
Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun  
In this affaire; for no man may prevent  
A man from loving, er that his losse is spent.

99

And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vyces,  
Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve;  
But wel I woot, the mene of it no vyce is,  
For for to trusten sum wight is a preve  
Of trouthe, and for-thy wolde I fayn remeve  
Thy wrong conceite, and do thee som wight tryste  
Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste.

100

The wyse seyth, ‘wo him that is allone,  
For, and he falle, he hath noon help to ryse;’  
And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone;  
For this nis not, certeyn, the nexte wyse  
To winnen love, as techen us the wyse,  
To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,  
Whos teres yet in marbel been y-sene.

101

Lat be thy weping and thy drerinesse,  
And lat us lissen wo with other speche;  
So may thy woful tyme seme lesse.  
Delyte not in wo thy wo to seche,  
As doon thise foleis that hir sorwes eche  
With sorwe, whan they han misaventure,  
And listen nought to seche hem other cure.

102

Men seyn, ‘to wrecche is consolacioun  
To have another felawe in his peyne;’  
That oughte wel ben our opinioun,  
For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleyne;  
So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne,  
That certeynly no more harde grace  
May sitte on me, for-why ther is no space.

103

If God wol, thou art not agast of me,  
Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigyle;  
Thou wost thy-self whom that I love, pardee,  
As I best can, gon sithen longe while.  
And sith thou wost I do it for no wyle,  
And sith I am he that thou tristest most,  
Tel me somwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.”

104

Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde,  
But longe he lay as stille as he ded were;  
And after this with sykinge he abreyde,  
And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere.  
And up his eyen caste he, that in fere  
Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesye  
He sholde falle, or elles sone dye:

105

And cryde “awake” ful wonderly and sharpe;  
“What? slombrestow as in a lytargye?  
Or artow lyk an asse to the harpe,  
That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plye,  
But in his minde of that no melodye  
May sinken him to glade, for that he  
So dul is of his bestialitee?”

106

And with that Pandare of his wordes stente;  
But Troilus yet him no word answerde.

107

For-why to telle nas not his entente  
To never no man, for whom that he so ferde.  
For it is seyd, “man maketh ofte a yerde  
With which the maker is him-self y-beten  
In sondry maner,” as thise wyse tretten,  
And namely, in his counseyl tellinge  
That toucheth love that oughte be secree;  
For of him-self it wolde y-nough out-springe,  
But if that it the bet governed be.  
Hek som-tyme it is craft to seme flee  
Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste;  
Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste.

108

But nathelees, whan he hadde herd him crye  
“Awake!” he gan to syke wonder sore,  
And seyde, “freend, though that I stille lye,  
I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more;  
For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore;  
But suffre me my mischef to biwayle,  
For thy proverbes may me nought avayle.

109

Nor other cure canstow noon for me.  
Eek I nil not be cured, I wol deye;  
What knowe I of the quene Niobe?  
Lat be thyne olde ensaumples, I thee preye.”

110

“No,” quod tho Pandarus, “therefore I seye,  
Swich is delyt of foles to biwepe  
Hir wo, but seken bote they ne kepe.  
Now knowe I that ther reson in thee fayleth.  
But tel me, if I wiste what she were  
For whom that thee al this misauenture ayleth,  
Dorstestow that I tolde hir in hir ere  
Thy wo, sith thou darst not thy-self for fere,  
And hir bisoughte on thee to han som routhe?”

111

“Why, nay,” quod he, “by God and by my trouthe!  
What? not as bisily,” quod Pandarus,  
“As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede?”  
“No, certes, brother,” quod this Troilus.  
“And why?” — “For that thou sholdest never spede.”  
“Wostow that wel?” — “Ye, that is out of drede,”  
Quod Troilus, “for al that ever ye conne,  
She nil to noon swich wrecche as I be wonne.”

112

Quod Pandarus, “allas! what may this be,  
That thou despeyred art thus causeles?  
What? liveth not thy lady? benedicite!  
How wostow so that thou art gracelees?  
Swich yvel is not alwey boteless.  
Why, put not impossible thus thy cure,  
Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure.

113

I graunte wel that thou endurest wo  
As sharp as doth he, Ticius, in helle,  
Whos stomak foules tyren ever-mo  
That highte volturis, as bokes telle.  
But I may not endure that thou dwelle  
In so unskilful an opinioun  
That of thy wo is no curacioun.

114

“If thou refuse to tell, for faint heart,  
And for thy sloth and foolish wilfulness,  
And wilt no slightest hint to me impart,  
And why I should not help in thy distress  
Thou wilt not give a reason more or less,  
But supine on thy bed thyself stretch—  
I ask, what woman could love such a wretch?

115

“And how can she account then for thy death,  
If thou thus die, and she knows nothing why,  
Except for fear thou breathedst thy last breath  
Because the Greeks about our city lie?  
What figure wilt thou cut in the world’s eye?  
Then she and all will say in scornful tones,  
‘The wretch is dead, the devil have his bones.’

116

“You may here weep alone and pray and kneel,  
But if the one you love of this knows naught,  
How can she make return that you can feel—  
Unknown, unkissed and lost, who is unsought!  
Lo, many a man his love hath dearly bought,  
And twenty years opined were not too much  
To win the right his lady’s lips to touch.

117

“But should he therefore fall in dark despair,  
Or as a recreant himself demean,  
Or slay himself, because his lady’s fair?  
No, no, let love be ever fresh and green,  
Let each forever cherish his heart’s queen,  
And think it is love’s guerdon but to serve,  
A thousandfold more than he doth deserve.”

118

To these wise words then Troilus took heed,  
And saw the state of mind that he was in,  
And thought what Pandar said was true indeed,  
That just to die would not his lady win.  
But would be both unmanly and a sin,  
And useless, too, in every jot and tittle,  
Since of his wo she knew still less than little.

119

At this sad thought, he sighed both loud and long,  
And said, “Alas, what’s best for me to do?”  
And Pandar answered him, “You can’t go wrong  
In telling me your story whole and true;  
I give my word, within a day or two,  
I’ll bring you news, the best you ever got,  
Or have me drawn and quartered on the spot.”

120

“That’s what you say,” cried Troilus, “alas,  
But saying so, that will not make it so!”

## BOOK I

For my affairs have come to such a pass  
That I perceive that Fortune is my foe,  

And all who up and down this wide world go,  
Must take whatever Fortune shall decree,  
For as she will, she plays with bound and free.”

121

“So then,” said Pandar, “Fortune is to blame  
For your own feelings! Now — at last I see!  
But don’t you know that Fortune is the same  
To all alive, in varying degree?  
But of one comfort you have certainty,

> But ones niltow, for thy coward herte.  
> And for thyn ire and folish wilfulnesse,  
> For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte,  
> Ne to thyn owene help do bisinesse  
> As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse,  
> But lyest as he that list of no-thing recche.  
> What womman coude love swich a wrecche?  
> What may she demen other of thy deeth,  
> If thou thus deye, and she not why it is,  
> But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth,  
> For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis?  
> Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this!  
> Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones,  
> ‘The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!’  

116

Thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele;  
But, love a woman that she woot it nought.  
And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele;  
Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is unsought.  
What! many a man hath love ful dere y-bought  
Twenty winter that his lady wiste,  
That never yet his lady mouth he kiste.

117

What? shulde he therfor fallen in despeyr,  
Or be recreaunt for his owene tene,  
Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr?  
Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene  
To serve and love his dere hertes quene,  
And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve  
A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.”

118

And of that word took hede Troilus,  
And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,  
And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,  
That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne.  
But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,  
And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;  
For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte.

119

And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,  
And seyde, “Alas! what is me best to do?”  
To whom Pandare answerde, “If thee lykke,  
The best is that thou telle me thy wo;  
And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,  
I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,  
To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!”

120

“Ye, so thou seyst,” quod Troilus tho, “alas!  
But, god wot, it is not the rather so;  
Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,  
For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,  
Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go  
May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;  
For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.”

121

Quod Pandarus, “than blamestow Fortune  
For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;  
Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune  
To every maner wight in som degree?  
And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee!

> That, as hir joyes moten over-goon,  
> So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon.

122

For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne,  
Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be:  
Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may sojorne,  
What wostow if hir mutabilitee  
Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee,  
Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge?  
Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe!

123

And therfor wostow what I thee beseche?  
Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde;  
For who-so list have helping of his leche,  
To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde.  
To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde.  
Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe,  
By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe.

124

Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is  
Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede;  
Knowe ich hir ought? for my love, tel me this;  
Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.”

Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,  
For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;  
“A ha!” quod Pandare, “here biginneth game!”

125

And with that word he gan him for to shake,  
And seyde, “theef, thou shalt hir name telle.”  
But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake  
As though men sholde han lad him into helle,  
And seyde, “Alas! of al my wo the welle,  
Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!”  
And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde.

126

And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,  
Lord, he was glad, and seyde, “Freend so dere,  
Now fare a-right, for Joves name in hevene.  
Love hath biset thee wel, be of good chere;  
For of good name and wysdom and manere  
She hath y-nough, and eek of gentilesse;  
If she be fayr, thou wost thy-self, I gesse.

127

Ne I never saw a more bountevous  
Of hir estat, ne a gladder, ne of speche  
A freendlier, ne a more gracious  
For to do wel, ne lasse hadde nede to seche  
What for to doon; and al this bet to eche,  
In honour, to as fer as she may strecche,  
A kinges herte semeth by hires a wrecche.

128

And for-thy loke of good comfort thou be;  
For certeinly, the firste poynt is this  
Of noble corage and wel ordeyne,  
A man to have pees with him-self, y-wis;  
So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is  
To loven wel, and in a worthy place;  
Thee oughte not to clepe it hap, but grace.

129

And also thenk, and ther-with glade thee,  
That sith thy lady vertuous is al,  
So folweth it that ther is some pitee  
Amonges alle thise othere in general.  
But tak thou heed, whatever may befall,  
That thou dishonour not an honest name,  
For vertu streccheth not him-self to shame.

130

“But wel is me that ever I was born,  
That thou biset art in so good a place;  
For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn,  
Thee sholde never han tyme thus fayr a grace;  
And wostow why? for thou were wont to chace  
At love in scorn, and for despyt him calle  
‘Seynt Idiot, lord of thise foles alle.’

131

How often hastow maad thy nyce japes,  
And seyd, that loves servants everichone  
Of nycetee ben verray goddes apes;  
And some wolde monche hir mete alone,  
Ligging a-bedde, and make hem for to grone;  
And som, thou seydest, hadde a blaunche fevere,  
And preydest God he sholde never kevere!

132

And some of hem toke on hem, for the colde,  
More than y-nough, so seydestow ful ofte;  
And some han feyned ofte tyme, and tolde  
How that they wake, whan they slepen softe;  
And thus they wolde han brought hem-self alofte,  
And nathelees were under at the laste;  
Thus seydestow, and japedest ful faste.

133

Yet seydestow, that, for the more part,  
These loveres wolden speke in general,  
And thoughten that it was a siker art  
For fayling, for to assayen overal.  
Now may I jape of thee, if that I shall;  
But nathelees, though that I sholde deye,  
That thou art noon of tho, that dorste I seye.

134

Now beet thy brest, and sey to God of love,  
‘Thy grace, lord! for now I me repente  
If I mis spak, for now my-self I love’:  
Thus sey with al thyn herte in good entente.”

Quod Troilus, “A! lord! I me consente,  
And pray to thee my japes thou foryive,  
And I shal never-more while I live.”

135

“Thow seyst wel,” quod Pandare, “and now I hope  
That thou the goddes wratthe hast al apesed;  
And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope,  
And seyd swich thing wher-with thy god is plesed,  
Now wolde never god but thou were esed;  
And think wel, she of whom rist al thy wo  
Here-after may thy comfort been al-so.

136

For thilke ground, that bereth the wedes wikke,  
Bereth eek these holsom herbes, as ful ofte;  
Next the foule netle, rough and thikke,  
The rose waxeth swote and smothe and softe;  
And next the valey is the hil a-lofte;  
And next the derke night the glade morwe;  
And also joye is next the fyn of sorwe.

137

Now loke that atempre be thy brydel,  
And, for the beste, ay suffre to the tyde,  
Or elles al our labour is on ydel;  
He hasteth wel that wysly can abyde;  
Be diligent, and trewe, and ay wel hyde.  
Be lusty, free, persevere in thy servyse,  
And al is wel, if thou werke in this wyse.

138

But he that parted is in every place  
Is nowher hool, as writen clerkes wyse;  
What wonder is, though swich oon have no grace?  
Wostow how it fareth of som servyse?  
As plaunte a tre or herbe, in sondry wyse,  
And on the morwe pulle it up as blyve,  
No wonder is, though it may never thryve.

139

And sith that god of love hath thee bistowed  
In place digne unto thy worthinesse,  
Stond faste, for to good port hastow rowed;  
And of thy-self, for any hevinesse,  
Hope alwey wel; for, but-if drerinesse  
Or over-haste our bothe labour shende,  
I hope of this to maken a good ende.

140

And wostow why I am the lasse afered  
Of this matere with my nece trete?  
For this have I herd seyd of wyse y-lered,  
‘Was never man ne woman yet bigete  
That was unapt to suffren loves hete  
Celestial, or elles love of kinde;’  
For-thy som grace I hope in hir to finde.

141

And for to speke of hir in special,  
Hir beautee to bithinken and hir youthe,  
It sit hir nought to be celestial  
As yet, though that hir liste bothe and couthe;  
But trewely, it sete hir wel right nouthe  
A worthy knight to loven and cheryce.  
And but she do, I holde it for a vyce.

142

Wherfore I am, and wol be, ay redy  
To peyne me to do yow this servyse;  
For bothe yow to plese thus hope I  
Her-afterward; for ye beth bothe wyse,  
And conne it counseyl kepe in swich a wyse  
That no man shal the wyser of it be;  
And so we may be gladed alle three.

143

And, by my trouthe, I have right now of thee  
A good conceyt in my wit, as I gesse,  
And what it is, I wol now that thou see.  
I thenke, sith that love, of his goodnesse,  
Hath thee converted out of wikkednesse,  
That thou shalt be the beste post, I leve,  
Of al his lay, and most his foos to-greve.

144

Ensample why, see now these wyse clerkes,  
That erren aldermost ayein a lawe,  
And ben converted from hir wikked werkes  
Thorugh grace of God, that list hem to him drawe.  
Than am they folk that han most God in awe;  
And growe into his most believing band.  
For they knowe best all error to withstand.

145

Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented  
To been his help in loving of Criseyde,  
Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,  
But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde  
With sobre chere, al-though his herte pleyde,  
“Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve,  
Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve.

146

But, dere frend, how shal myn wo ben lesse  
Til this be doon? and goode, eek tel me this.  
How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse?  
Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, y-wis.  
Or nil not here or trowen how it is.  
Al this drede I, and eek for the manere  
Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.”

147

Quod Pandarus, “thou hast a ful gret care  
Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone!  
Why, lord! I hate of thee thy nyce fare!  
Why, entremete of that thou hast to done!  
For goddes love, I bidde thee a bone.  
So lat me alone, and it shal be thy beste.”

148

“Why, freend,” quod he, “now do right as thee leste.  
But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde  
That thou in me wendest so greet folye,  
That to my lady I desiren sholde  
That toucheth harm or any vilenye;  
For dredeles, me were lever dye  
Than she of me ought elles understode  
But that, that mighte sounen into gode.”

149

Tho lough this Pandare, and anoon answerde,  
“And I thy borw? fy! no wight dooth but so;  
I rought nought though that she stode and herde  
How that thou seyst; but fare-wel, I wol go.  
A-dieu! be glad! God spede us bothe two!  
Yif me this labour and this besinesse,  
And of my speed be thyn al that swetnesse.”

150

Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle,  
And Pandare in his armes hente faste,  
And seyde, “now, fy on the Grekes alle!  
Yet, pardee, God shal helpe us at the laste;  
And dredeles, if that my lyf may laste,  
And God to-fom, lo, som of hem shal smerte;  
And yet me athinketh that this avaunt me astertel.

151

Now, Pandare, I can no more seye.  
But thou wys, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art al!  
My lyf, my deeth, hool in thyn honde I leye;  
Help now,” quod he. “Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.”  
“God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,”  
Quod Troilus, “that thou me recomaunde  
To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.”

152

This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve  
His fulc freend, than seyde in this manere,  
“Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;  
Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.” —  
And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,  
And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,  
And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place.

153

For every wight that hath an hous to founde  
Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne  
With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,  
And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne  
Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.  
Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,  
And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte.

154

But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,  
But up anoon upon his stede bay,  
And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;  
Wo was that Greek that with him mette that day.  
And in the toun his maner tho forth ay  
So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,  
That ech him lovede that loked on his face.

155

For he bicom the frendlyeste wight,  
The gentileste, and eek the moste free,  
The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,  
That in his tyme was, or mighte be.  
Dede were his japes and his crueltee,  
His heighe port and his manere estraunge,  
And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge.

156

Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,  
That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore,  
And is somdel of akinge of his wounde  
Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more;  
And, as an esy pacient, the lore  
Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;  
And thus he dryveth forth his aventure.

---

For as all joys on earth are short and brief,  
So time will bring for sorrow its relief.

122

“Because if Fortune’s wheel should cease to turn,  
Then Fortune she at once no more would be;  
And since in no fixed place she may sojourn,  
It may chance, by mere mutability,  
Such good luck she hath now in store for thee,  
And such a boon to thee she soon will bring,  
That for the joy of it, thy heart shall sing.

123

“And therefore do you know what I advise?  
Look up! Don’t keep your eyes upon the ground!  
The sick must first unto the doctor’s eyes  
Reveal in what respect he is unsound.  
To Cerberus in hell may I be bound,  
If my own sister were thy cause of sorrow,  
For all of me, she should be thine tomorrow.

124

“If I had something clear on which to go,  
I’d surely find the remedy you need.  
At least say this, your lady do I know?  
For if I do, the fight is on indeed!”

Then Troilus at heart began to bleed.  
For he was hit, and blushed with rosy shame;  
“Aha!” cried Pandar, “now I smell the game!”

125

And then his victim he began to shake,  
And said, “You thief, her name you’ve got to tell!”  
Then hapless Troilus, with many a quake,  
As though his soul were being led to hell,  
Murmured, “Of all my woe the source and well  
Is Cressida — and now you know her name!”  
And with these words, he almost died for shame.

126

When Pandar heard who was his lady love,  
Then he was glad and said, “My friend so dear,  
Now all goes well, for by great Jove above,  
You’re lucky in your choice. Be of good cheer!  
Of fame, wisdom and virtue never fear;  
She hath enough, and also gentle ways;  
Her beauty you know, and I need not to praise.

127

“She hath besides a free and open hand  
With all she owns, is affable in speech,  
And how to do things well doth understand,  
Yet never doth in doing overreach,  
But gracious are her manners all and each.  
Such truth and honor in her heart abide,  
A king’s heart seems a poor thing there beside.

128

“Good reason now you have to be content,  
For half the battle is already gained  
When courage dull inaction doth prevent,  
And peace of heart within has been attained;  
For love with every good is deep ingrained  
When it is set upon a worthy place,  
It is no evil then, but heaven’s grace.

129

“You have this reason to be glad besides,  
That since your lady hath these virtues all,  
Then pity, also, in her heart resides  
Among these other things in general.  
But take thou heed, whatever may befall,  
That thou dishonour not an honest name,  
For virtue stretcheth not itself to shame.

130

“But well is me that ever I was born,  
That thou beset art in so good a place;  
For by my troth, in love I dared have sworn,  
Thou shouldst never have had time thus fair a grace;  
And knowest thou why? for thou wast wont to chase  
At love in scorn, and for despite him call  
‘Saint Idiot, lord of these fools all.’

131

How often didst thou make thy nice jests,  
And say, that lovers’ servants every one  
Of niceness are verily gods’ apes;  
And some would munch their meat alone,  
Lying abed, and make them for to groan;  
And some, thou saidst, had a blanching fever,  
And prayed God he should never recover!

132

And some of them took on them, for the cold,  
More than enough, so saidst thou full oft;  
And some have feigned oft times, and told  
How that they wake, when they sleep so soft;  
And thus they would have brought themselves aloft,  
And nevertheless were under at the last;  
Thus saidst thou, and jestedst full fast.

133

Yet saidst thou, that, for the more part,  
These lovers would speak in general,  
And thought that it was a sure art  
For failing, to essay everywhere.  
Now may I jest of thee, if that I shall;  
But nevertheless, though that I should die,  
That thou art none of those, that dare I say.

134

Now beat thy breast, and say to God of love,  
‘Thy grace, Lord! for now I me repent  
If I mis-spake, for now myself I love’:  
Thus say with all thine heart in good intent.”

Quoth Troilus, “Ah, Lord! I me consent,  
And pray to thee my japes thou forgive,  
And I shall never more while I live.”

135

“Thou sayst well,” quoth Pandare, “and now I hope  
That thou the gods’ wrath hast all appeased;  
And since thou hast wept many a drop,  
And said such things wherewith thy god is pleased,  
Now would never God but thou were eased;  
And think well, she of whom riseth all thy woe  
Hereafter may thy comfort be also.

136

For that same ground that beareth the useless weed,  
Bears also wholesome herbs, and quite as oft;  
And where the rough and stinging nettles breed,  
Waxes the rose, so sweet and smooth and soft;  
And next the valley lifts the hill aloft,  
And after night, then comes the glad tomorrow,  
And so is joy the after end of sorrow.

137

“But hold with nicely tempered hand thy bridle,  
And think that all things have their proper tide,  
Or else thy labor is but vain and idle;  
He hasteth well that wisely can abide;  
Be diligent, and true, and aye keep hidden.  
Be lusty, free, persevere in thy service,  
And all is well, if thou work in this wise.

138

“A man divided in every place  
Is nowhere whole, as write wise clerks;  
What wonder is, though such one have no grace?  
Knowest thou how it fareth of some service?  
As plant a tree or herb, in sundry wise,  
And on the morrow pull it up alive,  
No wonder is, though it may never thrive.

139

“And since the God of Love hath thee bestowed  
In place worthy unto thy worthiness,  
Stand fast, for to a good port hast thou rowed;  
And of thyself, for any heaviness,  
Hope always well; for, but if dreariness  
Or over-haste our both labour shend,  
I hope of this to make a good end.

140

“And knowest thou why I am the less afeard  
Of this matter with my niece to treat?  
For this have I heard said of wise and learned,  
‘Was never man nor woman yet begotten  
That was unapt to suffer loves’ heat  
Celestial, or else love of kinde;’  
For-thy some grace I hope in her to find.

141

“And for to speak of her in special,  
Her beauty to bethink on and her youth,  
It sitteth her not to be celestial  
As yet, though that her list both and couth;  
But truly, it setteh her well right nought  
A worthy knight to love and cherish.  
And but she do, I hold it for a vice.

142

Wherefore I am, and will be, aye ready  
To peine me to do you this service;  
For both you to please thus hope I  
Hereafterward; for ye be both wise,  
And can it counsel keep in such a wise  
That no man shall the wiser of it be;  
And so we may be gladdened all three.

143

And, by my troth, I have right now of thee  
A good conceit in my wit, as I guess,  
And what it is, I will now that thou see.  
I think, since that love, of his goodness,  
Hath thee converted out of wickedness,  
That thou shalt be the best post, I believe,  
Of all his lay, and most his foes to grieve.

144

Example why, see now these wise clerks,  
That erren almost against a law,  
And be converted from their wicked works  
Through grace of God, that list them to him draw.  
Then am they folk that have most God in awe,  
And grow into his most believing band.  
For they know best all error to withstand.

145

To all this preaching Troilus assented,  
Accepting likewise Pandar’s proffered aid;  
Then waned the woes by which he’d been tormented;  
But hotter waxed his love; and then he made  
Reply, with joyful heart, but manner stayed,  
“Now, blisful Venus, let me never die,  
Till all thy words, O Pandar, fructify!

146

“But friend, how shall my pain grow less acute  
Till this be done? and also tell me first,  
What thou wilt say of me and of my suit,  
For I can look for nothing but the worst,  
And all my hopes will like a bubble burst,  
Since coming from her uncle, much I fear  
That she to nothing of the sort will hear.”

147

“Now, then,” said Pandar, “what the need to worry  
For fear the man might fall from out the moon!  
Good Lord, why all this foolish fuss and hurry?  
Your time will come, not right away, but soon.  
I beg, for God’s sake, grant me this one boon —  
Let me alone! I know what’s best to do!”

148

“All right,” he said, “I leave it all to you.  
But listen, Pandar, one word ere you go!  
Don’t think that towards my lady I desire  
The slightest impropriety to show,  
Or to her harm in any way conspire;  
For I would rather bear my sorrows dire  
Than have her think it was not understood,  
That all I mean is meant for her own good.”

149

“And I your backer,” Pandar laughed, “O fie!  
No need to tell me this, for all say so!  
I only wish that she were standing nigh  
And hearing all you say. But I must go.  
Adieu, be glad and see how things will grow!  
In this affair, I’ll take the strain and stress,  
And yours be all the joy of my success.”

150

Then Troilus began to swell and boast,  
A friendly arm o’er Pandar’s shoulders cast;  
“A fig,” he cried, “for all the Grecian host,  
For God will help us Trojans to the last!  
And here I swear, that ere my days are past,  
Many a Greek through me shall suffer sore —  
But such like boasting henceforth I deplore!

151

“Now, Pandar, more than this I cannot say —  
Be thou my guide, my confidant, my all,  
My life and death both in thy hands I lay!  
Help now!” “Yes, not in vain on me you call.”  
“May God reward you, let what may befall,  
For all my fate on you doth now depend,  
To make me live or meet my fatal end.”

152

But Pandar, eager now his friend to serve,  
To him in few and hasty words replied:

> And strengest-feythed been, I understonde,  
> And conne an errour alder-best withstonde.”

145

When Troilus had heard Pandare assented  
To be his help in loving of Criseyde,  
Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,  
But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde  
With sober cheer, although his heart played,  
“Now blissful Venus help, er that I sterve,  
Of thee, Pandare, I may some thank deserve.

146

But, dere friend, how shall my woe be less  
Till this be done? and good, eke tell me this.  
How wilt thou say of me and my distress?  
Lest she be wroth, this dread I most, ywis.  
Or will not hear or believe how it is.  
All this I dread, and eke for the manere  
Of thee, her uncle, she will no such thing hear.”

147

Quod Pandarus, “thou hast a full great care  
Lest that the churl may fall out of the moon!  
Why, Lord! I hate of thee thy nice fare!  
Why, entremete of that thou hast to do!  
For God’s love, I bid thee a boon.  
So let me alone, and it shall be thy best.”

148

“But hark, Pandare, one word, for I would not  
That thou in me wendest so great folly,  
That to my lady I should desire  
That toucheth harm or any vileness;  
For dreadles, me were lever die  
Than she of me ought elsewise understond  
But that, that might soun into good.”

149

Then laughed Pandare, and anon answered,  
“And I thy borrow? fie! no wight dooth but so;  
I rout not though that she stood and heard  
How that thou sayst; but fare-well, I will go.  
Adieu! be glad! God speed us both two!  
Give me this labour and this business,  
And of my speed be thine all that sweetness.”

150

Then Troilus gan down on knees to fall,  
And Pandare in his arms hent fast,  
And said, “now, fie on the Grekes all!  
Yet, pardee, God shall help us at the last;  
And dreadles, if that my life may last,  
And God to-fore, lo, some of them shall smart;  
And yet me thinketh that this vaunt me astart.”

151

“Now, Pandare, I can no more say.  
But thou knowst, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art all!  
My life, my death, whole in thine hand I lay;  
Help now,” quod he. “Yis, by my troth, I shall.”  
“God yield thee, friend, and this in special,”  
Quod Troilus, “that thou me recommend  
To her that to the death me may command.”

152

This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve  
His full friend, than said in this manner,  
“Farewell, and think I will thy thanks deserve;  
Have here my troth, and that thou shalt well hear.” —  
And went his way, thinking on this matter,  
And how he best might her beseech of grace,  
And find a time thereto, and a place.

153

For every wight that hath an house to founde  
Ne runneth not the work for to beginne  
With reckless hand, but he will bide a stounde,  
And send his heart’s line out from withinne  
Ere first his purpose for to winne.  
All this Pandare in his herte thought,  
And cast his work full wisely, ere he wrought.

154

But Troilus lay tho no lenger down,  
But up anoon upon his steed bay,  
And in the field he played tho lion;  
Woe was that Greek that with him met that day.  
And in the town his manner tho forth ay  
So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,  
That each him loved that looked on his face.

155

For he became the friendliest wight,  
The gentlest, and eke the most free,  
The thriftiest and one the best knight,  
That in his time was, or might be.  
Dead were his japes and his cruelty,  
His high port and his manner strange,  
And each of those began for a virtue change.

156

Now let us stint of Troilus a stounde,  
That fares like a man that hurt is sore,  
And is some deale aching of his wounde  
Y-lissed well, but healed no deal more;  
And, as an easy patient, the lore  
Abide of him that goeth about his cure;  
And thus he driveth forth his aventure.

HERE ENDETH THE FIRST BOOK

## BOOK II

HERE BEGINNETH THE PROEM TO THE SECOND BOOK

Out of these blake wawes for to sayle,  
O wind, O wind, the weder ginneth clere;  
For in this see the boot hath swich travayle.  
Of my conning that unnethe I it stere:  
This see clepe I the tempestous matere  
Of desespeyr that Troilus was inne:  
But now of hope the calendes biginne.

2

O lady myn, that called art Cleo,  
Thou be my speed fro this forth, and my muse,  
To ryme wel this book, til I have do;  
Me nedeth here noon other art to use.  
For-why to every lovere I me excuse,

> If pure inventions I do not endite,  
> But only Latin into English write.

3

Then give me neither thank nor give me blame  
For all this work, for meekly I deny  
The fault, if anywhere my tale be lame,  
For what my author sayeth, so say I.  
And if unskilled in love my pen I ply,  
No wonder that, for who would dare assert  
A blind man should in colors be expert?

4

Remember in the forms of speech comes change  
Within a thousand years, and words that then  
Were well esteemed, seem foolish now and strange;  
And yet they spake them so, time and again,  
And thrived in love as well as any men;  
And so to win their loves in sundry days,  
In sundry lands there are as many ways.

5

If then the situation should arise,  
That any captious lover in this place,  
Who hears this tale, or reads it with his eyes,  
How Troilus sued for his lady’s grace,  
Should think “I’d do not so in such a case,”  
Or wonder at his words or at his acts,  
He may — for me, I merely state the facts.

6

Travellers to Rome, as on their way they wend,  
Hold not one path and not the self-same style;  
And in some lands the game would quickly end,  
If men made love as we do all the while,  
As thus — so openly with glance or smile,  
And visits, forms, and pretty speeches, too;  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

7

> I doubt if in this land you could find three  
> Who’d act the same, if they in love should fall;  
>  
> For what I like, to you may hateful be,  
>  
> And yet we reach the same end, one and all,  
>  
> Though some may carve on trees, some on a wall,  
>  
> As it may chance. — But now where I began,  
>  
> My story I must hasten as I can.
> 
> That of no sentement I this endyte,  
> 
> But out of Latin in my tonge it wryte.

3

Wherfore I nil have neither thank ne blame  
Of al this werk, but pray yow mekely,  
Disblameth me, if any word be lame.  
For as myn auctor seyde, so seye I.  
Eek though I speke of love unfclingly.  
No wonder is, for it no-thing of newe is;  
A blind man can nat juggen wel in hewis.

4

Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge  
With-inne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho  
That hadden prys, now wonder nyce and straunge  
Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so.  
And spedde as wel in love as men now do;  
Eek for to winne love in sondry ages.  
In sondry londes, sondry been usages.

5

And for-thy if it happe in any wyse  
That here be any lovere in this place  
That herkeneth, as the story wol devyse,  
How Troilus com to his lady grace,  
And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace.  
Or wondreth on his speche and his doinge,  
I noot; but it is me no wonderinge;

6

For every wight which that to Rome went  
Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere;  
Eek in som lend were al the gamen shent.  
If that they ferde in love as men don here,  
As thus, in open doing or in chere,  
In visitinge, in forme, or seyde hir sawes;  
For-thy men seyn, ech contree hath his lawes.

7

Eek scarsly been ther in this place three  
That han in love seyd lyk and doon in al;  
For to thy purpos this may lyken thee.  
And thee right nought, yet al is seyd or shal;  
Eek som men grave in tree, som in stoon wal.  
As it bitit; but sin I have begonne,  
Myn auctor shal I folwen, if I conne.

In May, mother of months, when all is gay,  
When flowers, blue and white and red, now grow  
Again, as winter’s deadly hold gives way,  
When balmy breezes o’er the meadows blow  
And Phoebus with his brightest beams doth glow  
In the white Bull, and of this month the third,  
I now shall sing what great events occurred.

9

Wise Pandar then, for all his helpful speech,  
Now felt, himself, the barb of love so keen,  
That though he ne’er so well could others teach,  
For thwarted love he turned a sickly green;  
And all for nothing but this lover’s spleen.  
To bed he straightway went, and no time lost,  
Where all the weary night he turned and tossed.

# THE SECOND BOOK

In May, that moder is of monthes glade,  
That fresshe floures, blewe, and whyte, and rede,  
Ben quike agayn, that winter dede made.  
And ful of bawme is fletinge every mede;  
Whan Phebus doth his brighte bemes sprede  
Right in the whyte Bole, it so bitidde  
As I shal singe, on Mayes day the thridde,

That Pandarus, for al his wyse speche,  
Felte eek his part of loves shottes kene,  
That, coude he never so wel of loving preche.  
It made his hewe a-day ful ofte grene;  
So shoop it, that him fil that day a tene  
In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,  
And made, er it was day, ful many a wente.

10

The swalwe Progne, with a sorwful lay,  
Whan morwe com, gan make hir weymentinge,  
Why she forshapen was; and ever lay  
Pandare a-bedde, half in a slomeringe,  
Til she so neigh him made hir chiteringe  
How Tereus gan forth hir suster take,  
That with the noyse of hir he gan a-wake;

11

And gan to calle, and dresse him up to ryse,  
Remembringe him his erand was to done  
From Troilus, and eek his greet empryse;  
And caste and knew in good plyt was the mone  
To doon viage, and took his wey ful sone  
Un-to his neces paleys ther bi-syde;  
Now Janus, god of entree, thou him gyde!

12

Whan he was come un-to his neces place,  
“Wher is my lady?” to hir folk seyde he;  
And they him tolde; and he forth in gan pace.  
And fond, two othere ladyes sete and she  
With-inne a paved parlour; and they three  
Herden a mayden reden hem the geste  
Of the Sege of Thebes, whyl hem leste.

13

Quod Pandarus, “ma dame, god yow see  
With al your book and al the companye!”  
“Ey, uncle myn, welcome y-wis,” quod she.  
And up she roos, and by the hond in hye  
She took him faste, and seyde, “this night thrye  
To goode mote it turne, of yow I mette!”  
And with that word she doun on bench him sette.

14

“Ye, nece, ye shal fare wel the bet,  
If god wole, al this yeer,” quod Pandarus;  
“But I am sory that I have yow let  
To herknen of your book ye preysen thus;  
For goddes love, what seith it? tel it us.  
Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!”  
“Uncle,” quod she, “your maistresse is not here!”

15

With that they gonnen laughe, and tho she seyde,  
“This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede;  
And we han herd how that king Laius deyde  
Thurgh Edippus his sone, and al that dede;  
And here we stenten at these lettres rede,  
How the bisshop, as the book can telle,  
Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.”

Quod Pandarus, “al this knowe I my selve,  
And al the’assege of Thebes and the care;  
For her-of been ther maked bokes twelve: —  
But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare;  
Do wey your barbe, and shew your face bare;  
Do wey your book, rys up, and lat us daunce.  
And lat us don to May som observaunce.”

17

“A! god forbede!” quod she, “be ye mad?  
Is that a widewes lyf, so god you save?  
By god, ye maken me right sore a-drad,  
Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave!  
It sete me wel bet ay in a cave  
To bidde, and rede on holy seyntes lyves:  
Lat maydens gon to daunce, and yonge wyves.”

18

“As ever thryve I,” quod this Pandarus,  
“Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleye.*”  
“Now uncle dere,” quod she, “tel it us  
For goddes love; is than th’assege aweye?  
I am of Grekes so ferd that I deye.”  
“Nay, nay,” quod he, “as ever mote I thryve!  
It is a thing wel bet than swiche fyve.”

19

“Ye, holy god!” quod she, “what thing is that?  
What? bet than swiche fyve? ey, nay, y-wis!  
For al this world ne can I reden what  
It sholde been; som jape, I trowe, is this;  
And bur your-selven telle us what it is,  
My wit is for to arede it al to lene;  
As help me god, I noot nat what ye mene.”

20

“And I your borow, ne never shal, for me.  
This thing be told to yow, as mote I thryve!”  
“And why so, uncle myn? why so?” quod she.  
“By god,” quod he, “that wole I telle as blyve;  
For prouder womman were their noon on-lyve.  
And ye it wiste, in al the toun of Troye;  
I jape nought, as ever have I joye!”

21

Tho gan she wondren more than biforn  
A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste;  
For never, sith the tyme that she was born,  
To knowe thing desired she so faste;  
And with a syk she seyde him at the laste,  
“Now, uncle myn, I nil yow nought displese.  
Nor axen more, that may do yow disese.”

22

So after this, with many wordes glade  
And freendly tales, and with mery chere,  
Of this and that they pleyde, and gunnen wade  
In many an unkouth glad and deep matere.  
As freendes doon, whan they ben met y-fere;  
Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde,  
That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde.

23

“Ful wel, I thanke it god,” quod Pandarus,  
“Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde;  
And eek his fresshe brother Troilus,  
The wyse worthy Ector the secounde,  
In whom that every vertu list abounde,  
As alie trouthe and alle gentillesse,  
Wysdom, honour, fredom, and worthinesse.”

24

“In good feith, eem,” quod she, “that lyketh me;  
They faren wel, god save hem bothe two!  
For trewely I holde it greet deyntee  
A kinges sone in armes wel to do,  
And been of good condiciouns ther-to;  
For greet power and moral vertu here  
Is selde y-seye in o persone y-fere.”

25

“In good feith, that is sooth,” quod Pandarus;  
“But, by my trouthe, the king hath sones tweye.  
That is to mene, Ector and Troilus,  
That certainly, though that I sholde deye.  
They been as voyde of vyces, dar I seye.  
As any men that liveth under the sonne,  
Hir might is wyde y-knowe, and what they conne.

26

Of Ector nedeth it nought for to telle;  
In al this world ther nis a bettre knight  
Than he, that is of worthinesse welle;  
And he wel more vertu hath than might.  
This knoweth many a wys and worthy wight.  
The same prys of Troilus I seye,  
God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweye.”

27

“By god,” quod she, “of Ector that is sooth;  
Of Troilus the same thing trowe I;  
For dredelees, men tellen that he dooth  
In armes day by day so worthily.  
And bereth him here at hoom so gentilly  
To every wight, that al the prys hath he  
Of hem that me were levest preysed be.”

28

“Ye sey right sooth, y-wis,” quod Pandarus;  
“For yesterday, who-so hadde with him been,  
He might have wondred up-on Troilus;  
For never yet so thikke a swarm of been  
Ne fleigh, as Grekes fro him gonne fleen;  
And thorugh the feld, in every wightes ere,  
Ther nas no cry but ‘Troilus is there!’”

29

Now here, now there, he hunted hem so faste,  
Ther nas but Grekes blood; and Troilus,  
Now hem he hurte, and hem alle doun he caste;  
Ay where he wente it was arayed thus:  
He was hir deeth, and sheld and lyf for us;  
That as that day ther dorste noon withstonde,  
Whyl that he held his blody swerd in honde.

30

Therto he is the freendlieste man  
Of grete estat, that ever I saw my lyve;  
And wher him list, best felawshipe can  
To suche as him thinketh able for to thryve.”  
And with that word tho Pandarus, as blyve,  
He took his leve, and seyde, “I wol go henne”:  
“Nay, blame have I, myn uncle,” quod she thenne.

31

“What eyleth yow to be thus wery sone,  
And namelich of wommen? wol ye so?  
Nay, sitteth down; by god, I have to done  
With yow, to speke of wisdom er ye go.”  
And every wight that was a-boute hem tho  
That herde that, gan fer a-wey to stonde,  
Whyl they two hadde al that hem liste in honde.

32

Whan that hir tale al brought was to an ende  
Of hire estat and of hir governaunce.  
Quod Pandarus, “now is it tyme I wende;  
But yet, I seye, aryseth, lat us daunce.  
And cast your widwes habit to mischaunce:  
What list yow thus your-self to disfigure,  
Sith yow is tid thus fair an aventure?”

33

“A! wel bithought! for love of god,” quod she.  
That you might safely venture to compare,  
So void of vice and full of virtues fair,  
With any men that live beneath the sun,  
So famous, too, for all that they have done.

34

“For niece, by great Minerva, the divine,  
And Jupiter, who makes the thunder ringe,  
And Venus, goddess most especially mine,  
No other person on this world so rynge —  
Sweethearts excepted — have I ever found,  
That I love more than thee and least would grieve,  
And this I think you know and well believe.”

35

“O surely, uncle,” quod she, “grant mercy;  
Your freendship have I founden ever yit;  
I am to no man holden trewely  
So muche as yow, and have so litel quit;  
And, with the grace of god, emforth my wit.  
As in my gilt I shal you never offende;  
And if I have er this, I wol amende.

36

“But, for the love of god, I yow beseche,  
As ye ben he that I most love and triste,  
Lat be to me your fremde maner speche,  
And sey to me, your nece, what yow liste”:  
And with that word hir uncle anoon hir kiste,  
And seyde, “gladly, leve nece dere,  
Tak it for good that I shal seye yow here.”

37

With that she gan hir eyen doun to caste,  
And Pandarus to coghe gan a lyte.  
And seyde, “nece, alwey, lo! to the last,  
How-so it be that som men hem delyte  
With subtil art hir tales for to endyte.  
Yet for al that, in hir entencioun,  
Hir tale is al for some conclusioun.

38

“And sithen th’ende is every tales strengthe.  
And this matere is so bihovely,  
What sholde I peynte or drawen it on lengthe  
To yow, that been my freend so feithfully?”  
And with that word he gan right inwardly  
Biholden hir, and loken on hir face,  
And seyde, “on suche a mirour goode grace!”

39

Than thoughte he thus, “if I my tale endyte  
Ought hard, or make a proces any whyle,  
She shal no savour han ther-in but lyte,  
And trowe I wolde hir in my wil bigyle.  
For tendre wittes wenen al be wyle  
Ther-as they can nat pleynly understonde;  
For-thy hir wit to serven wol I fonde” —

40

And loked on hir in a besy wyse,  
And she was war that he byheld hir so,  
And seyde, “lord! so faste ye me avyse!  
Sey ye me never er now? what sey ye, no?”  
“Yes, yes”, quod he, “and bet wole er I go;  
But, by my trouthe, I thoughte now if ye  
Be fortunat, for now men shal it see.

41

For to every wight som goodly aventure  
Som tyme is shape, if he it can receyven;  
And if that he wol take of it no cure,  
Whan that it cometh, but wilfully it weyven,  
Lo, neither cas nor fortune him deceyven,  
But right his verray slouthe and wrecchednesse;  
And swich a wright is for to blame, I gesse.

42

Good aventure, O bele nece, have ye  
Ful lightly founden, and ye conne it take;  
And, for the love of god, and eek of me,  
Cacche it anoon, lest aventure slake.  
What sholde I lenger proces of it make?  
Yif me your hond, for in this world is noon  
If that you list, a wight so wel begoon.

43

And sith I speke of good entencioun  
As I to yow have told wel here-bifom,  
And love as wel your honour and renoun  
As creature in al this world y-born;  
By alle the othes that I have yow sworn,  
And ye be wrooth therfore, or wene I lye,  
Ne shal I never seen yow eft with ye.

44

Beth nought agast, ne quaketh nat; wher-to?  
Ne chaungeth nat for fere so your hewe;  
For hardely, the werste of this is do;  
And though my tale as now be to yow newe.  
Yet trist alwey, ye shal me finde trewe;  
And were it thing that me thoughte unsittinge,  
To yow nolde I no swiche tales bringe.”

45

“Now, my good eem, for goddes love, I preye,”  
Quod she, “com of, and tel me what it is;  
For bothe I am agast what ye wol seye,  
And eek me longeth it to wite, y-wis  
For whether it be wel or be amis,  
Sey on, lat me not in this fere dwelled.”

46

“So wol I doon, now herkneth, I shal telle:  
Now, nece myn, the kinges dere sone,  
The goode, wyse, worthy, fresshe, and free,  
Which alwey for to do wel is his wone,  
The noble Troilus, so loveth thee.  
That, bot ye helpe, it wol his bane be.  
Lo, here is al, what sholde I more seye?  
Doth what yow list to make him live or deye.

47

But if ye lete him deye, I wol sterve;  
Have her my trouthe, nece, I nil not lyen;  
Al sholde I with this knyf my throte kerve —”  
With that the teres braste out of his yen,  
And seyde, “if that ye doon us bothe dyen,  
Thus giltelees, than have ye fisshed faire;  
What mende ye, though that we bothe apeyre?

48

Allas! he which that is my lord so dere,  
That trewe man, that noble gentil knight,  
That nought desireth but your freendly chere,  
I see him deye, ther he goth up-right,  
And hasteth him, with al his fulle might,  

49

To maken alle thinges weel and everichon.  
So fel hem falle, that for his noble dede  
Men sholde him now for alle peyne calle;  
But for your sake, my nece, that shal be drede,  
Yit wol I for the love of thee be dede.  
And thus I seye, take hede, and lat me pleye."

# TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

## BOOK II

### 88
> And she was somewhat troubled at the thought  
> Of all she’d heard and done; but still when she  
> Had weighed it well, it seemed that there was naught  
> To justify so great timidity;  
>  
> For though a man with love near bursting be,  
> Nothing compels a woman to respond—  
> Unless, indeed, she should of him grow fond.

### 89
> And as she sat alone, reflecting thus,  
> The noise arose of skirmishers without,  
> And men cried in the street, “Lo, Troilus  
> Hath put the coward Greeks to flight and rout!”  
> And all her household ran up with a shout,  
> “O let us see! Throw up the lattice wide!  
> As he goes home, he through this street will ride!”

### 90
> “There is no other way here from the gates  
> Of Dardanus where they’ve let down the chain.”  
> And then he came, with all his battle-mates,  
> All riding slowly in a double train;  
> And that it was his lucky day ’twas plain,  
> A day on which things turn out as they should,  
> And even bad luck turns at last to good.

### 91
> Troilus rode upon his good bay steed,  
> All armed, except his head, in richest gear;  
> The wounds upon his charger still did bleed,  
> As slowly down the street the band drew near.  
> O what a noble sight did then appear!  
> Like Mars himself for battle all arrayed,  
> Troilus led the warlike cavalcade.

### 92
> He was the picture of a warrior knight,  
> A man of greatest prowess in all ways,  
> For bold in mind, he strove with equal might  
> In deeds that won a universal praise.  
> It was pure joy upon this knight to gaze;  
> So fresh, so young, with such vitality,  
> He was, in truth, a heavenly sight to see.

### 93
> His helm was hacked in twenty different places,  
> So that it hung by just a slender thread;  
> His shield was cut by strokes of swords and maces,  
> With arrows buried in it to the head,  
> Where horn and sinew made for them a bed.  
> And loud the people cried, “Here comes our joy,  
> And with his brother, great defence of Troy!”

### 94
> And Troilus a little blushed for shame,  
> When thus he heard the people shout and cry;  
> To watch him was as good as any game,  
> How soberly he downward cast his eye;  
> And Cressida, intent on all to spy,  
> Felt in her heart a softly sinking motion,  
> And sighed, “Has some one given me a potion?”

### 95
> And at this thought she blushed a rosy red,  
> Bethinking her, “This is the very he  
> Who loves me so, so hath my uncle said,  
> That he will die, unless help comes from me!”  
> And then in modest fear that he might see,  
> She drew back from the casement window fast  
> As Troilus and all his people passed.

### 96
> And then in mind she canvassed up and down  
> The count of all his gracious qualities,  
> And all his rank and all his great renown,  
> His wit, his figure, all his knightly ease.  
> But that he loved her, most of all did please;  
> And then she said, “This man to death to do,  
> ’Twere pity, if his mind and heart are true.”

### 97
> Now envious folk might make objection thus:  
> “This was a sudden love! How might it be  
> That she so quickly should love Troilus  
> At sight?” Why, such things happen frequently,  
> And if you doubt, just look about and see!  
> For all things slight beginnings first must know  
> Before to full completion they can grow.

### 98
> For mark, not in the twinkling of an eye  
> She gave her love to him, but did incline  
> To like him first, and I have told you why;  
> And afterward, his qualities so fine  
> Made deepest love within her heart to mine,  
> And only then, for proper service done,  
> And not by sudden glance, her love was won.

### 99
> Recall also that Venus, well arrayed,  
> Within her seventh house just then doth go,  
> With all kind aspects at that time displayed  
> To help poor Troilus in his deep woe;  
> And she was not in any case a foe  
> To Troilus from his first natal hour,  
> Whereby in love he had the greater power.

### 100
> Let Troilus in peace his ways now go,  
> And let us turn to Cressida, shamefast  
> And pensive, sitting with her head bent low  
> And trying solitary to forecast  
> What courses she should follow at the last,  
> If Pandar persevering for his friend  
> Should push this suit unto the final end.

### 101
> Then in her heart she started to debate  
> Of this affair, as I have to you told,  
> And over this and that to hesitate  
> She had twisted it in many a fold;  
> And now her heart was warm, now was it cold,  
> And some of what she thought I shall relate—  
> Though far too long were all of her debate.

### 102
> And first she thought that Troilus she knew  
> At least by sight, and all about his birth,  
> So high she said, “Of course it would not do  
> To think of love with one of such high worth,  
> But still ’twould be an honor, but in mirth  
> And in all innocence, for me to deal  
> With one like him, and mayhap for his weal.

### 103
> “I don’t forget he is my sovereign’s son,  
> And since he seems in me to take delight,  
> If I all his advances harshly shun,  
> Perchance he might have me in despite,  
> Through which I might stand in worse plight;  
> Now were I wise, me hate to purchase,  
> Withouten need, where I may stand in grace?

### 104
> In every thing, I wot, there lieth measure.  
> For though a man forbid drunkenness,  
> He nought forbid that every creature  
> Be drinkless for alway, as I gess;  
> E’en since I wot for me is his distress,  
> I ne ought not for that thing him despise,  
> Sith it is so, he meaneth in good wise.

### 105
> And e’en I know, of long time ago,  
> His manners good, and that he is not nice.  
> Nor vaunter, say the folk, certainly is he none;  
> Too wise is he to do so great a vice;  
> Nor—though I never so cherish him—  
> That he may make vaunt by any just cause;  
> He shall me never bind in such a clause.

### 106
> Now set a case, the hardest is, ywis:  
> Men might deem that he loveth me:  
> What dishonor were it unto me, this?  
> May I him let of that? Why nay, pardee!  
> I know also, and alway hear and see,  
> Men love women all this town about;  
> Be they the worse? Why, nay, without a doubt.

### 107
> I think e’en how he able is to have  
> Of all this noble town the thriftiest,  
> To been his love, so she her honour save;  
> For out and out he is the worthiest.  
> Save only Hector, which that is the best,  
> And yet his life al lieth now in my cure,  
> But such is love, and eke my adventure.

### 108
> Nor me to love, a wonder is it naught;  
> For well I wot myself, so God me speed,  
> Although I would that none had known this thought,  
> I am one the fairest, out of drede,  
> And goodliest, who-so taketh hede;  
> And so men say in all the town of Troy.  
> What wonder is it though he of me have joy?

### 109
> I am mine own woman, well at ease,  
> I thank God, as after my estate;  
> Right young, and stand unteyd in lusty lease,  
> Without jealousy or such debate;  
> Shall no husband say to me “Checkmate!”  
> For either they be full of jealousy,  
> Or masterful, or love novelrye.

### 110
> What shall I do? To what fine live I thus?  
> Shall I not love, in case that it me leste?  
> What, par Dieu! I am nought religious!  
> And though that I my heart set at rest  
> Upon this knight, that is the worthiest,  
> And keep always my honour and my name,  
> By all right, it may do me no shame.

### 111
> Now like the sun in March which shines out bright,  
> Though oft the March sun, too, doth hide his face;  
> Though the winds may put the clouds to flight,  
> Their courses soon again the clouds retrace;  
> So now a cloudy thought began to race  
> Across her heart, o’erspreading like a pall  
> Her sunny thoughts with shadowy thought withal.

### 112
> The thought was this, “Alas, since I am free,  
> Should I now love and risk my happy state,  
> And maybe put in bonds my liberty?  
> What folly such a course to contemplate!  
> Am I not satisfied to see the fate  
> Of others, with their fear and joy and pain?  
> Who loveth not, no cause hath to complain.

### 113
> “For lovers ever lead a stormy life,  
> And have done so since loving was begun;  
> For always some distrust and foolish strife  
> There is in love, some cloud across the sun.  
> Then nothing by us women can be done,  
> But weep in wretchedness and sit and think,  
> ‘This is our lot, the cup of woe to drink!’
>  
> “And slanderous tongues, they are so very quick  
> To do us harm, and men are so untrue,  
> And once they’re satisfied, they soon grow sick  
> Of ancient love and look for something new!  
> But when all’s done, then what can women do!  
> These men at first their love like mad will spend,  
> But sharp attacks oft weaken at the end.

### 114
> “Full often it hath been exemplified,  
> The treason that to women men will show;  
> And that’s the end, when such a love hath died,  
> For what becomes of it, when it doth go,  
> No living creature on this earth can know.  
> For then there’s nothing left to love or spurn;  
> What once was naught, to nothing doth return.

### 115
> “And if I love, how busy must I be  
> To guard against all idle people’s chatter,  
> And fool them that they see no fault in me,  
> For true or not, to them it doesn’t matter,  
> If but their lying tales amuse or flatter;  
> For who can stop the wagging of a tongue,  
> Or sound of bells the while that they are rung?”

### 116
> But when her cloudy thoughts began to clear,  
> She countered, “Nothing venture, nothing gain!  
> All things must have their price, or cheap or dear.”  
> This thought brought dark forebodings in its train,  
> And hope and fear were linked in endless chain;  
> Now hot, now cold, and thus between the two  
> She started up, still doubtful what to do.

### 117
> Downstairs along the garden paths she went,  
> And calling to her there her nieces three,  
> She rambled through the garden’s whole extent—  
> Flexippe, Tharbe and Antigone—  
> A charming and a pleasant sight to see;  
> And others of her women came along,  
> And in the garden made a merry throng.

### 118
> This yard was large, and railed all the alleys,  
> And shaded well with blossoms’ boughs all green;  
> And benched anew and sanded were the ways  
> In which she walketh arm in arm between;  
> Till at the last Antigone the shene  
> Began a Trojan song to sing so clear,  
> That it was heaven her voice to hear.

### 119
> She sang, “O Love, to whom I have and shall  
> Be humble subject, true in my intent,  
> As I best can to thee, lord, give I all  
> For evermore, my heart’s delight to rent.

> To tell, and you can guess them anyway.

### 132
> Upon a cedar green a nightingale,  
> Under the chamber wall near where she lay,  
> Full loudly sang against the moonlight pale,  
> A song perhaps of love, as birds well may;  
> For love alone could make a song so gay;

### 133
> And as she slept, she dreamed, and dreaming saw

> Now let her sleep, and we our tales hold  
> Of Troilus, that is to palace ridden,  
> From the skirmish of which I lately told,  
> And in his chamber sits, and hath abided  
> Till two or three of his messages had tridden  
> For Pandarus, and sought him ful fast,

> She shall not pull it out this next week;  
> God send more such thorns on to pick!  
>  
> (183)  
>  
> And Pandar, who stood her fast beside,  
> Felt iron hot, and he began to strike,  
> And said, “Niece, I pray you heartily,  
> Tell me that I shall ask you a little.  
> A woman who were of his death to blame,  
> Without his guilt, but for her lacked ruth,  
> Were it well done?” Quoth she, “Nay, by my troth!”

> (184)  
>  
> “God help me so,” quoth he, “ye say me sooth.  
> Ye feel well your self that I not lie;

> “Well,” quoth Pandare, “as I have told you thrice;

> But Pandarus thought, “It shall not be so.

# BOOK II

Of all requests this was as needless one  
As bid a wild man leap and jump and run.

223

Reckoning next day where she was to dine,  
Helen the queen, the famous and the fair,  
Informally and some time after nine,  
Doth to her kindly brother’s house repair,  
Just to a little family dinner there,  
And took it as a usual event,  
Though God and Pandar knew what it all meant.

224

Criseyde, unsuspecting, brought along  
Antigone and Tarbe, sisters two —  
In fact the diners numbered quite a throng;  
But I don’t mean to pass here in review  
The names of guests and all they say and do,  
For you can guess their greetings and their chatter,  
And we’ll proceed to more important matter.

> For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye.  
> Sone after that, doun in thy bed he leye,  
> And sey, thou mayst no lenger up endure,  
> And lye right there, and byde thy aventure.  
>
> Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take  
> The same tyme, and lasteth til a-morwe;  
> And let see now how wey thou canst it make.  
> For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe.  
> Go now, farewell and, Venus here to borrow,  
> I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,  
> Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.

218

Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take  
The same tyme, and lasten til a-morwe;  
And lat see now how wey thou canst it make.  
For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe.  
Go now, farewell and, Venus here to borwe,  
I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,  
Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.

219

Quod Troilus, “y-wis, thou nedelees  
Counseylest me, that sykliche I me feyne!  
For I am syk in ernest, doutelees,  
So that wel neigh I sterve for the peyne.”

Quod Pandarus, “thou shalt the bettre pleyn,  
And hast the lasse nede to countrefete;  
For him men demen hoot that men seen swete.

220

Lo, holde thee at thy triste clos, and I  
Shal wel the deer unto thy bowe dryve.”  
Therwith he took his leve al softly.  
And Troilus to paleys wente blyve.  
So glad ne was he never in al his lyve;  
And to Pandarus reed gan al assente.

221

What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere  
That Deiphebus unto his brother made,  
Or his accesse, or his syklich manere,  
How men gan him with clothes for to lade,  
Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade?  
But al for nought, he held forth ay the wyse  
That ye han herd Pandare er this.

But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde,  
Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,  
To been a freend and helping to Criseyde.  
God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right,  
To been hir fulle freend with al his might.  
But swich a nede was to preye him thenne,  
As for to bidde a wood man for to renne.

223

The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme  
Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne  
Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme,  
With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;  
But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne.  
She com to diner in hir playn entente.  
But God and Pandare wiste al what this mente.

224

Come eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,  
Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;  
But flee we now prolixitee best is,  
For love of God, and lat us faste go  
Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo,  
Why al this folk assembled in this place;  
And lat us of hir saluinges pace.

225–232

Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,  
And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke.  
But ever-more, “alas!” was his refreyn,  
“My goode brother Troilus, the syke,  
Lyth yet” — and therwithal he gan to syke;  
And after that, he peyned him to glade  
Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.

226

Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse  
So feithfully, that pitee was to here.  
And every wight gan waxen for accesse  
A leche anoon, and seyde, “in this manere  
Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.”  
But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,  
That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche.

227

After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse.  
As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne  
To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse  
A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne: —  
“He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.”  
And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,  
He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme.

228

Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,  
And every word gan for to notifye;  
For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;  
For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,  
To mowen swich a knight don live or dye?  
But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;  
For for o fyn is al that ever I telle.

229

The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse.  
And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,  
And gonne a whyl of this and that devyse.  
But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,  
And seyde to Deiphebus, “wole ye goon,  
If youre wille be, as I yow preyde,  
To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?”

230

Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,  
Took first the tale, and seyde, “go we blyve”:  
And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,  
And seyde, “Joves lat him never thryve,  
That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve!  
And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe.  
If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.”

231

“Tel thou thy neces cas,” quod Deiphebus  
To Pandarus, “for thou canst best it telle.” —  
“My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus,  
What solde I lenger,” quod he, “do yow dwelle?”  
He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle  
Upon hir fo, that highte Poliphete,  
So heynous, that men mighte on it spete.

232

Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other.  
And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,  
“An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;  
And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.”

225

Deiphebus his guests doth entertain  
With most delicious foods, the very pick,  
But now and then, “Alas,” was his refrain,  
“That Troilus in bed is lying sick!”  
Yet to this theme he did not always stick.  
But often spoke of things more bright and cheery,  
To keep his honored guests from growing weary.

226

And Helen, too, was really very nice  
In warm expression of her sympathy,  
And each one had some medical advice  
To give — “I think the best treatment would be” —  
“This charm indeed I wolde recommend to thee” —  
But to this lore that one made no addition  
Who thought, “’Tis I could be his best physician.”

227

And then his praises they began to sing.  
As folk will do when someone has begun;  
A thousand variations there they ring  
Upon this theme, and praise him to the sun,  
“He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne,” they say;  
And Pandar confirms with zeal the same.

228

Criseyde heard, although she took no part,  
And every word gan for to notifye;  
Though grave her look, she laughing was at heart,  
For who alive would not great comfort find  
To think she could about her finger wind  
A knight like that! But now too long I dwell  
And must proceed the end of this to tell.

229

The time came from the table to arise,  
And thus they stood about, while each one spoke  
By chance of one or other enterprise,  
Till on the conversation Pandar broke  
And said, “Deiphebus, if you will, as I pray,  
Will you speak here of Criseyde’s distress?”

230

And Helen, holding Criseyde’s hand, replied,  
“Go we,” and looked upon Criseyde fair:  
“By Jove, let him not thrive who doth you wrong!  
May they who harm you soon have cause to rue!”  
“If I may help him, and all folk be true.”

231

“Tell thou thy case,” quoth Deiphebus to Pandar,  
“For thou canst best it tell.” Then Pandar said,  
“My lords and ladies, it standeth thus —”  
“What need to longer make you here to dwell?”  
He rang it out, a tale like to a bell,  
Of Poliphete, a wretch so foul and base,  
That all were ready to condemn his case.

232

They all reviled him, each one worse than other:  
“Hanged be that wretch, were he my brother!” —  
“So shall he be; there is no other cure.”

233–240

But why should I at length this tale rehearse?  
For each and all assured her in the end  
They’d do their best and be her staunchest friend.

233

“O Pandar,” quoth Eleyne, “pray tell to us,  
Is my good lord and brother — Hector, I mean —  
Informed of this? And Troilus?”  

He seyde, “ye, but wole ye now me here?  
Methinketh this, sith Troilus is here,  
It were good, if that ye wolde assente,  
She tolde hir-self him al this er she wente.

234

For he wol have the more hir grief at herte.  
By cause, lo, that she a lady is;  
And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,  
And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,  
If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.”  
And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,  
“God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!”

235

To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,  
And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,  
Out wente anoon t’Eleyne and Deiphebus,  
And seyde hem, “so there be no taryinge,  
Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe  
Criseyda, my lady, that is here;  
And as he may enduren, he wole here.

236

But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,  
And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;  
Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,  
To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm  
Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),  
Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones;  
Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is.

237

I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe,  
That no wight in ne wente but ye tweye.  
But it were I, for I can, in a throwe,  
Reherce hir cas, unlyk that she can seye;  
And after this, she may him ones preye  
To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;  
This may not muchel of his ese him reve.

238

And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere  
His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;  
Eek other thing, that toucheth not to here,  
He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now,  
That secret is, and for the tounes prow.”  
And they, that no-thing knewe of this entente,  
With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente.

239

Eleyne in al hir goodly softe wyse,  
Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,  
And seyde, “ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse!  
Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!”  
And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye,  
And him with al hir wit to recomforte;  
As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.

240

So after this quod she, “we yow biseke,  
My brother dear Deiphebus and I,  
For love of — O, and so doth Pandar, too, —  
To be a friend to one whom we hold high,  
To Criseyda, who no one can deny  
Has been much wronged, and Pandar over there,  
Her case and situation can declare.”

241–247

My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I,  
For love of God, and so doth Pandare eke,  
To been good lord and freend, right hertely  
Unto Criseyde, which that certeinly  
Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,  
That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.

241

Then Pandar gan newe his tunge affile,  
And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon;  
Whan it was seyd, sone after, in a whyle,  
Quod Troilus, “as sone as I may goon,  
I wol right fayn with al my might be oon,  
Have God my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.”  
“Good thrift have ye,” quod Eleyne the quene.

242

Quod Pandarus, “and it your wille be,  
That she may take hir leve, er that she go?”  
“Or elles God for-bede,” tho quod he,  
“If that she vouche sauf for to do so.”  
And with that word quod Troilus, “ye two,  
Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere,  
To yow have I to speke of o matere

243

To been avysed by your reed the bettre”: —  
And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed,  
The copie of a tretis and a lettre,  
That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed.  
If swich a man was worthy to ben deed,  
Woot I nought who; but in a grisly wyse  
He preyede hem anoon on it avyse.

244

Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde  
In ernest greet; so dide Eleyne the quene;  
And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,  
Downward a steyre, into an herber grene.  
This ilke thing they redden hem bitwene;  
And largely, the mountaunce of an houre,  
They gonne on it to reden and to poure.

245

Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon  
To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye  
That al was wel, and out he gan to goon  
Into the grete chambre, and that in hye,  
And seyde, “God save al this companye!  
Com, nece myn; my lady quene Eleyne  
Abydeth yow, and eek my lordes tweyne.

246

Rys, take with yow your nece Antigone,  
Or whom yow list, or no fors, hardily;  
The lasse prees, the bet; com forth with me.  
And loke that ye thonke humblely  
Hem alle three, and, whan ye may goodly  
Your tyme y-see, taketh of hem your leve.  
Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.”

247

Al innocent of Pandarus entente,  
Quod tho Criseyde, “go we, uncle dere”;  
And arm in arm inward with him she wente,  
Avysed wel hir wordes and hir chere;  
And Pandarus, in ernestful manere,  
Seyde, “alle folk, for goddes love, I preye,  
Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleye.

248

“But don’t forget what folk are there within  
And one of them, God help him, in what plight!”  
“Dear niece,” he murmured in her ear, “begin  
But gently with this man and do him right,  
And by the Lord who grants us life and light,  
And by the crowning power of virtues twain,  
Let him not lie here in this mortal pain!”

249

“Defy the devil! Think which one he is,  
And in what plight he lieth; come of anoon;  
Think all such taried tide, but lost it nis!  
That wol ye bothe seyn, whan ye ben oon.  
Secondly, ther yet devyneth noon  
Upon yow two; com of now, if ye conne;  
Whyl folk is blent, lo, al the tyme is wonne!

250

In titering, and pursuite, and delayes,  
The folk devyne at wagging of a stree;  
And though ye wolde han after merye dayes,  
Than dar ye nought, and why? for she, and she  
Spak swich a word; thus loked he, and he;  
Lest tyme I loste, I dar not with yow dele;  
Com of therfore, and bringeth him to hele.”

251

But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here,  
Was Troilus nought in a cankedort,  
That lay, and mighte whisperinge of hem here,  
And thoughte, “O lord, right now renneth my sort  
Fully to dye, or han anoon comfort”;  
And was the firste tyme he shulde hir preye  
Of love; O mighty God, what shal he seye?

O happy light, of which the beams so clear  
Illume the third expanse of heaven’s air,  
Loved of the sun, of Jove the daughter dear,  
O Love’s Delight, thou goodly one and fair,  
In gentle hearts abiding everywhere,  
Thou primal cause of joy and all salvation,  
Exalted be thy name through all creation!

2

In heaven and hell, on earth and salty sea,  
All creatures answer to thy might supernal,  
For man, bird, beast, fish, herb and leafy tree,  
Their seasons know from thy breath ever vernal.  
God loves, and grants that love shall be eternal.  
All creatures in the world through love exist,  
And lacking love, lack all that may persist.

3

Mover of Jove to that so happy end,  
Through which all earthly creatures live and be,  
When mortal love upon him thou didst send,  
For as thou wilt, the power lies with thee  
Yeve him in love ese or love’s adversity,  
And in a thousand formes down him sente  
For love in erthe, and whom yow liste, he hente.

4

Ye fierce Mars apesen of his ire,  
And, as yow list, ye maken hertes digne;  
Algates, hem that ye wol set a-fyre,  
They dreden shame, and vices they resigne;  
Ye do hem corteys be, fresshe and benigne.  
And hye or lowe, after a wight entendeth;  
The joyes that he hath, your might him sendeth.

5

Ye holden regne and hous in unitee;  
Ye soothfast cause of frendship been also;  
Ye knowe al thilke covered qualitee  
Of thinges which that folk on wondren so.  
Whan they can not construe how it may jo,  
She loveth him, or why he loveth here;  
As why this fish, and nought that, cometh to were.

6

Ye folk a lawe han set in universe,  
And this knowe I by hem that lovers be.  
That who-so stryveth with yow hath the werse.  
Now, lady bright, for thy benignitee,  
At reverence of hem that serven thee,  
Whos clerk I am, so techeth me devyse  
Som joye of that is felt in thy servyse.

7

Ye in my naked herte sentement  
Inhelde, and do me shewe of thy swetnesse. —  
Calliope, thy vois be now present.  
For now is nede; sestow not my destresse.  
How I mot telle anon-right the gladnesse  
Of Troilus, to Venus heryinge?  
To which gladnes, who nede hath,  
God him bringe!

Lay al this mene whyle Troilus,  
Recordinge his lesson in this manere,  
“Ma fey!” thought he, “thus wole I seye and thus;  
Thus wole I pleyne unto my lady dere;  
That word is good, and this shal be my chere;  
This nil I not foryeten in no wyse.”  
God leve him werken as he gan devyse.

9

And lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,  
Heringe hir come, and shorte for to syke!  
And Pandarus, that ladde hir by the lappe,  
Com neer, and gan in at the curtin pike,  
And seyde, “God do bote on alle syk!  
See, who is here yow comen to visite;  
Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.”

10

Ther-with it semed as he wepte almost;  
“A ha,” quod Troilus so rewfully,  
“Wher me be wo, O mighty god, thou wost!  
Who is al there? I see nought trewely.”  
“Sire,” quod Criseyde, “it is Pandare and I.”

11

“What, you, my dere! Alas that I can’t rise  
And do you honor in a fitting wise.”  

He raised him up, but she ab once drew nigh,  
Her two restraining hands on him to lay.  
“O, please,” she cried, “for my sake please don’t try!  
(O, what was that I had in mind to say!)  
Sir, here I come for two things, if I may.  
To thank you first, then ask you as my lord  
Your favor and protection to accord.”

## BOOK III

> Hearing his lady to him humbly pray  
> For lordship, Troilus from shame near dead —  
> Had not a single word to her to say,  
> For he could think of none to save his head;  
> But suddenly he flushed a crimson red,  
> And all the clever things he’d counted on  
> Fled from his mind, completely lost and gone.  
>  
> 13
>  
> Cressida understood this well enough,  
> For she was wise, and liked him none the less  
> Because he was not pert or quick and rough,  
> Nor yet so bold he lacked all humbleness.  
> But when his shame had passed its first excess,  
> His words, as in my way they can be told,  
> And as the old books say, I shall unfold.  
>  
> 14
>  
> With strange and trembling voice, from simple dread  
> Abashed, and blushing now from ear to ear,  
> But changing often too, now pale, now red,  
> To Cressida, his chosen lady dear,  
> Submissive standing at his side so near —  
> Lo, all he said when he his lips could part  
> Was, twice, “O mercy, mercy, my sweetheart!”
>  
> 15
>  
> He paused, and when he tried again at length,  
> His next word was, “God knows that I have been  
> All yours, with all I have of wit and strength,  
> And shall be yours, by him who saves from sin,  
> Until they dig my grave and put me in!  
> And though I’m slow of speech and hesitate,  
> My love by that you must not estimate.
>  
> 16
>  
> “So much at present, O thou woman true,  
> I may declare, and if these words displease,  
> With my own life I’ll make the payment due,  
> If by my death I may your wrath appease,  
> And bring your heart again to rest and ease.  
> For now that you have let me have my say,  
> I care not how or when I pass away.”
>  
> 17
>  
> Such manly sorrow in his bosom burned,  
> Tears from a heart of stone it would have drawn,  
> And Pandar wept as though to water turned,  
> And nudged his niece anon and yet anon,  
> And said, “Was ever man so woe-begone!  
> For God’s sake, bring this matter to an end,  
> And save us both, and on your ways then wend!”
>  
> 18
>  
> “What’s that?” cried she, “I know not for my part  
> Just what it is you’re asking me to say!”

>  
> ‘Ye, swete herte? alias, I may nought ryse

> And nothing hindered me then to declare  
> The truth to you. Now tell me, I request,  
> Since nothing of my love I then confessed,  
> How durst I babble in the general ear,  
> And tremble now, with no one by to hear?

> “But by the God omnipotent I swear,  
> By him who deals to every man his fate,  
> And if I lie, may not Achilles spare  
> To cleave my heart, that I shall not divulgate,  
> Though I should live forever, soon or late,  
> A word of this, or hint to anyone,  
> For all the gifts of God beneath the sun.

> “Rather would I end my days withal,  
> Fettered in prison-cell would rather be,  
> In wretchedness where filthy vermin crawl,  
> In Agamemnon’s harsh captivity;  
> And this in all our temples faithfully,  
> By all our gods tomorrow I will swear,  
> And you can go along and witness bear.

> “I know that thou hast done so very much for me  
> That all thy service I can ne’er repay,  
> I understand quite well, although for thee  
> I died a thousand times and more a day;  
> But as thy slave, and what more can I say,  
> Upon thy wish and will I shall attend,  
> Till death shall bring my life unto its end.

> “But let me now with all my heart beseech  
> That you assign me no such attribute,  
> As I might fairly gather from your speech,  
> That you supposed that all my honest suit  
> Was but a bawdy thing of ill repute.  
> I’m not a scholar, but I’m not a fool.  
> I’ve learned a thing or two outside of school.

> “A man who this affair should undertake  
> For gold or profit, call him what you will!  
> But what you’ve done, you did for pity’s sake,  
> Through goodness of your heart and not for ill.  
> Regard it so, for men of any skill  
> All know that the distinctions subtle are  
> Between two things a good deal similar.

> “And here’s another thing that I declare  
> To wipe from all your act the shameful blot;  
> Behold my sister Polyxena fair,  
> Cassandra, Helen, or any of the lot,  
> Though she be fair with never a stain or spot,  
> Just tell me which of these you’d like to be  
> Your very own, and leave the rest to me!

> “But since thou hast helped me in this wise  
> To save my life, and not for hope of meed,  
> So, for the love of God, this great emprise  
> Carry thou out, for now there is much need;  
> In high and low, in every single deed  
> All thy commands I faithfully will keep,  
> And so good night, and let us go to sleep.”

> Thus each with other was well satisfied,  
> No better friends in all the world could be;  
> The next day, early up and dressed, each hied  
> Him to his regular activity;  
> And Troilus, although he longed to see  
> The one on whom depended all his joy,  
> Took heed all right precautions to employ,

> And every reckless action to restrain  
> With manly will, and each unbridled look;  
> There was no man alive could entertain  
> The least suspicion, such good care he took  
> That none might nose him out by hook or crook.  
> He held himself as lonely as a cloud,  
> From policy, and not that he was proud.

> And all this time of which I now relate,  
> He daily strove with valor and with might  
> The service high of Mars to cultivate  
> In deeds of arms befitting a true knight;  
> And on his couch when darkness followed light  
> He lay, and thought how he might serve  
> His lady best, and thus her thanks deserve.

> I will not say, although his couch was soft,  
> That he in heart was fully at his ease,  
> Or that he turned not on his pillow oft,  
> Nor longed to grasp what was too far to seize.  
> Such lonely nights have little power to please —

> That all would think that nothing was so dear

> And when she saw how nicely all things went,  
> She felt she had no need to be so wary—  
> I mean, of course, no more than necessary.

> And Pandar, ready still to feed the fire,  
> Was ever diligent and close at hand.  
> To please his friend was now his sole desire,  
> He urged him on, was ready at command  
> To carry letters, or for him to stand,  
> When Troilus was busy or away—  
> In short, the perfect confidant to play.

> But if you think that I should now relate

> The little nothings, sweet and intimate,  
> That he meant only for his lady’s ear,  
> I couldn’t do it if I took a year;

> But to the great result! As things stood thus,

> These lovers Cressida and Troilus,  
> Were well content in all this time so sweet.  
> Except that only rarely they could meet,  
> And had so little time their joys to tell,  
> I now proceed to say what next befell.

> Good Pandar, striving still with all his might  
> To lead this matter to a happy end,  
> Thought how to bring unto his house some night  
> His niece so dear, and his still dearer friend,  
> That at their leisure they might there attend  
> To this great love by which they both were bound,  
> And finally a fitting time he found.

> He made his plans with great deliberation,  
> Providing for all things that might avail  
> To help them realize their expectation,  
> However great the toil this might entail,  
> And worked it out so that it could not fail,  
> And that for anyone through it to see,  
> Would be a sheer impossibility.

> To fool all folk his plan was well designed,  
> The spoil-sports and the gossips, all the same;  
> He had no doubts, for all the world is blind,  
> In such affairs, the wild ones and the tame!  
> And now the timbers ready are to frame!  
> There’s nothing lacking now except to know  
> The hour at which to his house she should go.

> And Troilus, who all this plotting knew,  
> And patiently in silent waiting lay,  
> Had also planned with care what he would do,  
> And also, for excuse, that he would say,  
> If he were not about some night or day,  
> That to a certain temple he would go,  
> His duty to the deity to show,

> And solitary there would watch and wake,  
> If some sign from Apollo he might see,  
> Or might behold the holy laurel shake,  
> Or hear Apollo speaking from the tree,  
> To tell him when the Greeks would homeward flee;  
> And therefore let him as he will pretend,  
> And pray Apollo bring all to good end.

> And now we’re coming to the point right soon,  
> For Pandar up and with no great ado,  
> But when there was a changing of the moon  
> And lightless is the world a night or two,  
> And when the clouds foretold a rain in view,  
> To Cressida, his niece’s house he went,  
> And you well know the whole of his intent.

# TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

## BOOK III

### Middle English (Original)

And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce  
Abedde weren, ther as I have seyd,  
There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,  
But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce.  
If any wight was steringe any-where,  
And late hem slepe that abedde were.

100

But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del  
The olde daunce, and every poynt therinne,  
Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,  
He thoughte he wolde upon his werk biginne,  
And gan the stewe-dore al softe unpinne,  
And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette,  
By Troilus adoun right he him sette.

101

And shortly to the poynt right for to gon.  
Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,  
And seyde, "Make thee redy right anon;  
For thou shalt into hevene blisse wende."  
"Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,"  
Quod Troilus, "for never yet no nede  
Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede."

102

Quod Pandarus, "Ne drede thee never a del,  
For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre;  
So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel,  
Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre."  
"Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,"  
Quod Troilus, "as wis as I thee serve;  
And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve."

103

And if I hadde, O Venus ful of mirthe,  
Aspectes badde of Mars or of Satume,  
Or thou combust or let were in my birthe,  
Thy fader pray al thilke harm disturne  
Of grace, and that I glad ayein may come,  
For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,  
I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe.

104

O Jove eek, for the love of faire Europe,  
The whiche in forme of bole away thou fette;  
Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope.  
For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne Jette;  
O Phebus, thenk whan Dane hir-selven shette  
Under the bark, and laurer wex for drede.  
Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede!

105

Mercurie, for the love of Herse eke,  
For which Pallas was with Aglauros wrooth.  
Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke,  
That this viage be not to thee looth.  
O fatal sustren, which, er any clooth  
Me shapen was, my destene me sponne,  
So helpeth to this werk that is bi-gonne!

106

Quod Pandarus, "Thou wrecched mouses herte.  
Art thou agast so that she wol thee byte?  
Why, don this furred cloke upon thy sherte,  
And folowe me, for I wol han the wyte;  
But byd, and lat me go bifore a lyte."  
And with that word he gan un-do a trappe,  
And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.

107

The steme wind so loude gan to route  
That no wight other noyse mighte here;  
And they that layen at the dore withoute,  
Ful sikerly they slepten alle yfere;  
And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere,  
Goth to the dore anon withouten lette,  
Ther-as they laye, and softely it shette.

108

And as he com ayeinward prively,  
His nece awook, and asked "Who goth there?"  
"My dere nece," quod he, "it am I;  
Ne wondreth not, ne have of it no fere";  
And ner he com, and seyde hir in hir ere,  
"No word, for love of God I yow biseche;  
Lat no wight rise and heren of our speche."

109

"What! which wey be ye comen, benedicite?"  
Quod she, "And how thus unwist of hem alle?"  
"Here at this secree trappe-dore," quod he.  
Quod tho Criseyde, "Lat me som wight calle."  
"Ey! God forbede that it sholde falle,"  
Quod Pandarus, "That ye swich foly wroughte!  
They mighte deme thing they never er thoughte!

110

It is nought good a sleping hound to wake,  
Ne yeve a wight a cause to devyne;  
Your wommen slepen alle, I under-take,  
And slepen wolen til the sonne shyne.  
And whan my tale al brought is to an ende,  
Unwist, right as I com, so wol I wende."

111

"Now nece myn, ye shul wel understonde,"  
Quod he, "So as ye wommen demen alle,  
That for to holde in love a man in honde,  
And him hir 'leef' and 'dere herte' calle,  
And maken him an howve above a calle,  
I mene, as love an other in this whyle,  
She doth hir-self a shame, and him a gyle."

112

"Now wherby that I telle yow al this?  
Ye woot your-self, as wel as any wight,  
How that your love al fully graunted is  
To Troilus, the worthieste knight,  
Oon of this world, and ther-to trouthe plyght,  
That, but it were on him along, ye nolde  
Him never falsen, whyl ye liven sholde."

113

"Now stant it thus, that sith I fro yow wente,  
This Troilus, right platly for to seyn,  
Is thurgh a goter, by a prive wente,  
Into my chaumbre come in al this reyn,  
Unwist of every maner wight, certeyn,  
Save of my-self, as wisly have I joye.  
And by that feith I shal Pryam of Troye!"

114

"And he is come in swich peyne and distresse  
That, but he be al fully wood by this,  
He sodeynly mot falle into wodnesse,  
But-if God helpe; and cause why this is,  
He seyth him told is, of a freend of his,  
How that ye sholde love oon that hateth Horaste,  
For sorwe of which this night shal been his laste."

115

Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde,  
Gan sodeynly aboute hir herte colde.  
And with a syk she sorwfully answerde,  
"Allas! I wende, who-so tales tolde,  
My dere herte wolde me not holde  
So lightly fals! alasse! conceytes wronge.  
What harm they doon, for now live I to longe!"

116

"Horaste! alasse! and falsen Troilus?  
I knowe him not, God helpe me so," quod she;  
"Allas! what wikked spirit tolde him thus?  
Now certes, eem, to-morwe, and I him see,  
I shal therof as ful excusen me  
As ever dide womman, if him lyke;"  
And with that word she gan ful sore syke.

117

"O God!" quod she, "so worldly selinesse,  
Which clerkes callen fals felicitee,  
Y-medled is with many a bittemesse!  
Ful anguisshous than is, God woot," quod she,  
"Condicioun of veyn prosperitee;  
For either joyes comen nought yfere,  
Or elles no wight hath hem alwey here."

118

"O brotel wele of mannes joye unstable!  
Of men thou makest but a sport and play!  
All know that they to hold their joye are able,  
Or know it not — there is no other way.  
Now if one knows it not, how may he say  
That he of perfect joy perceives the spark,  
If ignorance still leaves him in the dark?

119

"But if he knows that joy is transitorie,  
As every joy of worldly thing mot flee,  
Than every tyme he that hath in memorie,  
The drede of lesing maketh him that he  
May in no parfit selinesse be.  
And if to lese his joye he set a myte,  
Than semeth it that joye is worth ful lyte."

120

"Wherfore I wol deffyne in this matere,  
That trewely, for ought I can espye,  
Ther is no verray wele in this world here.  
But O, thou wikked serpent Jalousye,  
Thou misbeleved and envious folye,  
Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste,  
That never yet agilte him, that I wiste?"

121

Quod Pandarus, "Thus fallen is this cas."  
"Why, uncle myn," quod she, "who tolde him this?  
Why doth my dere herte thus, alasse?"  
"Ye woot, ye nece myn," quod he, "what is;  
I hope al shal be wel that is amis.  
For ye may quenche al this, if that yow leste.  
And doth right so, for I holde it the beste."

122

"So shal I do to-morwe, y-wis," quod she,  
"And God to-forn, so that it shal suffyse."  
"To-morwe? alasse, that were a fayr," quod he,  
"Nay, nay, it may not stonden in this wyse;  
For, nece myn, thus wryten clerkes wyse,  
That peril is with drecching in y-drawe;  
Nay, swich abodes been nought worth an hawe."

123

"Nece, al thing hath tyme, I dar avowe;  
For whan a chaumber afyr is, or an halle,  
Wel more nede is, it sodeynly rescowe,  
Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle,  
How is this candel in the straw yfalle?  
A! benedicite! for al among that fare  
The harm is doon, and fare-wel feldfare!"

124

"And, nece myn, ne take it not agreef.  
If that ye suffre him al night in this wo,  
God help me so, ye hadde him never leef.  
That dar I seyn, now there is but we two;  
But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so;  
Ye been to wys to do so gret folye,  
To putte his lif al night in jupartye."

125

"Hadde I him never leef? By God, I wene  
Ye hadde never thing so leef," quod she.  
"Now by my thrift," quod he, "that shal be sene;  
For, sin ye make this ensample of me,  
If I al night wolde him in sorwe see,  
For al the tresour in the toun of Troye,  
I bidde God, I never mote have joye!"

126

"Now loke thanne, if ye, that been his love,  
Shul putte al night his lyf in jupartye  
For thing of nought! Now, by that God above,  
Nought only this delay comth of folye,  
But of malyce, if that I shal nought lye.  
What, platly, and ye suffre him in distresse,  
Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!"

127

Quod tho Criseyde, "Wole ye doon o thing,  
And ye therwith shal stinte al his disese;  
Have here, and bereth him this blewe ring.  
For ther is no-thing mighte him bettre plese,  
Save I myself, ne more his herte apese;  
And sey my dere herte, that his sorwe  
Is causeles, that shal be seen to-morwe."

128

"A ring?" quod he, "Ye, hasel-wodes shaken!  
Ye, nece myn, that ring moste han a stoon  
That mighte dede men alyve maken;  
And swich a ring, trowe I that ye have noon.  
Discrecioun out of your heed is goon;  
That fele I now," quod he, "and that is routhe;  
O tyme y-lost, wel maystow cursen slouthe!"

129

"Wot ye not wel that noble and heigh corage  
Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth eek for lyte?  
But if a fool were in a jalous rage,  
I nolde setten at his sorwe a myte.  
But feffe him with a fewe wordes whyte  
Another day, whan that I mighte him finde:  
But this thing stont al in another kinde."

130

"This is so gentil and so tendre of herte,  
That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;  
For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte,  
He wol to yow no jalouse wordes speke.  
And for-thy, nece, er that his herte breke,  
So spek your-self to him of this matere;  
For with o word ye may his herte stere."

131

"Now have I told what peril he is inne,  
And his coming unwist is to every wight;  
Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon ne sinne;  
I wol my-self be with yow al this night.  
Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,  
And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,  
And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste."

132

This accident so pitous was to here,  
And eek so lyk a sooth, at prime face;  
And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,  
His privet coming, and the siker place,  
That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace,  
Considered alle thinges as they stode.  
No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode.

133

Criseyde answerde, "As wicly God at reste  
My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!  
And eem, y-wis, fayn wolde I doon the beste.  
If that I hadde grace to do so.  
But whether that ye dwelle or for him go,  
I am, til God me better minde sende,  
At Dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende."

134

Quod Pandarus, "Ye, nece, wol ye here?  
Dulcarnon called is 'fleming of wreches';  
It semeth hard, for wreches wol not lere  
For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches;  
This seyd by hem that be not worth two feches.  
But ye ben wys, and that we han on honde  
Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde."

135

"Thanne, eem," quod she, "Doth her-of as yow list;  
But er he come I wil up first aryse;  
And, for the love of God, sin al my trist  
Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse,  
So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse,  
That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;  
For I am here al in your govemaunce."

136

"That is wel seyd," quod he, "My nece dere,  
Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte!  
But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here.  
It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;  
And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte.  
For love of God; and, Venus, I thee herie;  
For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie."

137

This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette  
Ful sobrely, right by hir beddes heed,  
And in his beste wyse his lady grette;  
But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed!  
Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed,  
She coude nought a word aright out-bringe  
So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge.

138

But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele  
In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,  
And seyde, "Nece, see how this lord can knele!  
Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!"  
And with that word he for a cushion ran,  
And seyde, "Kneleth now, whyl that yow leste,  
Ther God your hertes bringe sone at reste!"

139

Can I not seyn, for she bad him not rise,  
If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,  
Or elles if she toke it in the wyse  
Of duttee, as for his observaunce;  
But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,  
That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore;  
And bad him sitte adoun withouten more.

140

Quod Pandarus, "Now wol ye wel beginne;  
Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,  
Upon your beddes syde al there withinne,  
That ech of yow the bet may other here."  
And with that word he drow him to the fere,  
And took a light, and fond his contenaunce  
As for to loke upon an old romance.

### Modern English (Cleaned Translation / Editorial Rendering)

And all her women, by ordinance,  
Were abed, as I have said;  
There was nothing more to skip or to dance,  
But they were bid to go to bed, with mischance.  
If any person was stirring anywhere,  
Let those in bed sleep late and be unaware.

100

But Pandarus, who could well every part  
Of the old dance and every point therein,  
When he saw that everything was right,  
Determined to begin his work forthwith;  
He softly unpinned the stew-door,  
And, still as a stone, without any further hindrance,  
Sat himself down by Troilus.

101

And, shortly to the point:  
Of all this business he told him word and end,  
And said, "Make yourself ready right away;  
For you shall go to heaven's bliss."  
"Now blissful Venus, grant me grace,"  
Quoth Troilus, "for never have I had such need,  
Nor ever the half of this dread before."

102

Said Pandarus, "Fear not in the least,  
For it shall be just as you desire;  
So thrive I, this night I will make it well,  
Or cast all the horror into the fire."  
"Yet blissful Venus, this night inspire me,"  
Quoth Troilus, "as truly as I serve you;  
And ever better and better shall be, till I die."

103

"And if I had, O Venus, full of mirth,  
Bad aspects of Saturn or of Mars,  
Or if you had been quenched or hindered at my birth,  
Pray to your father that he might turn aside this harm,  
And grant that I may once again be glad,  
For the love of him whom you loved in the wood,  
I mean Adonis, who was slain by the boar."

104

"O Jove, you lover of fair Europa,  
Who in the form of a bull carried her away,  
Now help! O Mars, who bears the bloody cloak,  
For love of Venus, hinder me not I pray!  
O Phoebus, recall how Daphne once pined,  
And beneath the bark changed to a laurel:  
Help me now, for love of her so true!"

105

"O Mercury, I beg in Herse's name,  
Though Pallas was angry at Aglauros,  
Now help! Diana, let not modest shame  
Dissuade you from aiding me and abetting!  
O Fatal Sisters, ere my nurse made yet  
My swaddling clothes, you spun my destiny—  
So help me in this work that is begun!"

106

Said Pandar, "O, you chicken-hearted wretch!  
Are you afraid because you think she'll bite?  
Put something on—this over-cloak—just fetch it,  
And follow me to see a sight!  
But wait; I'll go ahead to make all right!"  
Then he undid a little trap-door,  
And brought Troilus in by the lap.

107

The stormy wind so loudly roared about  
That no other sound could anywhere be heard;  
And those whose beds stood near the outer door  
Slept soundly and not a single person stirred.  
Pandarus went to the door at once, with a sober face,  
Where they lay, and he softly shut it tight.

108

He came back again, very still and stealthily,  
But Cressida awoke and cried, "Who goes there?"  
"Dear niece," he softly said, "it is only me;  
Do not be startled, have no fear."  
And near he came, whispering into her ear,  
"No word, for love of God I beseech you;  
Let no one rise and hear of our speech."

109

"What! Which way have you come, benedicite?"  
She said, "And how is it that they know nothing?"  
"Here, at this secret trap-door," he answered.  
Then Cressida said, "Let me call someone."  
"Ah! God forbid that it should happen,"  
Said Pandarus, "that you should act such folly!  
They might suppose things they never before thought."

110

"It is not good to wake a sleeping hound,  
Nor give any cause for suspicion;  
Your women sleep all, I undertake,  
And will sleep until the sun shall shine.  
And when my tale has been told to an end,  
Unseen, just as I came, so will I go."

111

"Now, my niece, you shall well understand,"  
Said he, "as you women all judge,  
That to keep a man in love within your hand,  
And call him her 'lief' and 'dear heart,'  
And make him a boast above his rank—  
I mean, as love one with another in this while—  
She does herself a shame and him a deceit."

112

"Now why do I tell you all this?  
You know yourself, as well as any person,  
That all your love is fully granted  
To Troilus, the worthiest knight,  
One of this world, and furthermore pledged in troth;  
That, unless it were his sole fault, you would not  
Fail him while you live."

113

"Now it stands thus, that since I went from you,  
This Troilus, plainly to say,  
Has crept through a gutter, by a private way,  
Into my chamber in all this rain,  
Unknown to every kind of person, certainly,  
Save me myself, as truly I have joy.  
And by that faith I shall proclaim the fame of Troy!"

114

"And he has come in such pain and distress  
That, unless he be completely mad from this,  
He must suddenly fall into madness,  
Unless God helps; and the cause of this is  
He says he has been told, by a friend of his,  
That you should love one named Horaste,  
For sorrow of which this night shall be his last."

115

Cressida, who heard all this wonder,  
Suddenly felt her heart grow cold.  
And with a sigh she sorrowfully answered,  
"Alas! I thought, whatever tales were told,  
My dear heart would not hold me so lightly false!  
Alas! what wrong conceits these are.  
What harm they do—now I seem to live too long!"

116

"Horaste! Alas! and false to Troilus?  
I know him not, God help me so," she said;  
"Alas! what wicked spirit told him thus?  
Now certainly, tomorrow, if I see him,  
I shall fully excuse myself of that,  
As any woman would, if it please him;"  
And with that word she sighed sorely.

117

"O God!" she cried, "such worldly falseness,  
Which scholars call false felicity,  
Is mingled with much bitterness!  
Full of anguish is the condition, God knows," she said,  
"Of empty prosperity;  
For either joys do not come together,  
Or else no one has them always here."

118

"O fragile welfare of man's joy unstable!  
Of men thou makest but a sport and play!  
All know that they are able to keep their joy,  
Or do not know it — there is no other way.  
Now if one knows it not, how may he say  
That he perceives the spark of perfect joy,  
If ignorance still leaves him in the dark?"

119

"But if he knows that joy is transitory,  
As every joy of worldly things must flee,  
Then every time he who has it in memory,  
The dread of losing it makes that he  
May be in no perfect happiness.  
And if to lose his joy he sets a mite,  
Then it seems that joy is worth very little."

120

"Wherefore I will define in this matter,  
That truly, for all I can see,  
There is no true welfare in this world here.  
But O, thou wicked serpent Jealousy,  
Thou misbelieving and envious folly,  
Why hast thou made Troilus distrust me,  
Who never yet wronged him, as I knew?"

121

Said Pandarus, "Thus fallen is this case."  
"Why, my uncle," she said, "who told him this?  
Why does my dear heart act so, alas?"  
"You know, my niece," he said, "what it is;  
I hope all shall be well that is amiss.  
For you may quench all this, if it please you.  
And do so, for I hold it the best."

122

"So shall I do tomorrow, truly," she said,  
"And God before, so that it shall suffice."  
"Tomorrow? Alas, that would be a mock," he said,  
"No, no, it may not stand in this fashion;  
For, my niece, thus write wise clerks,  
That peril increases with delaying;  
No, such delays are not worth a straw."

123

"Niece, everything has its time, I dare avow;  
For when a chamber is afire, or a hall,  
More need is to rescue suddenly  
Than to dispute and ask among all,  
How did this candle come to fall in the straw?  
Ah! benedicite! for among such dealings  
The harm is done, and fare thee well, fieldfare!"

124

"And, my niece, do not take it as grief.  
If you suffer him all night in this woe,  
God help me so, you would never have him dear.  
That I dare say, now there is but we two;  
But well I know that you will not do so;  
You are too wise to commit so great folly,  
To put his life all night in jeopardy."

125

"Would I have never loved him? By God, I think  
You never had anything so dear," she said.  
"Now by my thrift," he said, "that shall be seen;  
For, since you make this example of me,  
If I all night would suffer to see him in sorrow,  
For all the treasure in the town of Troy,  
I pray God I may never have joy!"

126

"Now look then, if you, who are his love,  
Shall put all night his life in jeopardy  
For a thing of nought! Now, by that God above,  
Not only does this delay come from folly,  
But from malice, if I shall not lie.  
What, plainly, if you suffer him in distress,  
You neither do bounty nor gentleness!"

127

Then Cressida said, "Will you do one thing,  
And thereby will you stanch all his disease:  
Take this and bear him this blue ring.  
For there is nothing that would please him better,  
Except myself, nor more appease his heart;  
And tell my dear heart that his sorrow  
Is groundless, that shall be seen tomorrow."

128

"A ring?" he said, "Ay, the hazel woods be shaken!  
Yes, niece mine, that ring must have a stone  
That could make dead men alive again;  
And such a ring, I believe you have none.  
Discretion has gone out of your head;  
That I feel now," said he, "and that is pity;  
O time lost, well may you curse your sloth!"

129

"Know you not well that noble and high courage  
Does not grieve nor cease for a little thing?  
But if a fool were in a jealous rage,  
I would not esteem his sorrow a mite.  
But give him a few fitting words another day,  
When I might find him: yet this matter stands  
In a quite different kind."

130

"This man is so gentle and so tender of heart,  
That with his death he will avenge his sorrows;  
For trust well, however sorely he smart,  
He will to you speak no jealous words.  
And therefore, niece, before his heart break,  
So speak yourself to him of this matter;  
For with one word you may stir his heart."

131

"Now have I told what peril he is in,  
And his coming is unknown to every person;  
No, by God, there may be neither harm nor sin;  
I myself will be with you all this night.  
You know also how he is your own knight,  
And that, by right, you must place trust in him,  
And I am ready to fetch him when you list."

132

This accident was so pitiful to hear,  
And also so like the truth at first sight,  
And Troilus her knight to her so dear,  
His private coming, and the secure place,  
That, though she then showed him a favor,  
She considered all things as they stood.  
No wonder it is, since she did all for good.

133

Cressida answered, "As truly as God rest my soul,  
I am sorrowful for him! And, indeed, truly,  
I would gladly do the best that I can.  
If I had grace to do so.  
But whether you remain or go for him,  
I am, until God send me better counsel,  
At Dulcarnon, right at my wit's end."

134

Quoth Pandarus, "Yes, niece, will you hear?  
Dulcarnon is called the 'failing of wretches';  
It seems hard, for wretches will not learn  
By sheer sloth or other willful faults;  
This said by those who are not worth two farthings.  
But you are wise, and that which we have in hand  
Is neither hard nor skilful to withstand."

135

"Then, uncle," she said, "Do as you think best;  
But ere he comes I will first arise;  
And, for the love of God, since all my trust  
Is on you two, and you are both wise,  
So devise now in so discreet a wise  
That I may have honor and he pleasure;  
For I am here entirely in your governance."

136

"That is well said," he said, "my dear niece;  
There is good thrift in that wise gentle heart!  
But lie still, and take him right here;  
There is no need for him to go further;  
And each of you may ease the other's sorrow.  
For the love of God; and, Venus, I praise thee;  
For soon I hope we shall all be merry."

137

This Troilus full soon set himself on knees  
Full soberly, right by her bed's head,  
And in his best fashion greeted his lady;  
But, lord, how she suddenly grew red!  
No, though men should strike off her head,  
She could not bring forth one proper word  
So suddenly, for his sudden coming.

138

But Pandarus, who so well could feel  
In every thing, to play forthwith began,  
And said, "Niece, see how this lord can kneel!  
Now, for your truth, look on this gentle man!"  
And with that word he ran for a cushion,  
And said, "Kneel now, while it pleases you;  
There God bring your hearts soon to rest!"

139

I cannot say whether she bade him not rise,  
If sorrow drove the thought from her remembrance,  
Or else if she took it in the manner  
Of duty, for his observance;  
But well I find she did him this favor,  
That she kissed him, although she sighed sore,  
And bade him sit down without further word.

140

Quoth Pandarus, "Now will you well begin;  
Now set him to sit, good niece dear,  
Upon your bed's side there within,  
That each of you the better may hear the other."  
And with that word he drew him to the fire,  
And took a light, and set his countenance  
As if to look upon an old romance.

# BOOK III

### Middle English

Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,  
And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,  
Although she, hir servaunt and hir knight  
Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse.  
Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,  
And that love is in cause of swich folye,  
Thus to him spak she of his jelousye:

“Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence  
Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,  
Ne oghte eek goodly maken resistence;  
And eek bycause I felte wel and say  
Your grete trouthe, and servyse every day;  
And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne,  
This droof me for to rewe upon your peyne.

And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,  
Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,  
I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,  
Al can I nought as muche as it were right;  
And I, emforth my conninge and my might,  
Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,  
Ben to yow trewe and hool, with al myn herte;

And dredeles, that shal be founde at preve. —  
But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne  
Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,  
Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne.  
For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne,  
That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse,  
Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.

My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how  
That Jalousye, alas! that wikked wivere,  
Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow;  
The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere!  
Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere,  
Should have his reflut in so digne a place,  
Ther Jove him sone out of your herte arace.

But O, thou Jove, O auctor of nature,  
Is this an honour to thy deitee,  
That folk ungiltif suffren here injure,  
And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?  
O were it leful for to pleyne on thee,  
That undeserved suffrest jalousye,  
And that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye!

Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen  
To seyn right thus, ‘Ye, jealousy is Love!’  
And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,  
For that one grein of love is on it shove!  
But that wot heighe god that sit above,  
If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame;  
And after that, it oghte bere his name.

But certeyn is, som maner jealousy  
Is excusable more than som, ywis;

As whan ther’s cause, or whan folk long repress  
Som harsh fantastic notion in hir minds,  
Which in expression no free outlet finds,  
And on itself it thus doth grow and feed;  
For such repression is a gentle deed.

And some so ful of furie is and despite  
That it sourmounteth his repressioun;  
But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt,  
That thanke I God, for whiche your passioun  
I wol not calle it but illusioun  
Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,  
That dooth your herte this disese endure.

Of which I am right sory, but not wrooth;  
But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,  
Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth,  
By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste,  
For love of God, lat preve it for the beste!  
And if that I be giltif, do me deye,  
Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?”

With that a fewe brighte teres newe  
Out of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde,  
“Now God, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe  
To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.”  
With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde,  
And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore,  
And held hir pees; not a word spak she more.

Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette,  
That from his eyen fil ther not a tere,  
And every spirit his vigour in-knettes  
So they astoned and oppressed were.  
The feling of his sorwes or of his fere  
Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;  
And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.

This was no litel sorwe for to se;  
But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,  
“O nece, pees, or we be lost,” quod he,  
“Beth nought agast”; but certeyn, at the laste,  
For this or that, he into bedde him caste,  
And seyde, “O theef, is this a mannes herte?”  
And of he rente al to his bare sherte;

And seyde, “Nece, but ye helpe us now,  
Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!”  
“Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,  
Ful fayn,” quod she; “alas! that I was born!”  
“Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn  
That stiketh in his herte?” quod Pandare;  
“Sey ‘al foryeve,’ and stint is all this fare!”

“Ye, that to me,” quod she, “ful lever were  
Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth”;  
And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere,  
“Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth.  
Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;  
Now speek to me, for it am I, Criseyde!”

But al for nought; yet mighte he not abreyde.  
Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes  
They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne.  
And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,  
She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,  
Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne.  
And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,  
And of his swough sone after that adawe,  
And gan bet minde and reson to him take.  
But wonder sore he was abayst, ywis.  
And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake,  
He seyde, “O mercy, God, what thing is this?”  
“Why do ye with yourselves thus amis?”  
Quod tho Criseyde, “Is this a mannes game?  
What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?”

And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde,  
And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste.  
He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde  
As fil to purpos for his herte reste.  
And she to that answerde him as hir leste;  
And with hir goodly wordes him disporte  
She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.

Quod Pandarus, “for ought I can espyen,  
This light nor I ne serven here of nought;  
Light is not good for syke folkes’ yen.  
But for the love of God, sin ye be brought  
In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought  
Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye”;  
And bar the candel to the chimeneye.

Sone after this, though it no ned were,  
Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse  
Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,  
Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse.  
Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse  
In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,  
That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.

But in effect she wolde wite anoon  
Of what man, and eek where, and also why  
He jelous was, sin ther was cause noon;  
And eek the signe, that he took it by,  
She bad him that to telle hir bisily,  
Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde,  
That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.

With-outen more, shortly for to seyne,  
He moste obeye unto his lady heste;  
And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.  
He seyde hir, whan she was at swich a feste  
She mighte on him han loked at the leste;  
Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe,  
As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.

And she answerde, “Swete, al were it so,  
What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene?  
For, by that God that boughte us bothe two,  
In alle thinge is myn entente clene.  
Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;  
Wol ye the childish jalous contrefete?  
Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.”

Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke,  
Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde;  
And seyde, “Alas! upon my sorwes syke  
Have mercy, swete herte myn, Criseyde!  
And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde,  
Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;  
Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.”

And she answerde, “Of gilt misericorde!  
That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;  
And ever-more on this night yow recorde.  
And beth wel war ye do no more amis.”  
“Nay, dere herte myn,” quod he, “ywIS.”  
“And now,” quod she, “that I have do yow smerte,  
Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.”

This Troilus, with blisse of that suprysed,  
Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente  
No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed,  
He hir in armes faste to him hente.  
And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,  
Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, “If ye ben wyse,  
Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.”

What mighte or may the sely larke seye,  
Whan that the sparhauk hath it in his foot?

I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye  
To whom this tale sucre be or soot.  
Though that I tarie a yeer, somtyme I moot,  
After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,  
As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.

Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take,  
Right as writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,  
Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,  
Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.  
But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,  
Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;  
Thus sondry peynes bringen folk to hevene.

This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne,  
And seyde, “O swete, as ever mote I goon.  
Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne;  
Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.”  
To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,  
“Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere,  
Ben yolde, ywis, I were now not here!”

O! sooth is seyd, that heled for to be  
As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse,  
Men moste drinke, as men may often see,  
Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse  
Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse;  
I mene it here, as for this aventure,  
That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure.

And now swetnesse semeth more swete,  
That bitternesse assayed was biforn;  
For out of wo in blisse now they flete.  
Non swich they felten, sith they were born;  
Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!  
For love of God, take every womman hede  
To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.

Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,  
As she that juste cause hadde him to triste,  
Made him swich feste, it joye was to sene,  
Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.  
And as about a tree, with many a twiste,  
Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde,  
Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.

And as the newe abaysshed nightingale,  
That stinteth first whan she biginneth singe,  
Whan that she hereth any herde tale,  
Or in the hegges any wight steringe,  
And after siker dooth hir vois out-ringe;  
Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,  
Opened hir herte, and tolde him hir entente.

And right as he that seeth his deeth y-shapen,  
And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse,  
And sodeynly rescous doth him escapen,  
And from his deeth is brought in sikemesse,  
For al this world, in swich present gladnesse  
Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;  
With worse hap God lat us never mete!

Her armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe,  
Hir sydes longe, fleshy, smothe, and whyte  
He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte  
Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte;  
Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte,  
And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste;  
That, what to done, for joye unnethe he wiste.

Than seyde he thus, “O, Love, O, Charite,  
Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,  
After thy-self next heried be she,  
Venus men I, the wel-willy planete;  
And next that, Hymen, I thee grete;  
For never man was to yow goddes holde  
As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.

Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,  
Who-so wol grace, and list thee nought honouren,  
Lo, his desyr wol flee with-outen winges.  
For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren  
That serven best and most alwey labouren,  
Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes,  
But-if thy grace passed our desertes.

And for thou me, that coude leest deserve  
Of hem that nombred been unto thy grace,  
Hast holpen, ther I lykly was to sterve.

### Modern English (Translation)

Cressida, who was truly Troilus’s lady,  
And stood clear on a ground of security,  
Although she thought that her servant and her knight  
Should in no way be considered unfaithful to her.  
Yet nonetheless, considering his distress,  
And knowing that love is often the cause of such folly,  
Thus she spoke to him about his jealousy:

“My heart, if only the excellence of love —  
Against which no man can or ought to resist —  
Were such that, because I have seen and known  
Your great fidelity and daily service,  
And that your heart has been entirely mine, indeed,  
I am moved to pity for your pain.

And your goodness I have found always to remain,  
For which, my dear heart and my entire knight,  
I thank you as far as my wit allows;  
I cannot fully give you as much as were your due,  
Yet, with my knowledge and my strength,  
Have, and always shall, however it may grieve me,  
Be to you true and whole with all my heart;

And doubtless, that shall be proved. —  
But, my heart, whatever this is to say  
Shall be told you well, so that you do not take offense,  
Although I seem to complain directly to you.  
For by this I mean finally the pain  
That holds your heart and mine in heaviness,  
To slay it utterly, and to right every wrong.

My good one, I do not know why or how  
That jealousy, alas! that wicked serpent,  
Should thus, without cause, creep into you;  
The harm of which I would gladly deliver you!  
Alas! that he, wholly himself or any part of him,  
Should have such refuge in so worthy a place,  
That Jove might quickly pluck him out of your heart.

But O, thou Jove, O author of nature,  
Is this an honor to thy deity,  
That innocent folk here should suffer wrong,  
And the guilty one go free altogether?  
O that it were lawful to complain of thee,  
I would accuse thy mighty name,  
For undeserved jealousy I bear the blame.

Also my sorrow is that folk now use  
To say straight out, ‘Yes, jealousy is Love!’  
And they would excuse a bushel of venom,  
If they can thrust in a grain of love with it!  
But God on high who sits above knows best  
Whether it is more like love or like hate or wrath;  
And by that it ought to be named.

But certainly some kinds of jealousy  
Are more excusable than others, indeed;

As when there is cause, or when men long repress  
Some harsh fantastic notion in their minds,  
Which finds no free outlet in expression,  
And thus feeds and grows upon itself;  
For such repression is a gentle deed.

And some are full of fury and despite,  
So that they overcome all restraint;  
But, my heart, you are not in that plight,  
For which I thank God, and therefore your passion  
I will not call anything but illusion  
From abundance of love and busy care,  
That makes your heart endure this disease.

Of which I am truly sorry, but not angry;  
But, for my duty and for the rest of your heart,  
Wherever you please, by ordeal or by oath,  
By lot, or in whatever way you think best,  
For God’s love, let it be proven for the best!  
And if I be guilty, put me to death!  
Alas! what more might I do or say?”

With that a few bright tears newly  
Fell from her eyes, and thus she said,  
“Now God, thou knowest, in thought nor deed untrue  
Was Cressida to Troilus never yet.”  
With that her head she laid down in the bed,  
And with the sheet wrapped it, and sighed sore,  
And held her peace; not another word she spoke.

Though sorrow so shut his heart within,  
From his eyes there fell not a single tear,  
And every spirit, his vigor bound and knotted,  
So that they were astounded and oppressed.  
The sense of his sorrows or of his fear  
Or anything else fled was out of the town;  
And down he fell all suddenly into a swoon.

This was no little sorrow to see;  
But all was hushed, and Pandarus up as fast,  
“Hush, niece, peace, or we are lost,” said he,  
“Be not afraid”; but certain, at the last,  
For this or that, he cast him into the bed,  
And said, “O thief, is this a man’s heart?”  
And he tore off all to his bare shirt;

And said, “Niece, unless you help us now,  
Alas, your own Troilus is lost!”  
“Truly, I would gladly, if I knew how,”  
Said she; “alas! that I was born!”  
“Yes, niece, will you pull out the thorn  
That sticks in his heart?” said Pandarus;  
“Say ‘All is forgiven,’ and the matter is ended!”

“That were to me,” she said, “far dearer  
Than all the goods the circling sun goes round.”  
And thereupon she swore him in his ear,  
“By all the oaths by which I can be bound,  
I am not angry,”— yet he made no sound.  
“It is Cressida, O speak, my precious heart!”  
But from his trance she could not awaken him.

His wrists and palms then they began to rub,  
And they wetted both his temples with water,  
To free him from his bitter bonds,  
And often she kissed him; and, in short,  
All her pains she took to call him back.  
And at the last he began to draw breath,  
And of his swoon soon after that came awake,  
And began to take better mind and reason.  
But he was sorely abashed, truly.  
And with a sigh, when he was better awake,  
He said, “O mercy, God, what thing is this?”  
“Why do you behave thus to yourself?”  
Said then Cressida, “Is this a man’s game?  
What, Troilus! will you act thus, for shame?”

And with that her arm she laid over him,  
And forgave him, and kissed him oftentimes.  
He thanked her, and to her spoke and said  
Such things as served to purpose for his heart’s rest.  
And she answered him as pleased her;  
And with her goodly words she comforted him,  
And oft set his sorrows to rest.

Said Pandarus, “For all that I can espy,  
This light nor I serve not here for naught;  
Light is not good for sick folk’s eyes.  
But for the love of God, since you are brought  
Into such good plight, let now no heavy thought  
Be hanging in the hearts of you two”;  
And he carried the candle to the chimney-side.

Soon after this, though it were not needful,  
When she had taken such oaths as she pleased of him,  
She thought then no fear, nor cause too, to bid him rise.  
Yet less than oaths may suffice in many a case;  
For every person, I suppose, who loves well  
Means but gentleness.

But in effect she would know at once  
Of what man, and also where, and why  
He was jealous, since there was no cause;  
And also the sign by which he took it,  
She bade him tell that to her busily,  
Or else, certainly, she swore in his hand,  
That this was done from malice, to spy on her.

Without more, shortly to say,  
He must obey unto his lady’s command;  
And for the less harm, he must feign.  
He said to her, when she was at such a feast  
She might have looked on him at least;  
Not I know what, a dear enough jest,  
As he that needs must find a cause.

And she answered, “Sweetheart, though it were so,  
What harm was that, since I meant no evil?  
For, by that God who bought us both two,  
In all things is my intent pure.  
Such arguments are not worth a bean;  
Will you the childish jealous counterfeit?  
Now it were worthy that you were beaten.”

Then Troilus began sorrowfully to sigh,  
Lest she be wroth, him thought his heart died;  
And said, “Alas! upon my sorrows sigh,  
Have mercy, sweet heart of mine, Cressida!  
And if in those words that I said  
Be any wrong, I will no more trespass;  
Do what you list, I am all in your grace.”

And she answered, “Of kindly mercy!  
That is to say, I forgive all this;  
And evermore this night I record you.  
And be well wary you do no more amiss.”  
“Nay, dear heart of mine,” said he, “ywise.”  
“And now,” said she, “that I have done you harm,  
Forgive it me, my own sweet heart.”

This Troilus, with the bliss of that surprised,  
Put all in God’s hand, as he who meant  
Nothing but well; and suddenly advised,  
He took her in his arms fast to him.  
And Pandarus, with a full good intent,  
Laid him to sleep, and said, “If you be wise,  
Swoon not now, lest more folk arise.”

What might or may the poor lark say,  
When the sparrow-hawk hath it in his foot?

I can no more, but of these same two —  
To whom this tale sugar be or soot.  
Though I should tarry a year, sometime I must,  
After my author, tell their gladness,  
As well as I have told their heaviness.

Cressida, who felt herself thus taken,  
As clerks write in their old books,  
Like an aspen leaf she began to quake,  
When she felt him fold her in his arms.  
But Troilus, all whole of care and cold,  
Gave thanks then to the blissful gods seven;  
Thus sundry pains bring folk to heaven.

Troilus in arms began to press her,  
And said, “O sweet, as ever I may go.  
Now you are caught, now are there but we twain;  
Now yield yourself, for other boot is none.”  
To that Cressida answered thus anon,  
“Had I not yielded earlier, my sweet heart dear,  
Truly, I were now not here!”

O! true it is, that to be healed  
As from a fever or other great sickness,  
One must drink, as one may often see,  
A very bitter draught; and to have gladness  
Men oft drink pain and great distress;  
I mean it here, as for this adventure,  
That through a pain he found all his cure.

And now sweetness seems the more sweet,  
That bitterness had been tried before;  
For out of woe into bliss now they flee.  
None such they felt since they were born;  
Now is this better than both being lost!  
For God’s love, every woman take heed  
To work thus, if it come to the need.

Cressida, all quit from every dread and grief,  
As she who had just cause to trust him,  
Made him such feast, it was joy to see,  
When she knew his troth and clean intent.  
And like the woodbine, with many a twist,  
Wound and entwined the sweet wood-bind,  
So each of them their arms about the other wind.

And as the new, abashed nightingale,  
That stints first when she begins to sing,  
When she hears any herding tale,  
Or in the hedges any creature stirring,  
And after sure lets her voice ring forth;  
Right so Cressida, when her dread ceased,  
Opened her heart, and told him her intent.

And just as he who sees his death fashioned,  
And must die, in anything that he may guess,  
And suddenly rescue causes him to escape,  
And from his death is brought to sickness,  
For all this world, in such present gladness  
Was Troilus, and has his lady sweet;  
With worse hap God let us never meet!

Her arms small, her straight back and soft,  
Her long sides, fleshy, smooth, and white,  
He began to stroke, and often well regarded  
Her snowy throat, her round and modest breasts;  
Thus in this heaven he began to delight,  
And withal a thousand times he kissed her;  
That, what to do, for joy hardly he knew.

Then said he thus, “O Love, O Charity,  
Thy mother also, Cytherea the sweet,  
After thyself next be praised she,  
Venus I mean, the kindly planet;  
And next that, Hymen, I greet thee;  
For never man was held to you gods  
As I, whom ye have brought from cold cares.

Benign Love, thou holy bond of things,  
Whoever wills grace, and lists not to honor thee,  
Lo, his desire will flee without wings.  
For, wouldst thou not of bounty succor those  
That serve best and most always labor,  
Yet were all lost, that dare I well say, certes,  
Unless thy grace passed our deserts.

And for thou me, that could least deserve  
Of those that are numbered unto thy grace,  
Hast helped, where I likely was to perish.

## BOOK III

### Middle English

And therwith-al Criseyde anoon he kiste,  
Of which, certein, she felte no disese.

And thus seyde he, “Now wolde God I wiste,  
Myn herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!  
What man,” quod he, “was ever thus at ese  
As I, on which the faireste and the beste  
That ever I say, deyneth hir herte reste.

Here may men seen that mercy passeth right;  
The experience of that is felt in me.  
That am unworthy to so swete a wight.  
But herte myn, of your benignitee  
So thenketh, though that I unworthy be,  
Yet mot I nede amenden in som wise,  
Right thourgh the vertu of your heighe servise.

And for the love of God, my lady dere,  
Sin God hath wrought me for I shal yow serve,  
As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere,  
To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve.  
So techeth me how that I may deserve  
Your thank, so that I, thurgh myn ignoraunce,  
Ne do no-thing that yow be displesaunce.

For certes, fresh wommanliche wif,  
This dar I seye, that trouthe and diligence  
That shal ye finden in me al my lyf,  
Ne I wol not, certein, breken your defence;  
And if I do, present or in absence,  
For love of God, lat slee me with the dede,  
If that it lyke unto your womanhede.”

“Y-wis,” quod she, “myn owne hertes list,  
My ground of ese, and al myn herte dere,  
Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist;  
But late us falle awey fro this matere;  
For it suffyseth, this that seyd is here.  
And at o word, with-outen repentaunce,  
Wel-come, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!”

Of hir delyt, or joyes oon the leste  
Were impossible to my wit to seye;  
But juggeth, ye that han ben at the feste  
Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pley!  
I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweye  
That night, betwixen dreed and sikemesse,  
Felten in love the grete worthinesse.

O blisful night, of hem so longe y-sought,  
How blithe unto hem bothe two thou were!  
Why ne hadde I swich on with my soule y-bought,  
Ye, or the leeste joye that was there?  
A-wey, thou foule daunger and thou fere,  
And lat hem in this hevene blisse dwelle,  
That is so heigh, that al ne can I telle!

But sooth is, though I can not tellen al,  
As can myn auctor, of his excellence.  
Yet have I seyd, and, God to-forn, I shal  
In every thing al hoolly his sentence.  
And if that I, at loves reverence,  
Have any word in eched for the beste,  
Doth therwith-al right as your-selven leste.

For myne wordes, here and every part,  
I speke hem alle under correccioun  
Of yow, that feling han in loves art.  
And putte it al in your discrecioun  
To encrese or maken diminucioun  
Of my langage, and that I yow biseche;  
But now to purpos of my rather speche.

Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,  
So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were,  
That ech from other wende been biraft,  
Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,  
That al this thing but nyce dremes were;  
For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, “O swete,  
Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?”

And, lord! so he gan goodly on hir se,  
That never his look ne bleynte from hir face,  
And seyde, “O dere herte, may it be  
That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?”  
“Ye, herte myn, God thank I of his grace!”  
Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste.  
That where his spirit was, for joye he niste.

This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two  
Gan for to kisse, and seyde, “O eyen clere,  
Ye be the cause of alle that me is smerte;  
Ye double wepnes of my lady dere!  
Though mercy seeme to be writen here,  
The text, forsooth, is ful hard for me to finde:  
How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?”

Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take,  
And wel an hundred tymes gan he syke;  
Nought swich sorrowful sykes as men make  
For wo, or when that folk ben sicke;  
But esy sykes, swiche as been to lyke,  
That shewed his affeccioun with-inne;  
Of swiche sykes coude he nought bilinne.

Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges,  
As fil to purpos of this aventure,  
And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,  
Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;  
But wel I woot a broche, gold and asure,  
In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte,  
Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.

Lord, trowe ye, a covetous, a wrecche,  
That blameth love and holt of it despit,  
That, of tho pens that he can moke and keche,  
Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delit,  
As is in love, in o poynt, in som plyt?  
Nay, doutelees, for also God me save,  
So parfit joye may no nigard have!

They wol seye “Yis,” but lord! so that they lye,  
Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!  
They callen love a woodnesse or folye.  
But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;  
They shul forgo the white and eke the rede,  
And live in wo, ther God yeve hem mischaunce,  
And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!

As wolde God, tho wrecches that despyse  
Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe  
As hadde Myda, ful of covetise,  
And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge  
As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge,  
To techen hem that they ben in the vyce,  
And lovers nought, al-though they holde hem nyce!

Thise like two, of whom that I yow seye,  
Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,  
Tho gonne they to speken and to pleyen,  
And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where.  
They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere  
That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,  
I thanke it God, was turned to gladnesse.

And evermo, whan that hem fel to speke  
Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon,  
With kissing al that tale sholde breke,  
And fallen in a newe joye anoon,  
And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,  
For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,  
And passed wo with joye counterpeyse.

Reson wil not that I speke of sleep;  
For it accordeth nought to my matere;  
God wot, they toke of that ful litel keep,  
But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,  
Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere,  
It was biset in joye and bisinesse  
Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse.

But whan the cok, comune astrologer,  
Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe,  
And Lucifer, the dayes messager,  
Gan for to rise, and out hir bemes throwe;  
And estward roos, to him that coude it knowe,  
Fortuna maiour, than anoon Criseyde,  
With herte sore, to Troilus thus seyde:—

“Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce,  
That I was born, alais! what me is wo,  
That day of us mot make desseveraunce!  
For tyme it is to rise, and hennes go.  
Or elles I am lost for evermo!  
O night, alais! why niltow over us hove,  
As longe as whan Almena lay by Jove?

O blake night, as folk in bokes rede,  
That shapen art by God this world to hyde  
At certein tymes with thy derke wede,  
That under that men might in reste abyde,  
We oghte bestes pleyne, and folk thee chyde,  
That there-as day with labour wol be us breste,  
That thou thus fleest, and deynest us nought reste!

Thou dost, alais! to shortly thyn office,  
Thou rakel night, ther God, makere of kinde,  
Thee, for thyn hast and thyn unkind office,  
So faste ay to our hemisphere binde,  
That never-more under the ground thou winde!  
For now, for thou so hyest out of Troye,  
Have I forgon thus hastily my joye!”

This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,  
As thoughte him tho, for piteous distresse,  
The blody teres from his herte melte,  
As he that never yet swich hevinesse  
Assayed hadde, out of so grete gladnesse,  
Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere  
In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere:—

“O cruel day, accusour of the joye  
That night and love han stole and faste ywryen,  
Acursed be thy coming in-to Troye,  
For every bore hath oon of thy bright yen!  
Envious day, what list thee so to spyen?  
What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,  
Ther God thy light so quenche, for his grace?

Allas! what han thise loveres thee agilt,  
Dispitous day? thyn be the pyne of helle!  
For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;  
Thy pouring in wol no-where lete hem dwelle.  
What proferestow thy light here for to selle?  
Go selle it hem that smale sceles graven;  
We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.”

And eke the sonne Titan gan he chyde,  
And seyde, “O fool, wel may men thee despise,  
That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde,  
And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse,  
For to disenesen lovers in this wise;  
What! holde thy bed ther, thou, and eek thy morwe!  
I biddeth God, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!”

Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde,  
“My lady right, and of my wele or wo  
The welle and rote, O goodly myn, Criseyde,  
And shal I rise, alais! and shal I go?  
Now fele I that myn herte moot a-two!  
For how sholde I my lyf an houre save,  
Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have?

What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,  
Ne whanne, alais! I shal the tyme see  
That in this pleyt I may be eft with yow;  
And of my lyf, God woot how that shal be,  
Sin that desyr right now so byteth me,  
That I am deed anoon, but I retourne.  
How sholde I longe, alais! fro you sojourn?

But natheles, myn owene lady bright,  
Yit were it so that I wiste outrely,  
That I, your humble servaunt and your knight,  
Were in your herte set so fermely  
As ye in myn, the which thing, trewely,  
Me lever were than these worldes tweine,  
Yet sholde I bet endure al my peyne.

To that Criseyde answerde right anoon,  
And with a syk she seyde, “O herte dere,  
The game, ywis, so ferforth now is goon,  
That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,  
And every eagle been the doves fere,  
And every roche out of his place sterte,  
Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!

Ye be so depe in with myn herte grave,  
That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought,  
As wisely verray God my soule save,  
To dyen in the peine, I coude nought!  
And for the love of God that us hath wrought,  
Lat in your brain non other fantasye  
So crepe, that it cause me to dye!

And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde  
As I have yow, that wolde I yow biseche;  
And, if I wiste soothly that to finde,  
God mighte not a poynt my joyes eche!  
But, herte myn, withouten more speche,  
Beth to me trewe, or elles were it routhe;  
For I am thyn, by God and by my trouthe!

Beth glad forthy, and live in sikemesse;  
Thus seyde I never er this, ne shal to mo;  
And if to yow it were a greet gladnesse  
To turne ayein, soone after that ye go,  
As fayn wolde I as ye, it were so,  
As wysly God myn herte bringe at reste!”  
And him in armes took, and ofte keste.

Agains his wil, sin it moot nedes be.  
This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,  
And in his armes took his lady free  
An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde,  
And with swich wordes as his herte bledde  
He seyde, “Farewel, my dere herte swete,  
Ther God us graunte sounde and sone to mete!”

To which no word for sorwe she answerde;  
So sore gan his parting hir destreyne;  
And Troilus unto his palays ferde,  
As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;  
So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne  
For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,  
That it may never out of his remembraunce.

Retorned to his royal palais, sone  
He softe into his bed gan for to slinke,  
To slepe longe, as he was wont to doon.  
But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,  
But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke;  
Thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende,  
A thousandfold was worth more than he wende.

And in his thought gan up and doun to winde  
Hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce,  
And fermely impressen in his minde  
The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce;  
And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce,  
Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede  
Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.

Criseyde also, right in the same wise,  
Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette  
His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse,  
His gentilesse, and how she with him mette,  
Thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette;  
Desyring eft to have hir herte dere  
In swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere.

Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was  
Unto his nece, and gan hir fayre grete,  
Seyde, “Al this night so reyned it, alais!  
That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,  
Han litel layser had to slepe and mete;  
Al night,” quod he, “hath reyn so do me wake,  
That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.”

And ner he com, and seyde, “How stant it now  
This mery morwe, nece, how kan ye fare?”  
Criseyde answerde, “Never the bet for yow.  
Fox that ye been, God yeve your herte care!  
God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare.  
Trow I,” quod she, “for alle your wordes whyte;  
O! who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!”

Criseyde strove her blushing face to hide  
Behind the bed, and grew for shame al red;  
But Pandare underneath the bedclothes pried,  
“Dere Criseyde, if I must dye,” he seyde,  
“Have here a swerd and smite off my poore hede!”  
He thrust his arm beneath her nek to twiste,  
The coveres of, and eft his nece he kiste.

No more of this: such mirth as hem befell,  
If God forgaf his dethe, she sholde nat let  
Hir uncle harmless be; and thus they whilede  
The time in freendly blis and muche quiete,  
Til at the last she to her house wente,  
And left her uncle at his ease ful fayn.

Pandare, that by Troilus was sent a-rowe,  
Came to his lord; and after greet greeting,  
Upon his bed he sat him doun to rove,  
And Troilus, that lay til that same thing,  
Namely the joy which Pandare did bring,  
Fell on his knees and thanked him ful ofte,  
And blessed him that his heviness he softe.

“O friend,” quod he, “of friends the very beste  
That ever was or ever was herd tell,  
Thou hast in hevene brought my soule to reste  
From Phlegethon, the fiery flood of hell;  
A thousand tyme a day if I wol sell  
My-self to serve and honour only thee,  
It wol nat be ymuch; thy thank is me.”

“The sun, that moveth in his course upright,  
Saw never yet, this dare I wel avowe,  
A fairer than my lady dere and bright;  
And to my deeth I shal be bounden now  
To her; the thank for al this I allow  
To Love, and eke to thee, my Pandare dere,  
For thy wise labour which me brought out of fere.”

### Modern English

“And me bistowed in so high a place  
That thilke boundes may no blissé pace,  
I can no more, but laude and reverence  
Be to thy bounte and thy excellence!”

And therewithal Criseyde anon he kist,  
Of which, certain, she felt no disese.

And thus said he, “Now would God I knew,  
My heart’s sweet, how I might please you!  
What man,” said he, “was ever thus at ease  
As I, on whom the fairest and the best  
That ever I saw deigns her heart to rest?

Here may men see that mercy passes right;  
The experience of that is felt in me,  
That am unworthy to so sweet a wight.  
But heart of mine, of your benignity  
So thinketh, though that I unworthy be,  
Yet must I needs amend in some wise,  
Right through the virtue of your high service.

And for the love of God, my lady dear,  
Since God hath wrought me that I shall you serve,  
As thus I mean, that ye will be my steer;  
To do me live, if that you list, or sterve.  
So teach me how that I may deserve  
Your thanks, so that I, through my ignorance,  
Do nothing that you be displeased.

For certes, fresh womanlike wife,  
This dare I say, that truth and diligence  
That shall ye find in me all my life;  
Nor will I not, certain, break your defence;  
And if I do, present or in absence,  
For love of God, let slay me with the dead,  
If that it please unto your womanhead.”

“Y-wis,” said she, “my own heart’s delight,  
My ground of ease, and all my heart’s dear,  
Grant mercy, for on that I build my trust;  
But let us fall away from this matter;  
For it sufficeth, this that here is said.  
And at one word, without repentance,  
Welcome, my knight, my peace, my sufficiency!”

Of her delight or joys, one least of them,  
Were impossible for my wit to tell;  
But judge, ye that have been at such a feast  
Of such gladness, if that it please you play!  
I can no more, but thus these same twain  
That night, betwixt dread and sickness,  
Felt in love the great worthiness.

O blissful night, of them so long sought,  
How blithe unto them both you were!  
Why had I such a one with my soul bought,  
Yea, or the least joy that was there?  
Away, thou foul danger and thou fear,  
And let them in this heaven-bliss dwell,  
That is so high, that all I cannot tell!

But truth is, though I cannot tell all,  
As can my author, of his excellence.  
Yet have I said, and, God before, I shall  
In everything wholly his sentence.  
And if I, at love’s reverence,  
Have any word that errs toward the best,  
Do therewithal right as yourselves think best.

For all my words, here and in every part,  
I speak them all under correction  
Of you that have feeling in love’s art.  
And put it all in your discretion  
To increase or make diminution  
Of my language, and that I you beseech;  
But now to purpose of my rather speech.

These same two, that lie yet in arms,  
So loath were they to part, it seemed,  
That each from other feared to be bereft,  
Or else—lo—this was their greatest fear,  
That all this thing were but nice dreams;  
For which full often each of them said, “O sweet,  
Cling I to you thus, or else I taste it?”

And, Lord! so he began to gaze upon her,  
That never his look averted from her face,  
And said, “O dear heart, may it be true  
That it is sooth that you are in this place?”  
“Yes, heart of mine, God thank I of his grace!”  
Quoth then Criseyde, and therewithal him kissed.  
Where was his spirit, for joy he knew not.

This Troilus full often her two eyes  
Began to kiss, and said, “O eyes so clear,  
Ye be the cause of all that me is smart;  
Ye double weapons of my lady dear!  
Though mercy seem to be writ here,  
The text, forsooth, is full hard for me to find:  
How could you without bonds me bind?”

Therewith he took her fast into his arms,  
And well an hundred times he sighed;  
Not such sorrowful sighs as men make  
For woe, or when folk are sick;  
But easy sighs, such as please,  
That showed his affection within;  
Of such sighs could he not refrain.

Soon after this they spoke of sundry things,  
As fell to purpose of this adventure,  
And playing exchanged their rings,  
Of which I can not tell a scripture;  
But well I wot a brooch, gold and azure,  
In which a ruby set was like a heart,  
Criseyde him gave, and stuck it on his shirt.

Lord! believe you, a covetous wretch,  
That blames love and holds it in despite,  
That, of those pens that he can mock and catch,  
Was ever yet given such delight,  
As is in love, in one point, in some play?  
Nay, doubtless, so help me God,  
So perfect joy may no niggard have!

They will say “Yes,” but, Lord! so that they lie,  
Those busy wretches, full of woe and dread!  
They call love madness or folly.  
But it shall befall them as I shall you read:  
They shall forgo the white and also the red,  
And live in woe—there God give them mischance—  
And every lover in his truth advance!

As would God those wretches that despise  
Service of love had ears as long  
As had Midas, full of covetousness;  
And thereto drunken had as hot and strong  
As Crassus drank for his wrongful acts,  
To teach them that they are in the vice,  
And not lovers, although they hold them nice!

These like two, of whom that I you tell,  
When that their hearts well assured were,  
Then began they to speak and also to play,  
And eke rehearse how, and when, and where.  
They knew each other first, and every woe and fear  
That passed was; but all such heaviness,  
I thank God, was turned to gladness.

And evermore, when it befell them to speak  
Of anything of such a time ago,  
With kissing all that tale they would break,  
And fall into a new joy anon,  
And did all their might, since they were one,  
To recover bliss and be at ease,  
And past woe with joy to counterpoise.

You’ll scarce expect that I should speak of sleep;  
The topic seems, indeed, not pertinent.  
God wot, they took but little keeping of that,  
But lest this night, that was to them so dear,  
Should in vain escape in no manner,  
It was busied in joy and busyness  
Of all that soundeth into gentleness.

But when the cock, common astrologer,  
Gan on his breast to beat, and after crow,  
And Lucifer, the day’s messenger,  
Began to rise and forth his beams to throw;  
And eastward rose, to him that could it know,  
Fortuna maiour—then anon Criseyde,  
With heart sore, to Troilus thus said:—

“My heart’s life, my trust and my pleasure,  
That I was born, alas! what me is woe,  
That day of us must make disseverance!  
For time it is to rise, and hence go.  
Or else I am lost for evermore!  
O night, alas! why wilt thou not hover o’er us,  
As long as when Alcmena lay by Jove?

O black night, as folk in books read,  
That art made by God this world to hide  
At certain times with thy dark weed,  
That under thee men might in rest abide,  
We shoulden beasts bemoan, and folk thee chide,  
That where-as day with labour will us press,  
Thou thus fleest, and deignest us no rest!

Thou dost, alas! thy office too shortly,  
Thou heedless night, thy maker of mankind  
Curse thee for thy haste and unkind device,  
So fast aye to our hemisphere bind,  
That never-more under the ground thou wind!  
For now, because thou so hast risen out of Troy,  
Have I thus hastily forgone my joy!”

This Troilus, that with those words felt  
As seemed to him then, for piteous distress,  
The bloody tears from his heart did melt,  
As he that never yet such heaviness  
Assayed had, out of so great gladness,  
He therewithal Criseyde his lady dear  
In arms embraced, and said in this manner:—

“O cruel day, accuser of the joy  
That night and love have stolen and fast written,  
Accursed be thy coming into Troy,  
For every boar hath one of thy bright eyes!  
Envious day, what list thee so to spy?  
What hast thou lost, why seekest thou this place,  
Where God thy light so quench for his grace?

Alas! what have these lovers thee agilt,  
Invidious day? Thine be the pain of hell!  
For many a lover hast thou shent, and wilt;  
Thy pouring in will nowhere let them dwell.  
What profferest thou thy light here to sell?  
Go sell it them that small seals engrave;  
We will thee nought, we need no day haven.”

And eke the sun Titan gan he chide,  
And said, “O fool, well may men thee despise,  
That hast the Dawning all night at thy side,  
And suffrest her so soon up from thee rise,  
For to dis-ease lovers in this wise;  
What! hold thy bed there, thou, and eke thy morrow!  
I bid God, so give you both sorrow!”

Therewith full sore he sighed, and thus he said,  
“My lady right, and of my weal and woe  
The well and root, O goodly mine, Criseyde,  
And shall I rise, alas! and shall I go?  
Now feel I that my heart must be asunder!  
For how should I my life an hour save,  
Since that with you is all the life I have?

What shall I do, for certes, I not how,  
Nor when, alas! I shall the time see  
That in this plight I may be eft with you;  
And of my life, God wot how that shall be,  
Since that desire right now so biteth me,  
That I am dead anon, but I returne.  
How should I long, alas! from you sojourn?

But nevertheless, my own lady bright,  
Yet were it so that I wist utterly,  
That I, your humble servant and your knight,  
Were in your heart set so firmly  
As ye in mine,—which thing, truly,  
Me were more dear than these worldes twain,  
Yet should I better endure all my pain.”

To that Criseyde answered right anon,  
And with a sigh she said, “O heart dear,  
The game, y-wis, so far forth now is gone,  
That first shall Phoebus fall from out his sphere,  
And every eagle be the dove’s peer,  
And every rock out of his place start,  
Ere Troilus out of Criseyde’s heart!

Ye be so deep engraved in my heart,  
That, though I would it turn out of my thought,  
As truly, verily, God my soul save,  
To die in the pain, I could not!  
And for the love of God that us hath wrought,  
Let in your brain no other fantasy  
So creep, that it cause me to die!

And that ye me would have as fast in mind  
As I have you, that would I you beseech;  
And, if I wist soothly to find that,  
God might not a point my joys eclipse!  
But, heart of mine, withouten more speech,  
Be thou to me true, or else were it pity;  
For I am thine, by God and by my troth!

Be glad therefore, and live in sickness;  
Thus said I never ere this, nor shall to more;  
And if to you it were a great gladness  
To turn again, soon after that ye go,  
As fain would I as ye, it were so,  
As truly God my heart bring at rest!”  
And him in arms she took, and often kissed.

Against his will, since it must needs be,  
This Troilus up rose, and fast him clothed,  
And in his arms took his lady free  
An hundred times, and on his way him sped,  
And with such words as his heart bled  
He said, “Farewell, my dear heart sweet,  
There God us grant sound and soon to meet!”

To which no word for sorrow she answered;  
So sore began his parting her constrain;  
And Troilus unto his palace fared,  
As woe-begone as she was, sooth to say;  
So hard him wrong of sharp desire the pain  
To be again where he was in pleasure,  
That it may never out of his remembrance.

Returned to his royal palace, soon  
He softly into his bed began to slink,  
To sleep long, as he was wont to do.  
But all for nought; he may well lie and wink,  
But sleep ne may there in his heart sink;  
Thinking how she, for whom desire him brent,  
A thousandfold was worth more than he thought.

And in his thought began up and down to wind  
Her words all, and every countenance,  
And firmly impress in his mind  
The least point that to him was pleasure;  
And verily, of that remembrance,  
Desire all new him burned, and lust to breed  
Began more than erst, and yet took he none heed.

Criseyde also, right in the same wise,  
Of Troilus began in her heart to set  
His worthiness, his lust, his deeds’ wise,  
His gentleness, and how she with him met,  
Thanking love that so well her beset;  
Desiring again to have her heart dear  
In such a plight, she dared to make him cheer.

Pandare, a-morrow that had come at last,  
Unto his niece, and gan her fair greet,  
Said, “All this night so rained it, alas!  
That all my dread is that ye, niece sweet,  
Have little leisure had to sleep and eat;  
All night,” quoth he, “hath rain so do me wake,  
That some of us, I trow, our heads ache.”

And near he came, and said, “How standeth it now  
This merry morn, niece, how can ye fare?”  
Criseyde answered, “Never the better for you.  
Fox that ye be, God give your heart care!  
God help me so, ye caused all this fare.  
I trow,” quoth she, “for all your words so white;  
O! who-so seeth you knoweth you full little!”

Criseyde strove her blushing face to hide  
Behind the bed, and grew for shame all red;  
But Pandare underneath the bedclothes pried,  
“Dear Criseyde, if I must die,” he said,  
“Have here a sword and smite off my poor head!”  
He thrust his arm beneath her neck to twist,  
The covers off, and then his niece he kissed.

No need to tell how they were reconciled.  
If God forgave his death, then should not she  
Forgive her uncle? Thus the time they whiled  
Away in great amicability,  
As good friends now as any man could be,  
Till in good time to her own house she went,  
And left her uncle very well content.

To Troilus let us now turn again,  
Who long abed in wakeful tossing lay;  
For Pandare soon he sent some of his men  
To bid him hasten thither right away,  
And Pandare came without a nay,  
And greeting him in manner dignified,  
Upon his bed he sat down at his side.

And Troilus, moved by the deep affection  
Which for his friend within his heart now lies,  
Fell on his knees in absolute subjection,  
Nor from that humble place would he arise,  
But thanked with grateful thanks multiplied,  
A thousand times, and oft the day did bless  
That such a friend was born to save him from distress.

“O friend,” he said, “of friends the very best  
That ever was or ever was heard tell,  
Thou hast in heaven brought my soul to rest  
From Phlegethon, the fiery flood of hell;  
A thousand times a day if I should sell  
Myself to serve and honour only thee,  
Enough reward and pay it would not be.

“The sun, which moves above in all man’s sight,  
Saw never yet, this dare I well aver,  
A fairer than my dearest lady bright,  
And to my death I shall be bound to her;  
The thanks for all this favour I refer  
To Love, who honours me with kind assistance,  
And also, Pandare, to thy wise persistence.

“What thou hast given is no little thing,  
And I shall pay thee thanks forever and aye!  
And why? Because thy faithful help did bring  
Me back to life, who else were dead this day”—  
And then upon his bed again he lay.

Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,  
In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone  
He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,  
And sette him there-as he was wont to done;  
And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,  
For love of god, to don that reverence,  
To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience.

11

Thanne seyde he thus, “lo! lordes myne, I was  
Trojan, as it is knowen out of drede;  
And if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,  
That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,  
And tolde wel how that ye sholden spedc.  
For dredelees, thorugh yow, shal, in a stounde,  
Ben Troye y-brend, and beten doun to grounde.

12

And in what forme, or in what maner wyse  
This town to shende, and al your lust to acheve,  
Ye han er this wel herd it me devyse;  
This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.  
And for the Grekes weren me so leve,  
I com my-self in my propre persone,  
To teche in this how yow was best to done;

13

Havinge un-to my tresour ne my rente  
Right no resport, to respect of your ese.  
Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente,  
Wening in this you, lordes, for to plesc.  
But al that lose ne doth me no disese.  
Vouche-sauf, as wisly have I joye,  
Or you to lese al that I have in Troye,

14

Save of a doughter, that I lafte, alias!  
Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte.  
O steme, O cruel fader that I was!  
How mighte I have in that so hard an herte?  
Allas! I ne hadde y-brought hir in hir sherte!  
For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe,  
But-if ye lordes rewe up-on my sorwe.

15

For, by that cause I say no tyme er now  
Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees;  
But now or never, if that it lyke yow,  
I may hir have right sone, doutelees.  
O help and grace! amonges al this prees,  
Rewe on this olde caitif in destresse,  
Sin I through yow have al this hevinesse!

16

Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun  
Trojans y-nowe; and if your willes be,  
My child with oon may have redempeioun.  
Now for the love of god and of bountee,  
Oon of so fele, alias! so yeve him me.  
What nede were it this preyere for to werne,  
Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne?

17

On peril of my lyf, I shal not lye,  
Appollo hath me told it feithfully;  
I have chek founde it by astronomye.  
By sort, and by augurie eek trewely,  
And dar wel seye, the tyme is faste by,  
That fyrn and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede;  
And thus shal Troye turne in asshen dede.

18

For certeyn, Phebus and Neptunus bothe,  
That makeden the walles of the toun,  
Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe,  
That thei wol bringe it to confusioun,  
Right in despyt of king Lamcaudoun,  
By-cause he nolde payen hem hir hyre.  
“The toun of Troye shal ben set on-fyre.”

19

Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,  
Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,  
The salte teres from his eyen tweye  
Ful faste ronnen doun by eyther cheke.  
So longe he gan of socour hem by-seke  
That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore,  
They yave him Antenor, with-oute more.

20

But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho?  
And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde  
On hem that sholden for the tretis go.  
And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde  
To brigen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;  
And whan Pryam his save-garde sente,  
Th’embassadours to Troye streyght they wente.

21

The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde  
Pryam the king ful sone in general  
Let here-upon his parlement to holde.  
Of which the effect rehersen yow I shal.  
Th’embassadours ben answered for fynal,  
Th’eschaunge of prisoners and al this nede  
Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede.

22

This Troilus was present in the place,  
Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,  
For which ful sone chaungen gan his face,  
As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde.  
But nathelees, he no word to it seyed,  
Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye;  
With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye.

23

And ful of anguish and of grisly drede  
Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye;  
And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede,  
Th’eschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye.  
First, how to save hir honour, and what weye  
He might best th’eschaunge of hir withstonde;  
Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde.

24

Love him made al prest to doon hir byde,  
And rather dye than she sholde go;  
But resoun seyde him, on that other syde,  
“With-oute assent of hir ne do not so,  
Lest for thy werk she wolde by thy fo  
And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe  
Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.”

25

For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,  
That though the lordes wolde that she wente,  
He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste,  
And telle his lady first what that they mente;  
And whan that she had sayd him hir entente,  
Ther-aftre wolde he werken also blyve,  
Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve.

26

Ector, which that we the Grekes herde,  
For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,  
Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde:—  
“Sires, she nis no prisoner,” he seyde;  
“I noot on yow who that this charge leyde.  
But, on my part, ye may eft-sone him telle,  
We usen here no wommen for to selle.”

27

The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones,  
As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre;  
For infortune it wolde, for the nones,  
They sholden hir confusioun desyre.  
“Ector,” quod they, “what goost may yow enspyre,  
This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese  
Daun Antenor?—a wrong wey now ye chese—

28

That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun,  
And we han nede of folk, as men may see;  
He is eek oon, the grettest of this toun;  
O Ector, lat tho fantasys be!  
O king Pryam,” quod they, “thus seggen we,  
That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde”;  
And to deliveren Antenor they preyde.

29

O Juvenal, lord! trewe is thy sentence,  
That litel witen folk what is to yerne  
That they ne finde in hir desyr offence;  
For cloud of errour lat hem not descerne  
What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.  
This folk desiren now deliveraunce  
Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!

30

For he was after traytour to the toun  
Of Troye; alias! they quitte him out to rathe;  
O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun!  
Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,  
Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;  
But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,  
And she shal out: thus seyden here and howne.

31

For which delibered was by parlement,  
For Antenor to yelden up Criseyde,  
And it pronounced by the president,  
Al-though that Ector “nay” ful ofte preyde.  
And fynaly, what wight that it withseyde,  
It was for nought; it moste been, and sholde;  
For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.

32

Departed out of parlement echone.  
This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo,  
Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,  
But-if it were a man of his or two,  
The whiche he bad out faste for to go,  
By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde,  
And hastely up-on his bed him leyde.

33

And as in winter leves been biraft,  
Eche after other, til the tree be bare,  
So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft,  
Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare,  
Y-bounden in the blake bark of care,  
Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde,  
So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.

34

He rist him up, and every dore he shette,  
And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man  
Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette,  
Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan;  
And in his brest the heped wo bigan  
Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse  
In his woodnesse, as I shal you devyse.

35

Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe,  
Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte,  
And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge,  
Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte,  
Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte;  
His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde  
Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde.

36

His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,  
Out stremeden as swifte wells tweye;  
The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte  
His speche him rafte, unnethes mighte he seye,  
“O deeth, alias! why niltow do me deye?  
A-cursed be the day which that nature  
Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!”

37

But after, whan the furie and the rage  
Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,  
By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage,  
Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste;  
But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste,  
That wonder is, the body may suffyse  
To half this wo, which that I yow devyse.

38

Than seyde he thus, “Fortune! alias the while!  
What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt?  
How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle?  
Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?  
Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?  
Allas! how maystow in thyn herte finde  
To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?

39

Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve,  
As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle?  
Why wiltow me fro joye thus depryve?  
O Troilus, what may men now thee calle  
But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle  
In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle  
Criseyde, alias! til that the breeth me fayle?

40

Allas, Fortune! if that my lyf in joye  
Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye,  
Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye,  
By-raft the lyf, or doon my bretheren dye,  
Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye,  
I cumber-world, that may of no-thing serve,  
But ever dye, and never fully sterve?

41

If that Criseyde allone were me laft,  
Nought roughte I whider thou woldest me stere;  
And hir, alias! than hastow me biraft.  
But ever-more, lo! this is thy manere,  
To reve a wight that most is to him dere,  
To preve in that thy gerful violence.  
Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence.

42

O verray lord of love, O god, alias!  
That knowest best myn herte and al my thought,  
What shal my sorwful lyf don in this cas  
If I for-go that I so dere have bought?  
Sin ye Criseyde and me han fully brought  
In-to your grace, and bothe our hertes seled,  
How may ye suffre, alias! it be repeled?

43

What I may doon, I shal, whyl I may dure  
On lyve in torment and in cruel peyne.  
This infortune or this disaventure,  
Allone as I was bom, y-wis, compleyne;  
Ne never wil I seen it shyne or reyne;  
But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse  
My sorwful lyf, and dyen in distresse.

44

O wery goost, that errest to and fro,  
Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste  
Body, that ever mighte on grounde go?  
O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste,  
Flee forth out of myn herte, and lat it breste,  
And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere;  
Thy righte place is now no lenger here!

45

O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport  
Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte,  
What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort,  
Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte?  
Sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte,  
In veyn fro-this-forth have I eyen tweye  
Y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye.

46

O my Criseyde, O lady sovereyne  
Of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth,  
Who shal now yeven comfort to my peyne?  
Allas, no wight; but when myn herte dyeth,  
My spirit, which that so un-to yow hyeth,  
Receyve in gree, for that shal ay yow serve;  
For-thy no fors is, though the body sterve.

47

O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel  
Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure,  
God leve that ye finde ay love of steel.  
And longe mot your lyf in joye endure!  
But whan ye comen by my sepulture,  
Remembreth that your felawe resteth there;  
For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were.

48

O olde unholsom and mislyved man,  
Calkas I mene, alias! what eyleth thee  
To been a Greek, sin thou art bom Trojan?

49

O Calchas! which that wilt my banc be,  
In cursed tyme was thou born for me!  
As wolde blisful Jove, for his joye,  
That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!

50

A thousand sykes, hottere than the glede,  
Out of his brest ech after other wente,  
Medled with pleyntes newe, his wo to fede,  
For which his woful teres never stente;  
And shortly, so his peynes him to-rente,  
And wex so mat, that joye nor penaunce  
He feleth noon, but lyth forth in a traunce.

51

Pandare, which that in the parlement  
Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde,  
And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,  
For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,  
Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breyde,  
So that, for wo, he niste what he mente;  
But in a rees to Troilus he wente.

52

A certeyn knight, that for the tyme kepte  
The chaumbre-dore, un-dide it him anoon;  
And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,  
In-to the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,  
Toward the bed gan softely to goon,  
So confus, that he niste what to seye;  
For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.

53

And with his chere and loking al to-torn,  
For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,  
He stood this woful Troilus bifom,  
And on his pitous face he gan biholden;  
But lord, so often gan his herte colden,  
Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse  
His herte slow, as thoughte him for distresse.

54

This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte  
His freend Pandare y-comen him to see,  
Gan as the snow ayein the sonne melte,  
For which this sorwful Pandare, of pitee,  
Gan for to wepe as tendreliche as he;  
And specheles thus been thise ilke tweye,  
That neyther mighte o word for sorwe seye.

55

But at the laste this woful Troilus,  
Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore,  
And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus,  
Among his sobbes and his sykes sore,  
“Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more.  
Hastow nought herd at parlement,” he seyde,  
“For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?”

56

This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,  
Ful pitously answerde and seyde, “yis!  
As wisly were it fals as it is trewe,  
That I have herd, and wot al how it is.  
O mercy, god, who wolde have trowed this?  
Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe,  
Fortune our joye wolde han over-throwe?

For in this world ther is no creature,

# TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

## BOOK IV

### Modern English (cleaned)

    For she had set her heart and mind
    On Troilus long since, so firm and fast,
    That all the world her love might not unbind,
    Or Troilus from out her bosom cast,
    For she was his, as long as life shall last.
    And thus distracted both by love and terror,
    She scarce could tell the truth apart from error.

    It is the common custom in each land
    For ladies to indulge in calls polite,
    And now there came to Cressida a band,
    Both glad and sad, as seemed to them but right;
    And with their gossipings unwelcome quite,
    These ladies, who in hapless Troy did dwell,
    They sat them down and said as I shall tell.

    “O, I’m so glad,” one of them cried aloud,
    “That now your father you so soon shall see!”
    Another said, “Indeed, so am not I,
    For all too little now in Troy she’ll be!”
    “Indeed I hope,” the third one said, “that she
    Shall bring us happy peace on every side,
    And when she goes, may heaven by her guide!”

    These words, and other female blandishments,
    She hears, but in her thoughts they have no share;
    Another picture quite her heart presents,
    Although in body she is sitting there.
    God knows her thought and mind are placed elsewhere,
    And Troilus alone her spirit sought,
    For whom she had no words, but all her thought.

    These ladies, with no wish but how to please,
    Their breath in idle gossiping expend,
    Wherein poor Cressida can find no ease,
    Nor with her burning heart thereto attend
    Scarce long enough a courteous ear to lend;
    She felt that she was ready to expire,
    With all this talk that doth her bore and tire.

    And in the end she might no more restrain
    Her tears, for upward they began to well
    As signs of all the inward bitter pain
    In which her wretched spirit now must dwell,
    Reflecting from what heaven to what hell
    She fallen was, since she hath lost the joy
    That she had known with Troilus in Troy.

    And all the silly fools that sat about
    Supposed she wept and sighed so long and sore,
    Because from Troy she soon must now set out
    And their society enjoy no more;
    And all the ladies there, almost a score,
    They saw her weep, and loved her tender heart,
    And in the weeping all of them took part.

    And all endeavored with her to condole.
    But little knew they of the things she thought,
    Or what alone could cheer her and console;
    And to be glad they often her besought,
    Which to her grief such mitigation brought
    As for a splitting headache one might feel
    If one were kindly rubbed upon the heel.

    When they had said all they could think to say,
    They took their leave and home departed all,
    And Cressida, oppressed with sad dismay,
    Into her chamber went from out the hall,
    And like one dead, upon her bed doth fall,
    Borne down by all this heavy weight of grief,
    From which she saw no prospect of relief.

    The bitter tears from out her eyes down pour,
    Like April showers falling full and fast;
    Her breast so white she beat, and evermore
    She called on death to take her at the last,
    Such heavy sorrow now her soul harassed,
    Her lover lost, who was her only hope,
    Forlorn in black despair so left to grope.

    Her rippling hair, as golden as the sun,
    She tore, and wrung her hands with fingers small,
    But no relief from sorrow thus she won,
    Nor yet from death, on whom she oft doth call;
    Her hue, so bright, lay hidden neath a pall,
    In testimony of this hard distraint,
    And thus with sobs she uttered this sad plaint:

    “Alas, sent forth from out my home and nation,
    I, woful wretch, bereft of all delight,
    And born beneath a cursed constellation,
    Must now depart from my beloved’s sight!
    Woe worth the day, and specially the night,
    When first I saw him with my eyes so plain,
    Who causes me, as I cause him, such pain!

    “What shall he do? And what indeed shall I?
    How shall I now my life anew begin?
    And O, dear heart, for whom I’d gladly die,
    Who shall relieve the sorrow you are in?
    O Calchas, father, thine is all this sin!
    I curse the day my mother dear, Argive,
    Brought me into this wretched world alive!

    “To what end should I live and sorrow thus?
    How should a fish without water dure?
    What is Cressida worth, from Troilus?
    How should a plant or living creature
    Live without his kinde noriture?
    For which full oft a by-word here I say,
    That, ‘Toteless, must green things soon decay.’

    “I shall do thus, since neither sword nor dart
    Dare I handle, for the cruelty
    That ilke day that I from you depart,
    If sorrow of that nil not be my bane,
    Then shall no meat or drink come in to me
    Till I my soul out of my breast unsheathe;
    And thus myself I will I do to death.

    “And, Troilus, my clothes everichone
    Shall black be, in tokening, heart-sweet,
    That I am as out of this world agone.
    That wont was you to setten in quiet;
    And of mine order, ay till death me mete,
    The observance ever, in your absence,
    Shall sorrow be, complaint, and abstinence.

    “My heart and eke the woeful ghost therein
    Bequeathe I, with your spirit, to complain
    Eternally, for they shall never twine;
    For though in earth y-twinned be we twain,
    Yet in the field of pity, out of pain,
    That hight *Elysos*, shall we be y-fere,
    As Orpheus and Eurydice his fere.

    “Thus, heart of mine, for Antenor, alas!
    I soon shall be changed, as I ween.
    But how shall ye do in this sorrowful case?
    How shall your tender heart this susteine?
    But heart of mine, forget this sorrow and tene,
    And me also; for, soothly for to say,
    So ye well fare, I reck not to die.”

    Who might, as I cannot, the tale have sung
    Which plaintively she made of her distress?
    But as for me, my little tongue,
    If I described would her heaviness,
    It should make her sorrow seem less
    Than that it was, and childishly deface
    Her high complaint, and therefore I it pass.

    Pandar, which that sent from Troilus
    Was to Cressida, as ye have heard devise,
    That for the best it was accorded thus,
    And he full glad to do him that service,
    Unto Cressida, in a full secret wise,
    There as she lay in torment and in rage,
    Came her to tell al wholly his message.

    And found that she herself began to treat
    Full pitifully; for with her sake
    Her breast, her face was bathed full wet;
    The mighty tresses of her sonnish hairs
    About her ears, escaped from out its braid,
    Undoubted signal of the martyrdom
    Of death, which none too soon for her may come.

    At sight of him, she strove for shame anon
    Her tearful face behind her arms to hide,
    At which good Pandar was so wo-begone,
    He scarcely in the chamber might abide,
    At her sad look he was so horrified;
    And now her flood of woe broke out anew
    And by release a thousandfold it grew.

    Then thus with words to sorrow she gave voice:
    “My uncle Pandar, cause of causes first
    That in the light of love I did rejoice,
    My joy to sudden woe is now reversed!
    Shouldst thou be welcomed here or be accursed,
    Who thus hast guided me in love’s emprise,
    To end, alas, in this so wretched wise!

    “Must love then end in woe? Yes, or men lie,
    And every worldly joy, it seems to me,
    For grief the place of joy must occupy!
    And he who doubts if such the end must be,
    Let him behold my grievous fate and see
    How I from bad must ever pass to worse,
    And thus am led my hateful birth to curse.

    “Who looks at me, beholdeth sorrows all,
    All pain, all torture, woe and all distress;
    I have no need on other harms to call,
    As anguish, languor, cruel bitterness,
    Discomfort, dread, and madness more and less;
    Methinks from heaven above the tears must rain
    In pity for my harsh and cruel pain.”

    “I grant, dear lady, that your lot is hard,”
    Said Pandar, “yet what do you plan to do?
    For to yourself you should have more regard,
    And not some vain and useless course pursue;
    But now I want to say a word or two—
    A message I must briefly now present
    From Troilus, whose heart with pain is rent.”

    Her face she turned to him, so deathly pale,
    It was a most distressing sight to see.
    “Alas,” she said, “can words for aught avail?
    What can my precious sweetheart say to me,
    Since we are lost through all eternity?
    Will he have news of all the tears I've shed?
    They are enough, at least that can be said.”

    Her grief exacts from her a dreadful price.
    She looks like one to her last bier consigned;
    Her face, the image once of Paradise,
    Is changed completely to another kind.
    The play, the laughter men were wont to find
    In her, and all her varied wit renewed,
    Have fled, and left her mute in solitude.

    About her eyes there stands a purple ring,
    A silent token of her grief and pain,
    That to behold it was a deadly thing,
    For which Pandar might not restrain
    The tears from his eyes that so began to rain.
    But nonetheless, as best he might, he said
    From Troilus these words to Cressida:

    “Lo, niece, I trow ye have heard all how
    The king, with other lords, for the best
    Hath made exchange of Antenor and you,
    That cause is of this sorrow and this unrest.
    But how this case doth Troilus molest,
    That may no earthly man's tongue declare;
    For very wo his wits are all aware.

    “For which we have so sorrowed, he and I,
    That unto little both it had us slain;
    But through my counsel this day, finally,
    He somewhat is from weeping now withdrawn.
    And seemeth me that he desirous fain
    With you to be all night, for to devise
    Remedy in this, if there were any wise.

    “This, short and plain, the effect of my message,
    As far forth as my wit can comprehend.
    For ye, that be of torment in such rage,
    May to no long prologue as now attend;
    And hereupon ye may answer him and send.
    And, for the love of God, my niece dear,
    So leave this woe ere Troilus be here.”

    “Great is my wo,” she said, and sighed sore,
    As she that feelth deadly sharp distresses;
    “But yet to me his sorrow is much more,
    That love him bet than he himself, I guess.
    Allas! for me hath he such heaviness?
    Can he for me so pitifully complain?
    Y-wis, this sorrow doubleth all my pain.

    “Grievous to me, God wot, is for to twine,”
    Quoth she, “but yet it harder is to me
    To see that sorrow which that he is in;
    For well I wot, it will my bane be;
    And die I will in certain,” then she said;
    “But bid him come, ere death, that thus me threateth,
    Drive out that ghost which in mine heart beteth.”

    These words said, she on her arms two
    Fell gruff, and gan to weep pitifully.
    Quoth Pandar, “Alas! why do ye so,
    Since well ye wot the time is fast at hand
    That he shall come? Arise up hastily,
    That he you not by weeping thus may find.
    But ye will have him wood out of his mind!

    “For wiste he that ye fared in this manner,
    He would himself slay; and if I wend
    To have this fare, he should not come here
    For all the good that Priam may dispense.
    For to what fun he would anoon pretend,
    That know I well; and therefore yet I say,
    So leave this sorrow, or plainly he will die.

    “Strive rather now his sorrow to relieve
    And not to magnify it, dearest niece;
    Harsh measures will not joy retrieve.
    But soft and gentle ways will bring you peace.
    What use are tears, though tears should never cease,
    And you were drowned in them? Far better sure
    Are happy means of cure than mere lament.

    “Now, my advice is, when your plans are made,
    Since ye be wise and both of one assent,
    Arrange for your departure so to evade,
    Or quick return, if that you cannot prevent.
    Women do best without long argument;
    Let’s see now what your woman's wit avails,
    And I'll be there to help when that it fails.”

    “Go then,” said Cressida, “and truly I
    Shall do my best all weeping to restrain
    While he is here, and earnestly shall try
    To make him glad, and free him of his pain,
    Through all his heart in every coursing vein.
    If any salve for him I can discover,
    I shall be found not lacking to my lover.”

    Then Pandar went, and Troilus he sought,
    And found him in a temple all alone,
    Weary of life and much in mind distraught.
    And there he prayed and made his bitter moan,
    And of his prayers this was the constant tone,
    That end of life might bring end of grief,
    For well he thought this was his sole relief.

    And in his mind, the simple truth to tell,
    He was so fallen in despair that day,
    He thought no longer in this world to dwell,
    And argued of it in the following way:
    “I am,” he said, “but done for, so to say;
    For all that comes, comes by necessity,
    Thus to be done for is my destiny.

    “I must believe and cannot other choose,
    That Providence, in its divine foresight,
    Hath known that Cressida I once must lose.
    Since God sees everything from heaven’s height
    And plans things as he thinks both best and right,
    According to their merits in rotation,
    As was arranged for by predestination.

    “But still I don't quite know what to believe!
    For there have been great scholars, many a one,
    Who say that destined fate we must receive,
    Yet others prove that this need not be done,
    And that free choice hath been denied to none.
    Alack, so sly they are, these scholars old,
    I can't make out what doctrine I should hold!

    “For some declare what God perceives before
    (And God, of course, can never be misled)
    All that must be, though men may it deplore,
    Because foreordination hath so said;
    Wherefore the thought still lingers in my head,
    That if from eternal wisdom He hath wist
    Before our thought, even as our deed,
    We have no free choice, as these clerks read.

    “For other thought nor other deed also
    Might never be but such as purveyance
    Which may not be deceived nevermore
    Hath filed before, without ignorance.
    For if there might be a variance
    To writhe out from God's purveying,
    There were no prescience of thing coming.

    “But it were rather an opinion
    Uncertain, and no stedfast foreseeing;
    And certes that were an abusio n,
    That God should have no perfect clear witing
    More than we men that have doubtful wening.
    But such an error upon God to guess
    Were false and foul, and wicked cursedness.

    “Also this is an opinion of some
    That have their top full high and smooth ashore;
    They say right thus, that thing is not to come
    For that the prescience hath seen before
    That it shall come; but they say therefore
    That it shall come, therefore the purveyance
    Wot it before withouten ignorance;
    And in this manner this necessity
    Returneth in his part contrary again.
    For needfully behooveth it not to be
    That those things fallen in certain
    That be purveyed; but needly, as they say,
    Behooveth it that things which fall,
    That they in certain be purveyed all.

    “I mean as though I labored me in this
    To inquire which thing cause of which thing be;
    As whether that the prescience of God is
    The certain cause of the necessity
    Of things that to come are purveyed, pardee;
    Or if necessity of thing coming
    Be cause certain of the purveying.

    “But now I enforce me not in shewing
    How the order of causes standeth; but well wot I
    That it behooveth that the behappening
    Of things wot before certainly
    Be necessary, albeit it not thereby
    That prescience put falling necessary
    To thing to come, all fall it foul or fair.

    “For if there sit a man yond on a sea, ...” 

### Middle English (corrected from OCR)

    For she hadde set hire herte and hire minde
    On Troilus longe syne, so firme and faste,
    That alle the world hire love myghte nat vnbynde,
    Ne Troilus from out hire bosom caste,
    For she was his, as longe as lyf shal laste.
    And thus distracted both by love and drede,
    She scarcly coude tell the sooth fro the dede.

    It is the comune use in every lond
    For ladyes to be glad of gentil cheere,
    And now ther cam to Criseyde a lond
    Both glad and sorweful, as men myghte it deeme;
    And with hir gossypis, wich were nought of reeme,
    These ladyes that in Troy unhapely dwellen,
    They saten hem doun and spak as I shal telle.

    “O, I am glad,” quod oon, “ye shul have play,
    That now your fader ye shul sone have syght!”
    Another seyde, “By God, it is not fay,
    For all too little shal she dwelle here tennight!”
    “I hope,” quod that thirde, “that she shal bryng
    Us pees and blisse on every party syde,
    And whan she goth, God be to hire a gyde!”

    These wordes and mo, of wommanly plente,
    She herde, but nothyng hadde in her thought;
    Another syght hire herte bigan to sente,
    Altho body she sat, yet was she nought.
    God woot, her thoughtes weren al to oother brought,
    For Troilus on him was al her eye,
    For whom she hadde no speche, but al her pley.

    These ladyes, al for to plese and to don good,
    Hem spenden in gossyping hir delit,
    Wherinne Criseyde coude fynde no restood,
    Nor with hire burning herte biwaxe and sit;
    Scarce long she myghte loke for to be quit;
    She felte hir-self al redy for to dye
    With alle this talke that made hire sore agrye.

    At last she myghte no lenger lede the teres,
    For up they ronnen, syngne of inward peyne,
    In whiche hire woful spiryt muste abyde and fere,
    Remembering from hevene to which infernalle eyne
    She falen was, sith she forgat the syghte
    Of Troilus, and sorwefully she syghte.

    And alle the foles that saten hem aboute
    Wenden that she wepte and syked so sore,
    Bicause she sholde sone from Troye route
    Departe, and nevere pleye with hemne more;
    And they that had y-known hir eftsoone yore
    Seyde that they saugh hire wepe, and thoughte it kyndnesse,
    And eche of hem wepte eke for hire distresse.

    And bisily they gonnen hire confonen
    Of thinges, God wot, on which she litel thoughte;
    And with hir tales wolden hire disporten,
    And to be glad they ofte hire bisoughte.
    But swich ese ther-with they hire wroghte,
    Right as a man is eased for to fele
    For ache of heed, to clawn him on his hele.

    But after al this nice vanitee
    They took hire leve and hoom they wenten alle.
    Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,
    Into hire chambre up wente out of the halle.
    And on hire bed she gan for deed to falle,
    In purpos nevere thennes for to rise;
    And thus she wroughe, as I shal yow devyse.

    Therwith the teres from hire eyen two
    Doun fille, as shorn in Aprill ful swithe;
    Hire whyte brest she bet, and for the wo
    After the deeth she cryed a thousand sythe.
    Syn he that wont hire wo was for to lythe,
    She moot for-goon; for which disaventure
    She held hir-self a forlost creature.

    Hire rounde heer, that sonnish was of hewe,
    She rente, and eke hire fingres longe and smale
    She wrong ful ofte, and bad God on hire rewe,
    And with the deeth to doon bote on hire bale.
    Hire hewe, whilom bright, that tho was pale,
    Bar witnesse of hire wo and hire constreynte;
    And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hire compleynte:

    “Alas!” quod she, “out of this regioun
    I, woful wrecche and infortunat wight,
    And born in corsed constellacioun,
    Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight;
    Woe worth, alasse! that ilke dayes light
    On which I saw him first with eyen tweyne,
    That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!”

    She seyde, “How shal he doon, and I also?
    How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
    O dere herte eke, that I love so,
    Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?
    O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne!
    O moder min, that cleped were Argive,
    Woe worth that day that thou me bare on lyve!”

    To what end sholde I live and sorwen thus?
    How sholde a fish withouten water dure?
    What is Criseyde worth, fro Troilus?
    How sholde a plant or lyvynge creature
    Live withouten his kinde noriture?
    For which ful ofte a by-word here I seye,
    That, “Toteleess, most grene shortly deye.”

    I shal don thus, sith neither swerd ne darte
    Dare I non handle, for the crueltee
    That ilke day that I from yow departe,
    If sorwe of that nil not be my bane,
    Than shal no mete ne drinke come in me
    Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe;
    And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe.

    And, Troilus, my clopes everichoon
    Shul blake been, in tokeninge, herte swete,
    That I am as out of this world agoon.
    That wont was yow to setten in quiete;
    And of myn ordre, ay til deeth me mete,
    The observance ever, in your absence,
    Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence.

    Myn herte and eke the woful goost ther-inne
    Biquethe I, with your spirit to compleyne
    Eterne, for they shul nevere twinne.
    For though in erthe y-twinned be we tweyne,
    Yet in the felde of pitee, out of peyne,
    That hight Elysos, shul we been y-fere,
    As Orpheus and Eurydice his fere.

    Thus herte myn, for Antenor, alasse!
    I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene.
    But how shul ye doon in this sorwful cas,
    How shal your tendre herte this sustene?
    But herte myn, for-yet this sorwe and tene,
    And me also; for, soothly for to seye,
    So ye wel fare, I recche nought to deye.

    Who myghte it evere rede ben or songe,
    The pleinte that she made in hire distresse?
    I not; but, as for me, my litel tonge,
    If I discroven wolde hire hevinesse,
    It sholde make hire sorwe seme lesse
    Than that it was, and childishly deface
    Hire high compleinte, and therfore I it passe.

    Pandarus, that sent fro Troilus
    Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devyse,
    That for the beste it was accorded thus,
    And he ful glad to doon him that servyse,
    Unto Criseyde, in a ful secree wyse,
    Theras she lay in torment and in rage,
    Cam he hir to telle al holly his message.

    And found that she hir-self gan to trete
    Ful pitously; for with hir sake
    Hire brest, hire face y-bathed was ful wete;
    The mighty tresses of hire sonnish heres
    Unbroyden, hangen al about hire eres;
    Which yaf him verray signal of martyre
    Of deeth, which that hire herte gan desire.

    Whan she him saw, she gan for sorwe anoon
    Hire teary face a-twixe hire armes hyde;
    For which this Pandarus is so wo bigoon,
    That in the hous he myghte unnethe abyde,
    As he that pitee felte on every side.
    For if Criseyde hadde erst compleyned sore,
    Tho gan she pleyne a thousand tymes more.

    And in hire aspre pleynt than she seide,
    “Pandar, first of joyes mo than two
    That me broughte into thy servyse of love,
    That now transformed ben in cruel wo,
    Where shal I seye to yow ‘welcome’ or no?
    That elderfirst me broughte into service,
    Of love, alasse! that endeth in swich wise?

    Endeth than love in wo? Ye, or men lyen!
    And alle worldly blisse, as thinketh me,
    The ende of blisse ay sorwe it occupieth;
    And whoso troweth not that it so be,
    Lat him upon me, woful wrecche, y-see,
    That my-self hate, and ay my birthe acorse,
    Feelinge alwey, from wikke I go to worse.

    Whoso me seeth, he seeth sorwe al at ones,
    Peyne, torment, pleynte, wo, distresse.
    Out of my woful body harm ther noon is,
    As anguish, langour, cruel bitternesse,
    Annoy, smert, drede, fury, and eke siknesse.
    I trowe, y-wis, from hevene teres reigne
    For pitee of myn aspre and cruel peyne!”

    “And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,”
    Quod Pandarus, “what thenkestow to do?
    Why ne hastow to thy-selven som resort,
    Why woltow thus thy-selven, alasse, for-do?
    Leef al this werk and tak now hede to
    That I shal seyn, and herkne of good entente,
    This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.”

    Tomed hir tho Criseyde, a wo makinge
    So greet that it a deeth was for to see:—
    “Alas!” quod she, “what wordes may ye bringe?
    What wol my dere herte seyn to me,
    Which that I drede nevermo to see?
    Wol he have pleynte or teres, er I wende?
    I have ynowe, if he ther-after sende!”

    She was right swich to seen in hire visage
    As is that wight that men on bere binde;
    Hire face, lyk of Paradys the image,
    Was al y-chaunged in another kinde.
    The pleye, the laughtre men was wont to finde
    In hire, and eke hire joies everychone,
    Ben fled, and thus lith now Criseyde allone.

    Aboute hire eyen two a purpre ring
    Bitrent, in soothfast tokeninge of hire peyne,
    That to biholde it was a dedly thing,
    For which Pandarus myghte nat restreyne
    The teres from his eyen for to rayne.
    But nathelees, as he best myghte, he seyde
    From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.

    “Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how
    The king, with other lordes, for the best
    Hath made eschaunge of Antenor and yow,
    That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
    But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,
    That may no earthly mannes tonge seye;
    For verray wo his wit is al aweye.

    For which we han so sorwed, he and I,
    That unto litel bothe it hadde us slawe;
    But thurgh my conseil this day, finally,
    He somewhat is fro weping now withdrawe.
    And semeth me that he desireth fain
    With yow to been al night, for to devyse
    Remede in this, if ther were any wyse.

    This, short and pleyn, the effect of my message,
    As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.
    For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,
    May to no long prologe as now entende;
    And here-upon ye may answere him and sende.
    And for the love of God, my nece dere,
    So leef this wo er Troilus be here.”

    “Gret is my wo,” quod she, and sighte sore,
    As she that feeleth dedly sharpe distresses;
    “But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more,
    That love him bet than he him-self, I gess.
    Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse?
    Can he for me so pitiously compleyne?
    Y-wis, this sorwe doubleth al my peyne.

    “Grevous to me, God wot, is for to twinne,”
    Quod she, “but yet it hardere is to me
    To see that sorwe which that he is inne;
    For wel wot I, it wol my bane be;
    And deye I wol in certeyn,” tho quod she;
    “But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me thretneth,
    Dryve out that goost which in myn herte beteth.”

    Thise wordes seyd, she on hire armes two
    Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitiously.
    Quod Pandarus, “Alas! why do ye so,
    Syn wel ye wot the tyme is faste by
    That he shal come? Arise up hastely,
    That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde.
    But ye wol han him wood out of his minde.

    For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere,
    He wolde him-selve slee; and if I wende
    To han this fare, he sholde not come here
    For al the good that Priam may despende.
    For to what fun he wolde anoon pretende,
    That knowe I wel; and forthy yet I seye,
    So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye.

    Strive rather now his sorwe to releve
    And not to magnify it, deare nece;
    Hard proses wol not joy restore.
    But soft and gentle weyes shal ye pece.
    What helpeth is to wepen ful a strete,
    Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte?
    Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte.

    I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe,
    Syn ye ben wise and bothe of oon assent,
    So shapeth how to distourbe your goinge,
    Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.
    Wommen ben wyse in short avisement;
    And lat se now how your wit shal now availe;
    And what that I may helpe, it shal not faile.”

    “Go,” quod Criseyde, “and, uncle, trewely,
    I shal don al my might, me to restreyne
    From weping in his sight, and bisily
    Him for to glade, I shal don al my peyne,
    And in myn herte seken every veyne;
    If to this soor ther may be founden salve,
    It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.”

    Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he sought,
    Til in a temple he found him allone,
    As he that of his lyf no lenger rought;
    But to the pitous goddes everichone
    Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone,
    To doon him sone out of this world to pace;
    For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.

    And shortly, al the sothe for to seye,
    He was so fallen in despeir that day,
    That outrely he shoop him for to deye.
    For right thus was his argument alwey:
    He seyde he nas but lorn, waylawey!
    “For al that comth, comth by necessitee;
    Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.

    For certeynly, this wot I wel,” he seyde,
    “That foresight of divine purveiaunce
    Hath seyn alwey me to forgoon Criseyde,
    Sin God seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,
    And hem desponeth through his ordinaunce,
    In hire merites, sothly for to be,
    As they shul comen by predestinee.

    But nathelees, alasse! whom shal I leve?
    For ther ben grete clerkes many oon,
    That destinee through argumentes preve;
    And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon;
    But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.
    O welaway! so slye aren clerkes olde,
    That I not whos opinioun I may holde.

    For som men seyn, if God seeth al bifore,
    Ne God may nat deceived be, pardee;
    Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn,
    That purveiaunce hath seyn bifore to be.
    Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he
    Hath wiste biforen our thought eek as our dede,
    We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.

    For other thought nor other dede also
    Might nevere be, but swich as purveiaunce,
    Which may not been deceyved nevermo,
    Hath felde bifore, withouten ignorawnce.
    For if ther mighte been a variaunce
    To writhe out fro Goddes purveying,
    Ther nere no prescience of thing comyng.

    But it were rather an opinioun
    Uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseynge;
    And certes that were an abusio n,
    That God sholde have no parfit cleer witinge
    More than we men that han doutous weninge.
    But swich an errour upon God to gesse
    Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.

    Eke this is an opinioun of somme
    That han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shorne;
    They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come,
    For that the prescience hath seyn bifore
    That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore
    That it shal come, therfore the purveyance
    Wot it bifore withouten ignorance.

    And in this manere this necessitee
    Returneth in his part contrarie agayn;
    For needely bihoveth it nat to be
    That thilke thinges fallen in certeyn
    That ben purveyed; but neidely, as they seyn,
    Bihoveth it that thinges which that falle
    That they in certeyn ben purveyed alle.

    I mene as though I laboured me in this
    To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be;
    As whether that the prescience of God is
    The certeyn cause of the necessitee
    Of thinges that to comen been, pardee;
    Or if necessitee of thing comyng
    Be cause certeyn of the purveying.

    But now ne enforcen I me nat in shewinge
    How the ordre of causses stant; but wel wot I,
    That it bihoveth that the bifallinge
    Of thinges wist biforen certeynly
    Be necessarie, alse seme it nat therby
    That prescience put falling necessarie
    To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire.

    For if ther sit a man yond on a see, ...

Than by necessittee bihoveth it  
That, certes, thyn opinioun soth be,  
That wenest or conjectest that he sit;  
And ferther-over now ayenward yit,  
Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,  
As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie):

I seye, that if the opinioun of thee  
Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this,  
That he mot sitten by necessitee;

142

For neither thought ne deed mighte ever be,  
Or any thing, withouten forcordinaunce,  
In which ther myghte be no variation,  
Perceyveth it withouten any doute;  
For if ther were any slighte doutinge,  
Or eny slip in Goddes foreordinaunce,  
Therfore his prescience were not stable.

143

But rather ought men calle it hope,  
Unstedefast, and not prescience certein;  
And that were fals and an abhominacioun,  
For Goddes prescience for to change  
To mennes errour and to doute so vaine;  
In God to hye such mysdedes to seyne  
Were fals and foule and cursed treason.

144

And therto comen folk of holy churche,  
That seyn, what-so that sucedeth by ordinaunce,  
It comth nat because God hath forme it,  
But rather for it shal come,—they seyn,—and so  
Prescience is but knowledge therof.

145

But here is cause of swich perplexitee  
That nedely moste by som man be tolde,  
Whether that thinges comen for to be  
For that they ben ordeyned by prescience;  
And yet this verrayte, after myn avis,  
That al that shal betyde, it moot be ordyned.

146

Ye seen that I seke for to knowe  
Which is the cause and which the effect;  
Is Goddes prescience cause in alle thinges,  
As necessitee in his purveiaunce,  
Or elles is necessitee in thinges first,  
That maken God to forsee hem certein?

147

I nil nat seye how thilke reson stant,  
But this I seye,—all that shal be, shall be,  
And was y-forscene in such wyse certein,  
That by that prescience it was made nedeful;  
Yet nathelees, prescience doth nat sayë  
That thing is nedeful for that it was y-wist.

148

For if a man sitt on chaire, trowe ye me,  
Ther nis no remedy, it muste be so,  
That he sitteth there; and thus a soth say ye,  
And also for to speke a contrarie,  
Of bothe shal come necessitee ywis,  
For in him nedeth sitting, and in thee soth;  
And thus moot necessitee be in yow bothe.

149

But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,  
That thyn opinioun of sittinge soth is;  
But rather, for the man sat ther bifore,  
Therfore is thyn opinioun soth, y-wis.  
And I seye, though the cause of soth of this  
Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee  
Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.

150

Thus on this same wise, out of doubtaunce,  
I may wel maken, as it semeth me,  
My resouninge of Goddes purveiaunce,  
And of the þinges that to comen be;  
By whiche resoun men may wel y-see  
That thilke þinges that in erthe falle  
That by necessitee they comen alle.

151

For al-though that, for þe þing shal come, y-wis,  
Therfore is it purveyed, certeinly,  
Nat that it comth for it purveyed is;  
Yet nathelees bihoveth it nedfully,  
That þing to come be purveyed, trewely;  
Or elles thinges that purveyed be,  
Ther they bityden by necessitee.

152

And this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn,  
For to destroye our free chois everydel.  
But now is this abusion to seyn,  
That fallinge of the þinges temporel  
Is cause of Goddes prescience eternel.  
Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,  
That þing to come sholde cause his prescience.

153

What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought,  
But that God purveith þing that is to come  
For that it is to come, and elles nought?  
So mighte I wene that þinges alle and some,  
That whylom been bifalle and over-come,  
Ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveiaunce,  
That for-wot hem al with-outen ignoraunce.

154

And over al this, yet seye I more herto,  
That right as whan I woot ther is a þing,  
Y-wis, that þing mot nedefully be so;  
Eek right so, whan I woot a þing cominge,  
So mot it come; and thus the bifalling  
Of þinges that ben wist bifore the tyde,  
They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.

155

Than seyde he thus, “Almighty Jove in trone,  
That wost of al this þing the soothfastnesse,  
Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone,  
Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.”  
And whyl he was in al this hevinesse,  
Disputinge with himself in this matere,  
Cam Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.

156

“O mighty God,” quod Pandarus, “in trone,  
Ey! who so sigh ever a wise man faren so?  
Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?  
Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?  
What, parde, yet is not Criseyde ago!  
Why lust thee so thy-self for-doon for drede,  
That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede?

157

Hastow not lived many a yeer bifore  
Withouten hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?  
Artow for hir and for non other born?  
Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese?  
Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese:  
That, in the daïs right as ther fallen chaunces,  
Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.

158

And yet this is a wonder most of alle,  
Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit  
Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,  
Ne if she can hir-self distourbe it.  
Thou hast not yet assayd al hir wit.  
A man may al by tyme his nekke bede  
Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.

159

Forthy take hede of that that I shal seye;  
I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be.  
So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.  
And ever-mo me thinketh thus, that she  
Hath somwhat in hir hertes privetee,  
Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede,  
Distourbe al this, of which thou art in drede.

160

For which my conseil is, whan it is night,  
Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;  
And blisful Juno, thorugh hir grete might,  
Shal, as I hope, hir grace unto us sende.  
Myn herte seyth, ‘certeyn, she shal not wende;’  
And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste;  
And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.”

161

This Troilus answerde, and sighde sore,  
“Thou seist right wel, and I wil do right so”;  
And what him liste, he seyde unto it more.  
And whan that it was tyme for to go,  
Ful prevely himself withouten mo,  
Unto hir com, as he was wont to done;  
And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.

162

Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,  
So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste,  
That neither of hem other mighte grete,  
But hem in armes toke and after kiste.  
The lasse woful of hem bothe niste  
Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe,  
As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge.

163

Tho woful teres that they leten falle  
As bittre weren, out of teres kinde.  
For peyne, as is ligne-aloge or galle,  
So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde.  
The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde  
That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,  
That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte.

164

But whan hir wandring wery spirites tweyne  
Returned were ther-as hem oghte dwelle,  
And that somwhat to walken gan the peine  
By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle  
Of hir teres, and the herte unswelle;  
With broken vois, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde  
To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde:

165

“O Jove, I dye, and mercy I beseche!  
Help, Troilus!” and ther-with-al hir face  
Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche;  
Hir woful spirit from his propre place  
Right with the word alwey up poynt to pace;  
And thus she lith with hewes pale and grene,  
That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene.

166

This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,  
Clepinge hir name (and she lay as for deed,  
Withouten answere, and felt hir limes colde,  
Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),  
This sorwful man can now noon other reed,  
But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste;  
Wher him was wo, God and him-self it wiste.

167

He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde;  
For signe of lif, for ought he can or may.  
Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde,  
For which his song ful ofte is “weylaway!”  
But whan he saugh that spechless she lay,  
With sorwful vois, and herte of blisse al bare,  
He seide how she was fro this world y-fare.

168

So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned,  
His hondes wronge, and seide that was to seye;  
And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned,  
He gan tho teres wipe of ful dreye,  
And pitously gan for the soule preye,  
And seide, “O Lord, that set art in thy trone,  
Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!”

169

She cold was and withouten sentement.  
For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;  
And this was him a preignant argument  
That she was forth out of this world agoon;  
And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,  
He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere  
As men don hem that shul be leid on bere.

170

And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,  
His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte,  
Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte,  
So that his soule hir soule folwen mighte,  
Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte;  
Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,  
That in this world he lenger liven sholde.

171

Thanne seide he thus, fulfil of heigh desdayn,  
“O cruel Jove, and thou Fortune adverse,  
This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn  
Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,  
Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!  
Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;  
Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.

172

For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus,  
Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye;  
Shal never lover seyn that Troilus  
Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye;  
For certeyn, I wol here hir compaignye.  
But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,  
Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-ferc.

173

And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,  
And thou, Priam, and bretheren al y-fere,  
And thou, my moder, farewell, for I go;  
And Atropos, make redy thou my bere!  
And thou, Criseyde, O swete herte dere,  
Receyve now my spirit!” wolde he seye,  
With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye.

174

But as God wold, of swough therwith she abreyde,  
And gan to syke, and “Troilus” she cryde;  
And he answerde, “Lady myn Criseyde,  
Live ye yet?” and leet his swerd doun glyde.  
“Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupide!”  
Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte;  
And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte.

175

Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,  
And hir to glade he dide al his entente;  
For which hir goost, that flikered aye on-lofte,  
Into hir woful herte ayein it wente.  
But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente  
Asyde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye,  
As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye,

176

And asked him why he it hadde out-drawe?  
And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,  
And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.  
For which Criseyde upon him gan biholde,  
And gan him in hir armes faste folde,  
And seide, “O mercy, God, lo, which a dede!  
Allas! how neigh we were bothe dede!

177

Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,  
Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?” quod she.  
“Ye, douteles”; and she answerde, “allas!  
For by that ilke Lord that made me,  
I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be,  
After your deeth, to han be crowned quene  
Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene.

178

But with this selve swerd, which that here is,  
My-selve I wolde have slayn!” quod she tho;  
“But ho, for we han right y-now of this,  
And late us rise and streight to bedde go,  
And ther lat us speken of our wo.  
For by the morter which that I see brenne,  
Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.”

179

Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,  
Nought was it lyk tho nyghtes here-biforn;  
For pitiously ech other gan biholde,  
As they that hadden al hir blisse y-lom,  
Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born.  
Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde  
To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde:

180

“Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,” quod she,  
“That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne,  
And seeketh nought how holpen for to be,  
It nis but folye and encrees of peyne;  
And sin that here assembled be we tweyne  
To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,  
It were al tyme sone to bigenne.

181

I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,  
And as I am avysed sodeynly,  
So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot.  
Me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor I  
Oughte half this wo to make carefullie;  
For there is art y-now for to redresse  
That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.

182

Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne,  
For ought I wot, for no-thing dies is  
But for the cause that we sholden twinne.  
Considered al, ther nis no-more amis.  
But what is thanne a remede unto this,  
But that we shape us sone for to mete?  
This al and som, my dere herte swete.

183

Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute  
To come ayein, sone after that I go,  
Therof am I no maner thing in doute.  
For dredeles, withinne a wooke or two,  
I shal ben here; and that it may be so  
By alle right, and in a wordes fewe,  
I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe.

184

For which I wol not make long sermoun,  
For tyme y-lost may not recovered be;  
But I wol gon to my conclusioun,  
And to the beste, in ought that I can see.  
And, for the love of God, foryeve it me  
If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste;  
For trewely, I speke it for the beste.

185

Makinge alwey a protestacioun,  
That now these wordes, whiche that I shal seye,  
Nis but to shewe yow my mocioun  
To finde unto our helpe the beste weye;  
And taketh it non other wise, I preye.  
For in effect what-so ye me comaunde,  
That wol I doon, for that is no demandaunce.

186

Now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde,  
My going granted is by parlement  
So ferforth, that it may not be withstonde  
For al this world, as by my jugement.  
And sin ther helpeth noon avysement  
To letten it, lat it passe out of minde;  
And lat us shape a better wey to finde.

187

The sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne  
Wol us disese and cruelliche anoye.  
But him bihoveth somtyme han a peine  
That serveth love, if that he wol have joye.

for all his trouble and his kindly care,

## BOOK V

### Middle English

And in his fancy now her beauty shone  
Afresh, and in his mind he caught the tone  
Of her dear voice; four days he managed so,  
And then resolved back home at once to go.

69

“Pandar,” said he, “what are you thinking about?  
Do you intend to keep on staying here,  
Until Sarpedon tells us to get out?  
I’m sure ’twill more considerate appear  
For us to go; and now as eve draws near.  
Let’s say goodbye, and homeward let us turn,  
For I just cannot longer here sojourn.”

70

“Did we come here,” said Pandar, “fetching fire,  
To turn and run straight home with it again?  
What better place than this can you desire?  
We’re with the most hospitable of men,  
Sarpedon will but take it sadly when  
We go, and your so hasty attitude  
Would be, I think, unpardonably rude.

71

“Because we said that we had come to stay  
A week with him, and now in so great haste  
And on the fourth day thus to go away  
Would hurt his feelings and be shocking taste;  
He has himself at our disposal placed,  
And since we’ve promised here a week to bide,  
We should do so, and homeward then may ride.”

72

Thus Pandar, both with force and argument,  
Held him until the week had reached its end;  
Sarpedon then they thanked and homeward went,  
For Troilus would not his stay extend.  
“Now God,” he said, “this favor to me send,  
That Cressida will be my welcoming,  
When I get home,” and so began to sing.

73

“Yes, in your eye,” was what wise Pandar thought,  
And to himself he said, quite soft and low,

“God wot, refreshed may this hot fare,  
Hir Calchas sende Troilus Criseyde!”  

But natheless, he japed thus, and seyde,  
And swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte.  
She wolde come as sone as ever she mighte.

74

Whan they unto the paleys were y-comen  
Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte,  
And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen.  
And in-to tyme that it gan to nighté,  
They spaken of Criseyde the brighte.  
And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,  
They spedde hem fro the soper unto reste.

75

“O, you’ll cool off, my boy, if I know aught,  
Ere Calchas lets his daughter from him go!”  
But still of confidence he made a show,  
And said that something told him in his heart  
That she would come as soon as she could start.  
And when at eve they reached the palace gate,  
Down from their horses quickly they alight,  
And to the room of Troilus go straight,  
And sit them down and talk till almost night.  
Which talk was all of Cressida the bright,  
And afterward, when so they felt inclined,  
They went to bed, though first, of course, they dined.

76

Next day, before the morning lights shone clear,  
Troilus awoke, and leaping from his bed,  
He routed Pandar out, his brother dear,  
“For love of God,” most plaintively he said,  
“I cannot rest until I’ve visited  
Her house, and though my eyes I cannot feast  
On her, I can her palace see at least.”

77

He found some way his household to mislead,  
And he and Pandar to the town then go,  
And to his lady’s house at once proceed,  
But, Lord, he only hastened to his woe!  
He thought his heart with grief must overflow,  
For when he saw the doors still bolted tight,  
Upon his horse he scarce could sit upright.

78

For with one fatal glance his eyes behold  
That shut is every window of the place,  
And at the sight his heart like ice grows cold;  
Without a word, and deadly pale of face,  
Forth by the palace doth he madly race;  
He spurs his horse and rides away full speed,  
And of no man he takes the slightest heed.

79

“O palace desolate,” he then began,  
“O house, of houses once most dear to sight!  
O palace, empty and accursed of man!  
O lantern, wherein now is quenched the light!  
O dwelling, once my day, now turned to night!  
Why dost thou stand, while all my joys decay,  
And she is gone, who was my hope and stay.

80

“O palace, once the crown of houses all,  
Illumined with the sun of every bliss!  
O ring, from which the ruby now doth fall!  
O cause of woe, but cause of joy ere this!  
Yet lacking better, fain now would I kiss  
Thy doorways cold, if folk were not about!  
Act farewell, shrine, from which the saint is out!”

81

On Pandar then he cast his mournful eye,  
With face all drawn and dreadful to behold,  
And interrupted oft with many a sigh,  
To him the devastating tale he told,  
Of sorrow new and former joys grown old;  
And pain sat on his countenance so grim,  
No heart so hard but must have pitied him.

82

Fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun,  
And every thing com him to remembraunce  
As he rood forth by places of the toun  
In which he whylom hadde al his plesaunce.  
“Lo, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce;  
And in that temple, with hir eyen clere,  
Me caughte first my righte lady dere.

83

And yonder have I herd ful lustily  
My dere herte laughe, and yonder pleye  
Saugh I hir ones eek ful blisfully.  
And yonder ones to me gan she seye,  
‘Now goode swete, love me wel, I preye.’  
And yond so goodly gan she me biholde,  
That to the deeth myn herte is to hir holde.

84

And at that corner, in the yonder hous,  
Herde I myn alderlevest lady dere  
So wommanly, with voys melodious,  
Singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere,  
That in my soule yet me thinketh I here  
The blisful soun; and, in that yonder place,  
My lady first me took unto hir grace.

85

Thanne thoughte he thus, “O blisful lord Cupyde,  
Whanne I the proces have in my memorie,  
How thou me hast werreyed on every syde.  
Men mighte a book make of it, lyk a storie.  
What nede is thee to seke on me victorie,  
Sin I am thyn, and hooly at thy wille?  
What joye hastow thyn owene folk to spille?

86

Wel hastow, lord, y-wroke on me thyn ire,  
Thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve!  
Now mercy, lord, thou wost wel I desire  
Thy grace most, of alle lustes leve.  
And live and deye I wol in thy bileve;  
For which I n’axe in guerdon but a bone,  
That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone.

87

Distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne  
As thou dost myn to longen hir to see;  
Than woot I wel, that she nil not sojorne.  
Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be  
Unto the blood of Troye, I preye thee,  
As Juno was unto the blood Thebane,  
For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.”

88

And after this he to the yates wente  
Ther-as Criseyde out-rood a ful good paas,  
And up and doun ther made he many a wente.  
And to him-self ful ofte he seyde “Alas!  
From hennes rood my blisse and my solas!  
As wolde blisful god now, for his joye,  
I mighte hir seen ayein come into Troye.

89

And to the yonder hille I gan hir gyde,  
Allas! and there I took of hir my leve!  
And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ryde.  
For sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve.  
And hider hoom I com whan it was eve;

90

And of himself imagined he ofte  
To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse  
Than he was wont, and that men scyde softe,  
“What may it be? who can the sothe gesse  
Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?”  
And al this nas but his melancolie,  
That he hadde of himself swich fantasye.

91

Another tyme imaginen he wolde  
That every wight that wente by the weye  
Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde,  
“I am right sory Troilus wol deye.”  
And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye.  
As ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede,  
As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede.

92

For which him lyked in his songes shewe  
Th’encheson of his wo, as he best mighte,  
And make a song of wordes but a fewe,  
Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.  
And whan he was from every mannes sight,  
With softe voys he, of his lady dere,  
That was absent, gan singe as ye may here.

93

“O sterre, of which I lost have al the light,  
With herte soor wel oughte I to bewayle,  
That ever derk in torment, night by night,  
Toward my deeth with wind in stere I sayle;  
For which the tente night if that I fayle  
The gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre,  
My ship and me Charybdis wol devoure.”

94

This song when he thus songen hadde, sone  
He fil ayein into his sykes olde;  
And every night, as was his wone to done,  
He stood the brighte mone to beholde,  
And al his sorwe he to the mone tolde;  
And seyde, “Y-wis, whan thou art horned newe,  
I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!

95

I saugh thyn homes olde eek by the morwe,  
Whan hennes rood my rightc lady dere,  
That cause is of my torment and my some;  
For whiche, O brighte Lucina the dere,  
For love of God, ren faste aboute thy spere!  
For whan thyn homes newe ginne springe,  
Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!”

96

The day is more, and lenger every night,  
Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho;  
And that the sonne wente his course unright  
By lenger wey than it was wont to go;  
And seyde, “Y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo,  
The sonnes sone, Pheton, be on-lyve,  
And that his fadres cart amis he dryve.”

97

“Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free,  
Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be!  
And thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote,  
That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.  
And hardely this wind, that more and more  
Thus stoundemcle encreseth in my face,  
Is of my ladyes depe sykes sore.

98

I preve it thus, for in non othere place  
Of al this toun, save onliche in this space,  
Fele I no wind that souneth so lyk peyne;  
It seyth, ‘Alas! why twinned be we tweyne?’”

99

This longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus,  
Til fully passed was the nynthe night;  
And ay bisyde him was this Pandarus,  
That bisily dide alle his fulle might,  
Him to comforte, and make his herte light;  
Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe  
That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe.

100

Upon that other syde eek was Criseyde,  
With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;  
For which ful ofte a day “Alas!” she seyde,  
“That I was born! Wei may myn herte longe  
After my deeth; for now live I to longe!  
Allas! and I ne may it not amende;  
For now is wors than ever yet I wende.

101

My fader nil for no-thing do me grace  
To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;  
And if so be that I my terme passe,  
My Troilus shal in his herte deme  
That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.  
Thus shal I have unthank on every syde;  
That I was born, so weylawey the tyde!

102

And if that I me putte in jupartye,  
To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle  
That I be caught, I shal be holde a spye;  
Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle.  
If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle,  
I am but lost, al be my herte trewe;  
Now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!”

103

Ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face,  
Hir limes lene, as she that al the day  
Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place  
Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.  
And al the night wepinge, “Alas!” she lay.  
And thus despeired, out of alle cure,  
She ladde hir lyf, this woful creature.

104

Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse,  
And in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge  
Of Troilus the gret worthinesse,  
And alle his goodly wordes recordinge  
Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.  
And thus she sette hir woful herte afyre  
Thorough remembraunce of that she gan desire.

105

Ful rewfully she loked upon Troye,  
Biheld the toures heighe and eke the halles;  
“Allas!” quod she, “the plesaunce and the joye  
The whiche that now al torned into galle is.  
Have I had ofte with-inne yonder walks!  
O Troilus, what dostow now,” she seyde;  
“Lord! whether yet thou thenke up-on Criseyde?

106

Allas! I ne hadde trowed on your lore,  
And went with yow, as ye me radde er this!  
Thanne hadde I now not syked half so sore.  
Who mighte have seyd, that I had doon amis  
To stele awey with swich on as he is?  
But al to late cometh the letuarie,  
Whan men the cors unto the grave carie.

107

To late is now to speke of this matere;  
Prudence, alas! oon of thin eyen three  
Me lakked alwey, er that I cam here;  
On tyme y-passed, wel remembred me;  
And present tyme eek coude I wel y-see.  
But futur tyme, er I was in the snare,  
Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care.

108

But natheless, bityde what bityde,  
I shal tomorwe at night, by est or weste,  
Out of this ost stele on som maner syde,  
And go with Troilus wher-as him leste.  
This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste.  
No fors of wikked tonges janglerye,  
For every on love han wrecche had envye.

109

For who-so wole of every word take hede,  
Or rewlen him by every wightes wit,  
Ne shal he never thryven, out of drede.  
For that that som men blamen ever yit,  
Lo, other maner folk commenden it.  
And as for me, for al swich variancë,  
Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.

110

For which, withouten any wordes mo,  
To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.”  
But God it wot, er fully monthes two,  
She was ful fer fro that entencioun.  
For bothe Troilus and Troye toun  
Shal knotcles through-out hir herte slyde;  
For she wol take a purpos for t’abyde.

111

This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,  
Goth now, withinne him-self ay arguinge  
With al the sleighte and al that ever he can,  
How he may best, with shortest taryinge,  
Into his net Criseydes herte bringe.  
To this entente he coude never fyne;  
To fisshen hir, he leyde out hook and lyne.

### Modern English (Translation)

And in his fancy now her beauty shone  
Afresh, and in his mind he caught the tone  
Of her dear voice; four days he managed so,  
And then resolved back home at once to go.

69

“Pandar,” said he, “what are you thinking about?  
Do you intend to keep on staying here,  
Until Sarpedon tells us to get out?  
I’m sure ’twill more considerate appear  
For us to go; and now as eve draws near.  
Let’s say goodbye, and homeward let us turn,  
For I just cannot longer here sojourn.”

70

“Did we come here,” said Pandar, “fetching fire,  
To turn and run straight home with it again?  
What better place than this can you desire?  
We’re with the most hospitable of men,  
Sarpedon will but take it sadly when  
We go, and your so hasty attitude  
Would be, I think, unpardonably rude.

71

“Because we said that we had come to stay  
A week with him, and now in so great haste  
And on the fourth day thus to go away  
Would hurt his feelings and be shocking taste;  
He has himself at our disposal placed,  
And since we’ve promised here a week to bide,  
We should do so, and homeward then may ride.”

72

Thus Pandar, both with force and argument,  
Held him until the week had reached its end;  
Sarpedon then they thanked and homeward went,  
For Troilus would not his stay extend.  
“Now God,” he said, “this favor to me send,  
That Cressida will be my welcoming,  
When I get home,” and so began to sing.

73

“Yes, in your eye,” was what wise Pandar thought,  
And to himself he said, quite soft and low,

“God wot, refreshed may this hot fare,  
Hir Calchas sende Troilus Criseyde!”  

But nevertheless he japed thus, and said,  
And swore, y-wis, his heart him well bethought:  
She would come as soon as ever she might.

74

When they unto the palace were come of Troilus, they down from horse alight,  
And to the chamber their way then have they taken.  
And in the time that it began to night,  
They spoke of Cressida the bright.  
And after this, when that them both pleased,  
They made haste from supper unto rest.

75

“O, you’ll cool off, my boy, if I know aught,  
Ere Calchas lets his daughter from him go!”  
But still of confidence he made a show,  
And said that something told him in his heart  
That she would come as soon as she could start.  
And when at eve they reached the palace gate,  
Down from their horses quickly they alight,  
And to the room of Troilus go straight,  
And sit them down and talk till almost night.  
Which talk was all of Cressida the bright,  
And afterward, when so they felt inclined,  
They went to bed, though first, of course, they dined.

76

Next day, before the morning lights shone clear,  
Troilus awoke, and leaping from his bed,  
He roused Pandar out, his brother dear,  
“For love of God,” most plaintively he said,  
“I cannot rest until I’ve visited  
Her house, and though my eyes I cannot feast  
On her, I can her palace see at least.”

77

He found some way his household to mislead,  
And he and Pandar to the town then go,  
And to his lady’s house at once proceed,  
But, Lord, he only hastened to his woe!  
He thought his heart with grief must overflow,  
For when he saw the doors still bolted tight,  
Upon his horse he scarce could sit upright.

78

For with one fatal glance his eyes beheld  
That shut was every window of the place,  
And at the sight his heart like ice grew cold;  
Without a word, and deadly pale of face,  
Forth by the palace did he madly race;  
He spurs his horse and rides away full speed,  
And of no man he takes the slightest heed.

79

“O palace desolate,” he then began,  
“O house, of houses once most dear to sight!  
O palace, empty and accursed of man!  
O lantern, wherein now is quenched the light!  
O dwelling, once my day, now turned to night!  
Why dost thou stand, while all my joys decay,  
And she is gone, who was my hope and stay.

80

“O palace, once the crown of houses all,  
Illumined with the sun of every bliss!  
O ring, from which the ruby now doth fall!  
O cause of woe, but cause of joy ere this!  
Yet lacking better, fain now would I kiss  
Thy doorways cold, if folk were not about!  
Act farewell, shrine, from which the saint is out!”

81

On Pandar then he cast his mournful eye,  
With face all drawn and dreadful to behold,  
And interrupted oft with many a sigh,  
To him the devastating tale he told,  
Of sorrow new and former joys grown old;  
And pain sat on his countenance so grim,  
No heart so hard but must have pitied him.

82

From thenceforth he rode here and up and down,  
And everything came back in memory  
As he rode by the places in the town  
In which he once had known all his pleasure.  
“Lo, yonder saw I my own lady dance;  
And in that temple, with her eyes so clear,  
Me caught first my right lady dear.

83

And yonder have I heard full lustily  
My dear heart laugh, and yonder play  
I saw her once also full blissfully.  
And yonder once to me she came to say,  
‘Now good sweet, love me well, I pray.’  
And yonder so goodly she me beheld,  
That to the death my heart is to her held.

84

And at that corner, in that yonder house,  
I heard my most beloved lady dear  
So womanly, with voice melodious,  
Singing so well, so goodly, and so clear,  
That in my soul yet seems I hear  
The blissful sound; and, in that yonder place,  
My lady first took me unto her grace.

85

Then thought he thus, “O blissful lord Cupid,  
When I the process have in my memory,  
How thou me hast warred on every side.  
A man might make a book of it, like a story.  
What need is there for thee to seek victory over me,  
Since I am thine, and wholly at thy will?  
What joy hast thou to slay thine own folk?

86

Well hast thou, lord, avenged on me thy ire,  
Thou mighty god, and dreadful to be grieved!  
Now mercy, lord, thou knowest well I desire  
Thy grace most, of all lusts leave.  
And live and die I will in thy belief;  
For which I ask in guerdon but a boon,  
That thou Cressida again to me send soon.

87

Constrain her heart as fast to return  
As thou dost mine to long her to see;  
Then know I well, that she will not sojourn.  
Now, blissful lord, so cruel thou be not  
Unto the blood of Troy, I pray thee,  
As Juno was unto the blood of Thebes,  
For which the folk of Thebes took her bane.”

88

And after this he went to the gates  
Where Cressida had ridden out at a good pace,  
And up and down there made he many a go.  
And to himself full often he said, “Alas!  
From hence rode my bliss and my solace!  
As would blissful God now, for his joy,  
I might see her again come into Troy.

89

And to the yonder hill I guided her,  
Alas! and there I took of her my leave!  
And yonder I saw her to her father ride.  
For sorrow of which my heart shall cleave in two.  
And hither home I came when it was eve;

90

And oft imagined of himself he would be  
Made weak, and pale, and waxen less  
Than he was wont, and that men whispered soft,  
“What may it be? who can the truth guess  
Why Troilus hath all this heaviness?”  
And all this was but his melancholy,  
That he had of himself such fantasy.

91

Another time he would imagine  
That every wight that went by the way  
Had pity of him, and that they would say,  
“I am right sorry, Troilus will die.”  
And thus he drew a day yet forth or two.  
As you have heard, such life right did he lead,  
As he that stood betwixt hope and dread.

92

For which it pleased him in his songs to show  
The cause of his woe, as he best might,  
And make a song of words but a few,  
Somewhat his woeful heart for to lighten.  
And when he was from every man’s sight,  
With gentle voice he, of his lady dear,  
That was absent, began to sing as you may hear.

93

“O star, of which I have lost all the light,  
With sore heart well ought I to bewail,  
That ever dark in torment, night by night,  
Toward my death with wind in stern I sail;  
For which the tenth night if that I fail  
The guiding of thy beams bright an hour,  
My ship and me Charybdis will devour.”

94

This song when he thus had sung, soon  
He fell again into his old sighs;  
And every night, as was his wont to do,  
He stood the bright moon to behold,  
And all his sorrow he to the moon told;  
And said, “Y-wis, when thou art horned new,  
I shall be glad, if all the world be true!

95

I saw thy horns old also by the morrow,  
When hence rode my right lady dear,  
That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;  
For which, O bright Lucina the dear,  
For love of God, run fast about thy sphere!  
For when thy horns anew begin to spring,  
Then shall she come, that may my bliss bring!”

96

The day is more, and longer every night,  
Than they be wont to be, him seemed then;  
And that the sun went his course unright  
By longer way than it was wont to go;  
And said, “Y-wis, me dreadeth evermore,  
The sun’s son, Phaeton, be alive,  
And that his father’s chariot amiss he drives.”

97

“Lo, yonder is the one I love the most!  
Lo, yonder the tent whence, like a pining ghost,  
There comes this sighing breeze so gently blowing,  
New life upon my lifeless soul bestowing.  
And verily this wind, that more and more  
Increases steadily upon my face,  
Is from my lady’s deep sighs sore.

98

I prove it thus, for in no other place  
Of all this town, save only in this space,  
Feel I no wind that soundeth so like pain;  
It saith, ‘Alas! why parted are we twain?’”

99

This long time he drives forth right thus,  
Till fully passed was the ninth night;  
And ever beside him was this Pandarus,  
That busily did all his full might,  
Him to comfort, and make his heart light;  
Giving him hope always, the tenth to-morrow  
That she shall come, and stinting all his sorrow.

100

Upon the other side also was Cressida,  
With few women, among the Greeks strong;  
For which full often a day she said “Alas!  
That I was born! Woe may my heart long  
After my death; for now live I too long!  
Alas! and I cannot amend it;  
For now is worse than ever yet I wended.

101

My father will for nothing grant me grace  
To go again, for nought I can him please;  
And if so be that I my term pass,  
My Troilus shall in his heart deem  
That I am false, and so it may well seem.  
Thus shall I have ingratitude on every side;  
That I was born, so woe the time!

102

And if that I put myself in jeopardy,  
To steal away by night, and it befall  
That I be caught, I shall be held a spy;  
Or else, lo, this fear I most of all.  
If into the hands of some wretch I fall,  
I am but lost, although my heart be true;  
Now mighty God, thou on my sorrow rue!”

103

Full pale waxen was her bright face,  
Her limbs lean, as she that all the day  
Stood when she durst, and looked on the place  
Where she was born, and where she had dwelt always.  
And all the night weeping, “Alas!” she lay.  
And thus despairing, out of all cure,  
She led her life, this woeful creature.

104

Full often a day she sighed also for distress,  
And in herself she went aye portraying  
Of Troilus the great worthiness,  
And all his goodly words recording  
Since first that day her love began to spring.  
And thus she set her woeful heart afire  
Through remembrance of that she began to desire.

105

Full ruefully she looked upon Troy,  
Beheld the towers high and also the halls;  
“Allas!” said she, “the pleasure and the joy  
Which that now all turned into gall is.  
Have I had oft within those walks!  
O Troilus, what dost thou now,” she said;  
“Lord! whether yet thou thinkest upon Cressida?

106

Alas! I had not believed in your counsel,  
And gone with you, as ye advised me ere this!  
Then had I now not sighed half so sore.  
Who might have said that I had done amiss  
To steal away with such one as he is?  
But all too late cometh the letting,  
When men the corpse unto the grave carry.

107

Too late is now to speak of this matter;  
Prudence, alas! one of thy three eyes  
Me lacked always, ere that I came here;  
The time past, well remembered by me;  
And present time also could I well see.  
But future time, ere I was in the snare,  
Could I not see; that causeth now my care.

108

But nevertheless, betide what betide,  
I shall tomorrow at night, by east or west,  
Out of this host steal on some manner side,  
And go with Troilus wheresoever him list.  
This purpose will I hold, and this is best.  
No heed of wicked tongues janglery,  
For every one in love hath wretches envied.

109

For who-so will of every word take heed,  
Or rule himself by every wight’s wit,  
Shall never thrive, out of dread.  
For that that some men blame ever yet,  
Lo, other manner folk commend it.  
And as for me, for all such variance,  
Happiness I call my sufficiency.

110

For which, withouten any words more,  
To Troy I will, as for conclusion.”  
But God it wot, ere fully months two,  
She was full far from that intention.  
For both Troilus and Troy town  
Shall knottles through-out her heart slide;  
For she will take a purpose for to bide.

111

This Diomede, of whom I told before,  
Goes now, within himself ever arguing  
With all the sleight and all that ever he can,  
How he may best, with shortest tarrying,  
Into his net Cressida’s heart bring.  
To this intent he could never fine;  
To fish her, he laid out hook and line.

But natheless, well in his heart he thought
That she was not without some love in Troy.
For never, since he her from thence had brought,
Could he behold her laugh, or see her joy.
He knew not how her heart to ease or cloy.
“But for to try,” he said, “it shall not grieve;
For he that nothing ventures, nothing will achieve.”

1 13

And so he said unto himself one night,
“Now am I not a fool, that see full well
How her distress is for another wight;
And shall I, now, upon her bosom dwell?
I wot full well, it will not be my spell.
For wise folk in their books this lesson write,
‘Men shall not woo a wight in heaviness.’”

1 14

But who might win so fair a flow’r away
From him for whom she mourns both night and day,
He might well say, he were a conqueror.”

And straight anon, as he that ever dared,
Thought in his heart, “Happen what may befall,
Though I should die, her heart I will assay;
I shall lose nothing save my words most small.”

1 15

This Diomede, as books and tales declare,
Was ready in his needs and courageous;
With stern voice, mighty limbs and square of frame.
Hardy and brave, strong, chevalrous,
Of deeds like to his father Tydeus old;
Some say he was of speech both large and bold;
He was of Calydon and Argos’ fold.

1 16

Cressida was even of her stature,
And of her shape, her face, and eke her cheer;
In all her parts no fairer creature nature
Had framed, that man might ever see or hear.
And oftentimes it was her manner clear
To wear her hair in tresses winding low
Down by her collar at her back, y-plaited so,
Which with a thread of gold she would a-bind.

1 17

And, save her brows that joined at the mind,
There was no blemish that my eye could find;
But to speak of her eyes so bright and clear,
Lo, truly they did write within her sight
That Paradise itself was fashioned there.
And with her rich beauty evermore
Strove Love within her, aye contending sore
Which of them should be more.

1 18

She sober was, and simple, and wise alway,
The best reared that ever might be found;
And goodly of her speech in general,
Charitable, stately, lusty, and free;
Nor ever lacked she pity’s kindly sound;
Tender of heart, slow-moving of courage;
But truly, I can not declare her age.

1 19

And Troilus was waxen well in height,
And fully formed by proportion right
So well, that nature could not mend aright;

1 20

Young, fresh, strong, and hardy as a lion;
True as to steel in every condition;
One of the best endowed creature,
That is, or shall, while that the world may dure.

1 20 (alternate Middle English stanza)

And certainly in story it is found,
That Troilus was never to no wight
In his time in any degree second
In doings that belong to any knight.
Al might a giant pass him in mere might,
His heart was ever like the first and best,
Stood par equal in deeds, to do his best.

1 21

But, for to tellen forth of Diomede: —
It fell that after, on the tenth day
Since that Cressida out of the city yede,
This Diomede, as fresh as bough in May,
Came to the tent where Calchas old did lay,
And feigned him that to Calchas he had to do;
But what he meant, I shall you tell anon.

1 22

Cressida, at short words to tell,
Welcomed him, and down beside her him set;
And he was easy enough to make to dwell.
And after this, withouten long delay,
The spices and the wine men forth hem fet;
And forth they spake of this and that together,
As friends do, of which some shall ye hear.

1 23

He began first upon the war in speech
Betwix them and the folk of Troy town;
And of the siege he did her eke beseech
To tell him what was her opinion.
From that demand he so descended down
To ask her if that her strange thought
The Greeks’ guise, and works that they wrought?

1 24

And why her father tarried so long
To wedde her unto some worthy wight?
Cressida, who was in her pains strong
For love of Troilus, her own knight,
As far forth as she knowledge had or might,
Answered him then; but, as of his intent,
It seemed not she wist what he it meant.

1 25

But natheless, this same Diomede
Gained assurance in himself, and thus he said,
“If I aright have taken heed of you,
Me thinketh thus, O lady mine, Cressida,
That since I first hand upon your bridle laid,
When you came out of Troy upon the morrow,
Never could I see you but in sorrow.

1 26

I can not say what may the cause be,
But if for love of some Trojan it were;
Which right sore would reckon with me,
That I, for any wight that dwelleth there,
Should spill a quarter of a tear,
Or pitifully yourselves so beguile;
For doubtless, it is not worth the while.

1 27

The folk of Troy, as who sayeth, all and some
Are prisoners, and never shall be free,
For out of Troy not one alive shall come,
For all the gold between the sun and sea.
Trust well, and understandeth me,
There shall not one to mercy go alive,
Although he were lord of worlds twice five!

1 28

Such wreche on them for fetching of Eleyne
Shall be taken ere that we hence wend;
That Manes, which be gods of pain,
Shall be aghast that Greeks should them offend;
And men shall dread it to the world’s end,
Henceforth to ravish any queen;
So cruel shall our vengeance on them be seen.

1 29

And but-if Calchas lead us with ambages,
That is to say, with double words sly,
Such as men clepe a ‘word with two visages,’
Ye shall well know that I not lie;
And all this thing right soon ye shall espie,
And that anon; ye will not believe how soon;
Now taketh heed, for it is for to do.

1 30

What wene ye your wise father would
Have given Antenor for you anon,
If he ne wist that the city should
Be destroyed? Why nay, so mot I gon!
He knew full well there shall not scape one
That is Trojan; and for the great fear,
He durst not, ye dwelt longer there.
What will ye more, love-some lady dear?

Let Troy and Trojans from your heart pace!
Drive out that bitter hope, and make good cheer.
And call again the beauty of your face,
That ye with sacked tears so deface.

For Troy is brought in such a jeopardy
That to save it now is no remedy.

1 32

And thenketh well, ye shall in Greeks find
A more perfect love, ere it be night,
Than any Trojan is, and more kind,
And better to serve you will do his might.
And if ye vouchsafe, my lady bright,
I will be he to serve you myself;
Yea, rather than be lord of Greces twelve!

1 33

And with that word he gan to waxen red,
And in his speech a little while he quook,
And cast aside a little while his head,
And stinted awhile; and afterward awook.
And soberly on her he threw his look,
And said, “I am, albeit it you no joy,
As gentle man as any wight in Troy.

1 34

For if my fader Tydeus,” he said,
“Had lived longer, I had been, er this,
Of Calydon and Argos a king, Cressida!
And so hope I that I shall yet, y-wis.
But he was slain, alas! the more harm is,
Unhappily at Thebes all to rathe,
Polynices and many a man to scathe.

1 35

But, lady dear, since now I am your man,
And in my heart you hold the chiefest place,
To serve you as heartily as I can,
And ever shall, while I to live have space,
So, ere that I depart out of this place,
Ye will me grant that I may tomorrow,
At better leisure, tell you of my sorrow.”

1 36

What should I tell the pretty speeches he said?
He spake enough for one day at the least;
It proves well, he spake so that Cressida
Granted, on the morrow, to his request,
To speak with him at the least,
So that he would not speak of such matter;
And thus to him she said, as ye may hear:

1 37

As she that had her heart on Troilus
So fast, that there might it none unlace;
And strangely she spake, and said thus,
“O Diomede, I love that ilke place
Where I was born; and Jove, for his grace,
Deliver it soon from all that doth it care!
God, for thy might, so leave it well to fare!

1 38

That Greeks would wreak their wrath on Troy,
If that they might, I know it well, y-wis.
But it shall not befall as ye do say;
And God forbid that such an altered bliss!
I know my father did to him me sell,
And that he dearly bought me, as ye say;
And for all this, I shall him well repay.

1 39

That Greeks be folk of high condition,
I know eek well; but certes, men shall find
As worthy folk within Troy town,
As cunning, and as perfect and as kind,
As be betwixt the Orkades and Inde.
And that some lady gladly would receive
Your service, that I’m ready to believe.

1 40

But as for love,” she said, and gently sighed,
“I had a lord, and I his wedded wife,
To whom my heart was pledged until he died;
But other love than that in all my life
There hath not been, nor shall I seek love’s strife.
And that you are of high and noble birth,
That have I heard, and know you for your worth.

1 41

And for that reason now I wonder,
That any man should trouble any woman so.
Eek, God wot, love and I be far asunder;
I am disposed, so mote I go,
Until my death, to plain and make my woe.
What I shall after do, I cannot say;
But truly, as yet me list not to play.

1 42

My heart is now in tribulation,
And you in arms are busy day by day.
Hereafter, when you have won the town,
Perchance, then so it happen may,
That when I see that I never ere saw,
Then will I work those things I never wrought.
This word to you enough should suffice.

1 43

Tomorrow eke I will speak with you fain,
So that ye touch nought of this matter;
And when you list, you may come here again;
And, ere you go, thus much I say you here:
As help me Pallas with her hair’s clear sheen,
If that I should of any Greek have ruth,
It should be yourself, by my truth!

1 44

I say not therefore that I will you love,
Nor I say not nay; but in conclusion
I mean well, by God that sits above!” —
And therewithal she cast her eyen down,
And gan to sigh, and said, “O Troy town,
Yet bid I God, in quiet and in rest
I may you see, or do my heart to brest.”

1 45

But in effect, and shortly for to say,
This Diomede all freshly new again
Gan press on, and fast her mercy pray;
And after this, the truth for to say,
Her glove he took, of which he was full fain,
And finally, when it waxed eve,
And all was well, he rose and took his leave.

1 46

The bright Venus followed and aye taught
The way where broad Phoebus down alight;
And Cynthia her chariot-horses over-raught
To whirl out of the Lion, if she might;
And Signifer his candles showed bright.
When that Cressida unto her bed went
Within her father’s fair and shining tent,

1 47

Returning in her soul aye up and down
The words of this sudden Diomede,
His great estate, and peril of the town,
And that she was alone and had great need
Of friend’s help; and thus began to breed
The cause why, the truth for to tell,
That she took fully purpose for to dwell.

1 48

The morrow came, and ghostly for to speak,
This Diomede is come unto Cressida,
And shortly, lest that ye my tale break,
So well he for himself spake and said,
That all her sighs sore down he laid,
And finally, the truth for to say,
He reft her of the great of all her pain.

1 49

And after this the story telleth us,
That she him gave the fair bay steed,
Which once he won of Troilus;
And eke a brooch (and that was little need)
That Troilus was, she gave this Diomede.
And eke, the better from sorrow him to relieve,
She made him wear a pennon of her sleeve.

1 50

I find eke in the stories elsewhere,
When deep wounded once was Diomede
By Troilus, she wept tears manifold
When that she saw his wide wounds bleed;
And that she took to keep him good heed,
And for to heal him of his sorrows smart,
Men say, men say, that she gave him her heart.

1 51

And yet the story also telleth us,
There made never woman more wo
Than she, when that she falsed Troilus.
She said, “Alas! for now is clean ago
My name of troth in love, for ever-mo!
For I have falsed one, the gentlest
That ever was, and one the worthiest!

1 52

Alas, of me unto the world’s end,
Shall neither be written nor be song
No good word, for these books will me shend;
O, rolled shall I be on many a tongue!
Throughout the world my bell shall be rung;
And women most will hate me of all.
Alas, that such a case on me should fall!

1 53

And they will say, in scorning of all this,
That I dishonored them, alack the day!
Though I were not the first that did amiss,
That will not wipe the blot of shame away.
But since what’s done, must so for ever stay,
And since my former guilt I can’t undo,
To Diomede at least I shall be true.

1 54

But Troilus, since I can do no more,
And since our paths henceforth must separate,
May heaven to its favor thee restore!
O Troilus, the best and gentlest mate
Who e’er his heart to love did consecrate,
What other love can stand in thy dear stead!”

She brake, and bitter tears she forth did shed.

1 55

“Of this I’m sure, that I shall hate you never,
A friend’s love you shall have at least of me,
And my good word, though I should live forever!
And truly I should grieve if I should see
You ever fall into adversity.
That you are guiltless, no one need me tell;
God’s will be done! And thus I say farewell!”

1 56

How long a time it was that lay between
Ere she forsook him for bold Diomede,
No author tells, so far as I have seen,
And no man, let him never so widely read,
Shall find a further record of this deed;
But Diomede, though quick enough to woo,
Before he won her, yet more had to do.

1 57

Nor shall I now this woman further chide
Than from her simple story doth arise;
Her name, alas, is published far and wide,
Her guilt is plain enough to all men’s eyes.

---

[120-127 (alternate/translation stanzas)]

But he was wary, since he surely thought
That she had left some love in Troy behind;
For ever since she from that town was brought,
She seemed to carry something on her mind,
Some loss to which she could not be resigned.
“But still,” he said, “to try is worth the pains,
For he who nothing ventures, nothing gains.”

And so he said unto himself one day,
“Now I am not a fool—I see full well
How she is sad because her lover’s away;
If I should press her now, it would not dwell.
I must give time; wise folk in books do tell,
‘Do not make love to those in great distress.’”

“But such a flower for yourself to win
From him for whom she mourneth night and day,
That were a conquest one might pride to pin!”
And boldly then, for he delayed no way,
“Let happen,” he declared, “whatever may;
I’ll try her out, and if she should refuse,
I’ve nothing but a little breath to lose.”

This Diomede, as all the books attest,
Was quick in action, also brave and bold,
And stern of voice, with mighty arms and chest.
For deeds adventurous he was extolled,
High as his father Tydeus of old;
Some say his speech could reach with loftier range—
This prince of Argos and of Calydon strange.

Cressida was even of her stature,
And in her shape, her look, and all her face,
No fairer creature ever blessed man’s sight.
Following custom of her time and place,
She wore her hair braided in a lace,
Down by her collar at her back behind,
And with a thread of gold she did it bind.

Her curving brows beneath her forehead met,
And in all things men counted her most fair;
Her eyes within their frames were brightly set,
And all who saw her with one voice declare
That Paradise in truth was written there;
Beauty and love in her were so create
That which was greater one could but debate.

Sedate she was, simple and wise withal,
Instructed in the arts most carefully,
Goodly of speech, whatever might befall,
With kindly grace, both dignified and free;
Nor lacked her heart in sense of sympathy
In all the things which kindly feeling moves,
But I regret I cannot tell her loves.

And Troilus was more than middle height,
But well-proportioned, of figure neat;
In short, he seemed in everything just right,
Young, fresh, and quick as lion on his feet,
And true as steel his heart within its seat;
He was with all the qualities endowed
That to our human nature are allowed.

In all the histories it is related
That Troilus was never in men’s sight
In lower rank than with the highest rated,
In noble deeds pertaining to a knight;
Though not a giant in his body’s might,
His heart was ever equal to the best
In deeds that knightly competence attest.

But now let us return to Diomede.
The tenth day came since that sad parting day
When to the Greeks this lady he did lead.
And Diomede, fresh as flowers in May,
Came to the tent where wise old Calchas lay,
And feigned that he had business with the priest,
But of his plans, the business was the least.

Now Cressida, in all things neat and nice,
Received him there, and bade him take a seat,
Nor had she any need to ask him twice;
And in the proper way a guest to treat,
Spices and wine she served in manner meet;
In friendly conversation then they fell,
A part of which I shall proceed to tell.

First of the war he then began to speak
Between the Greeks and the besieged at Troy,
And her opinion humbly he did seek
What methods in the siege one should employ;
And then he asked if she did there enjoy
Her life among the Greeks, and if their ways
Seemed strange, and how she passed her further days.

And why her father should delay so long
To marry her unto some good worthy knight.
But Cressida, who felt the pain so strong
For absent Troilus, her heart’s delight,
Gave answer to his questions as she might,
But of his deeper purpose and intent
Perhaps she had no inkling what he meant.

But nevertheless the dauntless Diomede
Pressed bravely on, and this attempt essayed:
“If I have rightly of you taken heed,
Dear Cressida, I’m very much afraid,
Since hand upon your bridle first I laid,
When you came forth from Troy upon that morrow,
You have been sore oppressed by some deep sorrow.

“I cannot say just what the cause may be,
Unless perchance some Trojan you hold dear;
Yet let me say, it truly would grieve me
If you for any Trojan, far or near,
Should ever spill a quarter of a tear,
Or let one smile from off your face depart,
For, Cressida, 'tis not worth while in heart.

“The Trojans, one might say, both all and some,
Are prisoners, and never shall be free;
For out of Troy not one alive shall come
For all the gold between the sun and sea.
Trust well, and understandeth this of me,
There shall not one to mercy go alive,
Although he were the lord of worlds twice five!

“The rape of Helen shall so be repaid,
Ere we upon our homeward way shall wend;
The Manes, gods of pain, shall stand afraid
Lest Grecian wrath with theirs should e’er contend;
And men shall dread it to the world’s end,
Henceforth henceforth to ravish any queen;
Such vengeance on the Trojans shall be seen.

“And but if Calchas lead us with ambages,
That is, with double words of subtle art,
Such as men call a ‘word with two visages,’
Ye shall well know that I do not depart
From truth; and all this ye shall see with your heart,
And that anon; ye will not trow how soon;
Now take good heed, for this is to be done.

“What think ye your wise father would have given
To Antenor for you, if he had known
That the city should be overthrown?
Why, nay—so may I go! He knew full well
There shall not one escape that is Trojan;
And for the great fear he durst not suffer ye
To dwell the longer there. What will ye plea?

“Let Troy and Trojans from your heart be chased!
Drive out that bitter hope, and make good cheer;
And call again the beauty of your face,
Which with the salt of tears you thus deface!
For Troy is brought into such jeopardy
That, to preserve it, is now no remedy.

“And thinketh well, ye shall in Greeks find
A more perfect love, ere long this night befall,
Than any Trojan is, and more kind,
And better to serve you will do his all;
And if ye will vouchsafe me, lady bright,
I will be he to serve you—myself, by right!
Yea rather than be lord of Grece’s might!”

And with that word he blushed a bashful red,
And in his speech his little frame he shook,
And cast aside awhile his heed, and said,
And stinted a short while; then forth he took
A sober look and on her visage look,
And said, “I am, though this to you no joy,
A gentleman as any in this Troy.

“For if my father Tydeus had lived,
I had been ere now of Calydon and Argos king;
And so I hope that yet shall be achieved.
But he was slain—alas!—a grievous thing
At Thebes, where Polynices and his ring
Suffered, and many a knight was done to scathe.”

---

1 35

“But, lady dear, since now I am your man,
And being the first of those from whom I seek grace,
To serve you as heartily as ever I can,
And ever shall, while I have worldly space,
So, ere that I depart out of this place,
Ye will me grant that I may tomorrow,
At better leisure, tell you of my sorrow.”

1 36

What should I tell the words that he there said?
He spake enough for one day at the least;
It proveth well, he spake so that Cressida
Granted on the morrow at his request
To speak with him at the least,
So that he would not speak of such matter;
And thus unto him she said, as ye may hear:

1 37

As she that hadde her heart on Troilus
So fast, that there might it none unlace;
And strangely she spake, and said thus,
“O Diomede, I love that ilke place
Where I was born; and Jove, for his grace,
Deliver it soon from all that doth it care!
God, for thy might, so leave it well to fare!

1 38

That Greeks would wreak their wrath on Troy, I wot;
If that they might, I know it well, y-wis.
But it shall not befall as ye now say;
And God forbid that such ill come to this.
I wot my father is wise and ready his,
And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde;
So dear I am unto him, the more I him holde.

1 39

That Greeks be of high condition I know well;
But for a certainty, men shall finde
As worthy folk within the Trojan town,
As cunning, and as perfect, and as kind,
As be betwixt the Orkades and Inde.
And that ye could well your lady serve,
I trow eke well, her thanks for to deserve.

1 40

But as to speak of love, y-wis,” she said,
“I had a lord, to whom I wedded was,
Whose was my heart wholly, till that he died;
And other love within my heart there nis,
Ne never was—so help me now Pallas.
And that ye be of noble and high kin,
I have well heard it told, out of no sin.

1 41

And that doth me to have such wonder,
That ye wal scorn any woman so.
Eek, God wot, love and I be far asunder;
I am disposed better, so mot I go,
Until my death, to pine and make my woe.
What I shall after do, I can not say;
But truly, as yet me lists not to play.

1 42

My heart is now in tribulation,
And ye in arms busy, day by day;
Hereafter, when ye shall have won the town,
Perchance, then so it happen may,
That when I see what I never ere saw,
Then will I work that I never wrought.
These words to you enough should suffice.

1 43

Tomorrow also will I speak with you fain,
So that ye touch not of this matter more;
And when ye list, you may come here again;
And, ere ye go, thus much I say you here:
As help me Pallas with her hairs clear-sheen,
If I should of any Greek have ruth,
It should be your-self, by my truth!

1 44

I say not therefore that I will you love,
Nor do I say nay; but in conclusion
I mean well, by God that sits above.” —
And therewith she cast her eyes down low,
And gan to sigh, and said, “O Troy town,
Yet pray I God, in quiet and in rest
I may you see, or do my heart to brest.”

1 45

But in effect, and shortly for to say,

Gan press on, and fast her mercy pray;

And yet the story also telleth us,
There made never woman more woe
Than she, when that she falsed Troilus.
She said, “Alas! for now is clean ago
My name of troth in love, for ever-mo!
For I have falsed one, the gentlest
That ever was, and one the worthiest!

1 52

Alas, of me, unto the world’s end,
Shall neither be written nor be song
No good word, for these books will me shend;
O, rolled shall I be on many a tongue;
Throughout the world my bell shall be rung;
And women most will hate me of all.
Alas, that such a case on me should fall!

1 53

And they will say, in scorning of all this,
That I dishonored them, alack the day!
Though I were not first that did amiss,
That will not wipe the blot of shame away.
But since what’s done must so for ever stay,
And since my former guilt I can’t undo,
To Diomede at least I shall be true.

1 54

But Troilus, since I can do no more,
And since our paths henceforth must separate,
May heaven to its favor thee restore!
O Troilus, the best and gentlest mate
Who ever his heart to love did consecrate,
What other love can stand in thy dear stead?”

She brake and bitter tears she then forth shed.

1 55

“I am sure that I shall hate you never,
A friend’s love you shall have at least of me,
And my good word, though I should live forever.
And truly I should grieve if I should see
You ever fall into adversity.
That you are guiltless, no one need me tell;
God’s will be done! And thus I say farewell!”

1 56

How long a time it was that lay between
Ere she forsook him for bold Diomede,
No author tells, so far as I have seen,
And no man, let him never so widely read,
Shall find a further record of this deed;
But Diomede, though quick enough to woo,
Before he won her yet had more to do.

1 57

Nor shall I now this woman further chide
Than from her simple story doth arise;
Her name, alas, is published far and wide,
Her guilt is plain enough to all men’s eyes.

## Modern English Translation

Poor Troilus, as I before have told,  
Now lived along in any way he might,  
But often was his heart now hot, now cold,  
And most of all upon that last ninth night,  
For still he hoped next day his lady bright  
Would come again; but yet he had, God knows,  
Throughout that wakeful night but slight repose.

Phoebus, the laurel-crowned, now shiningly  
Upon his course aye higher upward went  
To warm the wide waves of the eastern sea,  
And Nisus’ daughter sang the day’s advent,  
When Troilus his word for Pandarus sent,  
And on the city walls they walked about,  
To keep for Cressida a far lookout.

Till noon they kept their place and looked to see  
Who came, and every one, they said, as long  
As he was far away, was surely she,  
Till nearer view showed they were always wrong;  
For she was never one in any throng;  
And thus befool’d, this fond expectant pair  
Stand on the Trojan walls and vainly stare.

Said Troilus, “Unless she comes quite soon,  
I must believe she couldn’t get away  
And won’t arrive in town till afternoon.  
No doubt she had enough to do and say  
To win from under her old father’s sway.  
I think, perhaps, he wanted her to dine  
Before she left, and she could not decline.”

Pandar to this replied, “That may well be,  
And let us do the same, I might suggest,  
And then come back, to see what we can see.”  
So home they go and dine and briefly rest,  
Then back again upon their hopeless quest.  
They cannot see, for all their straining eyes,  
That Fortune hides from them a sad surprise.

“It looks,” said Troilus, “as though something  
Has happened, or else her father keeps her so  
She can’t arrive till nearly evening.  
Come on, and to the city gates let’s go!  
These gatemen are such stupid dolts, you know,  
They wouldn’t hesitate to shut the gate  
And keep her out if she chanced to be late.”

The day goes fast, night falls on land and sea,  
And “Cressida, she cometh not,” he said.  
He gazes forth on hedge and grove and tree,  
And from the city wall he hangs his head;  
But still she tarries, still his hopes he fed.  
“I know,” he cried, “what she intends to do!  
Almost I feared that she would prove untrue.

“But now I know just what she doth intend —  
She means to travel here incognito,  
And her good sense therein I must commend.  
She will not make herself a public show,  
But quietly, and so that none may know,  
By night into the town she thenketh ride,  
And her good pleasure we must so abide.”

“In fact there’s nothing else that we can do.  
But Pandar, look! What is it there I see?  
She’s come at last, it’s too good to be true!  
Lift up your eyes, old man! Is not that she?”  
“Well, no,” said Pandarus, “sorry I can’t agree!  
You’re wrong again, my boy; for my part,  
All I can see is some poor farmer’s cart.”

“Too true, it’s but too true,” said Troilus,  
“But still I cannot think it’s all for naught  
That in my heart I feel uplifted thus.  
Some good must be foreshadowed by my thought,  
Since consolation comes to me unsought;  
I never felt such comfort, truth to say,  
And that she’ll come to-night, my life I’ll lay.”

“It may be,” answered Pandar, “well enough,”  
He neither stifled nor denied those hopes,  
Though in his heart he thought them silly stuff;  
And with a straight face to himself he said,  
“You might as well give up and let things slide,  
For all the good you’ll get by waiting here.  
Yes, farewell to the snows of yesteryear!”

The warden of the gates began to call  
The folk without the fosses to prepare  
To drive into the town their cattle all,  
Or through the night they must remain out there;  
And in the dusk, with heart oppressed by care,  
Troilus turns at last homeward to ride,  
For now why should he longer there abide!

But still he took some hope in thinking this,  
That he perhaps had counted wrong the day.  
“I must,” he said, “have taken her amiss,  
For I recall I heard her that night say,  
‘I shall be back again, if so I may,  
Before the silver moon, my own sweetheart,  
Shall pass the Lion and from the Ram depart,’

“And so it may yet turn out for the best.”  
And on the morrow, to the gate he went,  
And up and down, to east and then to west,  
Beyond the city walls his gaze he bent;  
But nothing gained from weary time thus spent,  
And so at night, when he could see no more,  
He went back home in disappointment sore.

Now hope delusive took its final flight,  
For all that he had sought had turned out wrong;  
Upon his heart there fell a deadly blight,  
So were his silent sorrows sharp and strong.  
For when he saw she stayed away so long,  
He dared not to himself either think or say  
Why she should fail to keep her promised day.

The third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth succeed,  
Since the appointed ten days by had rolled,  
And bit by bit the madness of suspicion  
Creeps in; the ill and jealous spirit spake.  
He ate not, drank not, through his melancholy,  
And from all company withdrew and fled;  
Such was the life he led the while he bled.

He grew so wasted that no man could know  
Him as he went; so thin, so pale and wan,  
That by his staff he walked, a feeble show;  
And with his wrath he thus himselfen shent.  
If any asked him where his sorrow sprent,  
He said his harm was all about his heart.

Priam oft questioned, and his mother dear,  
His brethren and his sisters asked likewise,  
Why he stood so sorrowful in his cheer,  
And what the cause of all his grief might be;  
But all in vain — he would not show the key,  
But said he felt a grievous malady  
About his heart, and fain he would die.

So once he laid him down to sleep at last,  
And in that sleep he thought he walked a wood,  
Where for the love of her he loved so fast  
He wept; and wandering up and down he stood,  
There met he in his dream a boar of might,  
All sleeping, lazing in the sun’s clear light.

And by this boar, fast in his arms outspread,  
Lay kissing ever his lady Cressida;  
For sorrow of which sight, waking from bed,  
He rose and cried aloud to Pandarus,  
“O Pandarus, now know I crop and root!  
I am but dead; there is no other boot!

“My lady bright Cressida hath me betrayed,  
In whom I trusted most of any wight.  
Elsewhere her heart has now been fully laid;  
The gods in their high power through the night  
Have in my vision shown me this true sight.  
Thus in my dream Cressida I did behold” —  
And all this thing to Pandarus he told.

“O Cressida, what baseless treachery!  
What new delight, what beauty, what device,  
What wrath—but with what right have you to me?  
What guilt in me, what cunning or device  
Has plucked from me my trust, alas! — thy eyes?  
O trust, O faith, O deep assurance! who  
Hath reft from me my Cressida, my all?”

“Allas! why did I ever let you go?  
By what—oh, by what folly—was I thus tricked?  
What faith on oaths may I henceforth bestow?  
God knows I thought, O lady bright, Cressida,  
That every word you said was gospel true!  
But who may better beguile, if he list,  
Than he on whom a man most trusts and wist?

“What shall I do? What now is left for me?  
A new sharp pain upon my heart doth fall,  
For which no remedy I plainly see.  
Better that I with my own hands should end all,  
Than thus forever live to weep and call.  
By death my wo might have a final cease;  
As long as I live, my life brings no peace.”

Pandarus replied, “Alas, the time I was born!  
Have I not told you oft that dreams beguile?  
And why? Because men’s dreams they misinterpret.  
To charge her false upon a dream’s denial  
Is cowardice, for dreams spring from your fear;  
And what they mean you never may make clear.”

“This dream of yours about a boar, you know,  
May well denote her father, old and hoar,  
Who lies out in the sun, near death’s pale glow,  
And she for sorrow weeps and kisses o’er  
Her aged sire upon the ground before;  
Thus may you well expound your dream aright.”

“How then shall I discover this,” he cried,  
“To know if that be so, though small the chance?”  
“Now wisely speak you,” said his Pandarus;  
“My counsel is, since thou canst well endite,  
Hastily write a letter to her sight,  
By which thou shalt find out, without pretense,  
The truth of that which makes thee sit in suspense.

“For see the point: if she be false indeed,  
I cannot credit she will write again;  
And if she writes, then quickly thou shalt read  
If she hath liberty to come to Troy,  
Or if she be forbidden, in some way,  
She will assign a cause and plainly say.”

He had not written since she went from Troy,  
Nor had she written him — and this I pray,  
May well be for some cause within her thought,  
Which thou perforce shalt deem to be for best  
For both of you. Now write, and thou shalt see  
The truth of all; there is no more to be done.”

Agreed unto this counsel straight are they,  
And Troilus sits down, and all to-day  
Rolls in his heart how best his grief to write,  
And to Cressida, his own lady bright.  
He penned his letter then, and thus did say:

“Right fresh flower, whom I have been and shall  
Withouten part of any other praise,  
With heart, body, life, lust, thought, and all,  
I, wretched wight, in every humble wise  
That tongue can tell or heart devise, devise  
As oft as matter occupieth any place,  
Commend me humbly to your noble grace.

“If it please you to know, sweet heart, how long  
Since you left me in sore pain and distress,  
When that you went, of which I find no throng  
Of comfort yet — but ever worse, I guess —  
From day to day I dwindle and am less;  
While it you please, of weal and woe my well!  
I write, with fearful heart and true, to tell.

“My woe that every hour increaseth new,  
I set in writing as my grief compels.  
These stains upon this paper show it true;  
They are the tears that from mine eyes down-fell,  
That would speak if they could, and would complain as well.  
I first beseech that with your eyes so clear  
You take not this defiled sheet not dear;

> And over all, my lady, deign to view  
> This letter, and by cause of my cold cares  
> — that slay my wit, if aught awry me fares —  
> Forgive it me, my own sweet heart, I pray.

If any servant daringly or right  
Might pitifully on his lady complain,  
Then surely I were that unhappy wight;  
Consider this — for months twain you remain  
Abroad, though you said ten days you would remain;  
Yet in two months you do not yet return.

But since in all things I must yield to you,  
I dare not further on this matter plead,  
But humbly, with full many a sorrowing sigh,  
I write my unrest and afflictions sore,  
From day to day desiring evermore  
To know it fully, if your will it were,  
How you have fared and what you have done there.

Your welfare and your health, God prosper them;  
And may your honour ever upward climb,  
So that it never cease to grow and stem;  
As your free heart deviseth, so I pray:  
And grant that you on me will soon look ay  
With pity as I am to you so true.

And if you willed to learn how here I fare,  
Whose woes at present reach their height and knife,  
I can but say — borne onward by my care —  
When I this wrote I yet remained alive,  
Yet ready, to receive swift death, to connive  
If it prevail; but still I hold it off,  
Till I may see what word from you I doff.

My eyes, now useless to behold your face,  
Are but two bitter wells of flowing tears;  
My song is but my own adversity;  
My happy heavens have turned to bitter spheres,  
And no relief my weight of woe can pierce;  
I am my own accursed adversary,  
And every joy is turned to misery.

But when you come again to Troy once more,  
All this affliction you shall quickly heal,  
For then indeed you shall revive my store;  
For never yet did heaven a heart so bless  
As you shall mine, when all my long distress  
Shall have an end; if not by pity stirred,  
At least by duty keep the vows you heard.

“But if I’ve earned such fate through any wrong,  
Or if my face you never more will see,  
In mere reward that I have served you long,  
I beg that you be frank and free with me...”

> And quickly write and send word back to me,
> And tell me so, my only lodestar bright,
> That I may end my life in death and night.
>
> “Or if some other cause makes you to dwell,
> Then in your letter make of this report,
> For though to me your absence is a hell,
> My woe to needful patience can resort,
> And hope against my black despair retort.
> Pray write then, sweet, and make the matter plain,
> With hope, or death, deliver me from pain!
>
> “But I must warn you, my own sweetheart true,
> When you again your Troilus shall see,
> So much has changed his frame and all his hue,
> That Cressida shall scarcely know it’s he.
> In truth, light of my world, my lady free,
> So thirsts my heart your beauty to behold,
> My grasp on life I scarce can longer hold.
>
> “I say no more, though more I well could write,
> And still leave boundless volumes yet to say;
> With life or death my love you may requite,
> Yet heaven grant you joy in every way!
> So fare thee well, my love, and have good day!
> My life or death I take as you shall send,
> And to your truth myself I still commend,
>
> “With such good will, that if you grant to me
> The same good will, there’s nothing else I crave;
> For in you lies, if so you’ll have it be,
> The doom that men shall dig for me my grave,
> Or in you lies the might my life to save,
> And bid all grief and pain from me depart!
> And now a last farewell, my own sweetheart!
>
> *Le vostre T.*

## BOOK V

### Modern English

204  
This letter forth was sent unto Cressida,  
Of which her answer in effect was this:  
Full pitifully she wrote again, and said  
That also soon as that she might, y-wis,  
She would come, and amend all that was amiss.  
And finally she wrote and said to him then  
She would come, yea, but she wist not when.

205  
But in her letter made she such feasts,  
That wonder was, and swore she loved him best,  
Of which he found but bottomless behests.  
But Troilus, thou mayst now, east or west,  
Pipe in an ivy leaf, if that thee lest;  
Thus goeth the world; God shield us fro mischance,  
And every wight that meaneth truth advance!

206  
Increase began the woe from day to night  
Of Troilus, for tarrying of Cressida;  
And lessen began his hope and eke his might,  
For which all down he in his bed him laid;  
He ne ate, ne drank, ne slept, ne word he said,  
Imagining aye that she was unkind;  
For which well nigh he wax out of his mind.

207  
This dream, of which I told have eke before,  
May never come out of his remembrance;  
He thought aye well he hadde his lady lorn,  
And that Jove, of his purveyance,  
Him showed hadde in sleep the significance  
Of her untrouth and his disaventure,  
And that the boar was showed him in figure.

208  
For which he for Sibyl his sister sent,  
That called was Cassandra eke al about;  
And all his dream he told her er he stent.  
And her besought to absolve him the doubt  
Of the strong boar, with tusks stoute;  
And finally, within a little stounde,  
Cassandra him gan right thus his dream expounde.

209  
She gan first smile, and said, “O brother dear,  
If thou a sooth of this desirest know,  
Thou must a fewe of old stories hear,  
To purpose, how that fortune overthrow  
Hath lords old; through which, within a throwe,  
Thou well this boar shalt know, and of what kind  
He comen is, as men in books finde.

210  
“Diana, which that wroth was and in ire  
For Greeks nolde doon her sacrifice,  
Ne incense upon her altar sette afire,  
She, for that Greeks gonne her so despise,  
Wrak her in a wonder cruel wise.  
For with a boar as great as ox in stall  
She made up frete her corn and vines all.

211  
“To slay this boar the country-side was raised,  
Amonges which there came, this boar to see,  
A maiden, one of this world the best y-praysed;  
And Meleager, lord of that country,  
So loved this maiden, fair and fresh and free,  
That into battle with this boar he went,  
And killing it, its head unto her sent.

212  
“From this, as ancient writers tell to us,  
There rose a contest and a warfare high.  
And from this lord descended Tydeus,  
By line direct, as no one can deny;  
But how this Meleager came to die  
Through his own mother, that I shall not tell,  
For on that tale it were too long to dwell.”

213  
How Tydeus made warfare, Sibyl told,  
At Thebes, that ancient city and so strong,  
Maintaining that to Polynices bold  
The Theban city did by right belong,  
And that Eteocles, his brother, wrong  
Had done, in holding Thebes by strength—  
All this she told to him and at great length.

214  
She also told about Haemonides,  
When Tydeus slew fifty knights so stout,  
And told of all the wondrous prophecies,  
And how the seven kings for Thebes set out,  
And then besieged the city round about,  
And of the holy serpent and the well,  
And of the Furies, all this did she tell;

215  
And Archemorus’ death and funeral plays,  
And how Amphiorax fell through the ground,  
How Tydeus was slain and closed his days,  
And also how Ipomedon was drowned,  
And Parthenope final death wound found,  
And how Capaneus, the strong and proud,  
Was slain by stroke of thunder, sounding loud.

216  
And then she told the tale how either brother,  
Eteocles and Polynices true,  
How each of them in skirmish killed the other,  
And how Argia wept and made ado;  
The burning of the town did she review,  
And so descended down from stories old  
To Diomede, and of him thus she told.

217  
“This boar you dreamed of stands for Diomede,  
Tydeus’ son, of Meleager’s line,  
Who killed the boar and won fame by that deed;  
Thy lady, if in fact she once was thine,  
With Diomede in love doth now combine;  
Be glad or sad, but there can be no doubt,  
This Diomede is in and you are out.”

218  
“That isn’t true,” he cried, “thou sorceress!  
False is the spirit of thy prophecy,  
And all the priestly cunning you profess!  
Your wickedness is plain and clear to see,  
To stain a lady’s name with falsity!  
Away,” he cried, “may Jove increase your sorrow,  
For you are false today and false tomorrow!

219  
“As well defame the beautiful Alcestis,  
That was of creatures kindest and the best;  
For when her husband was in jeopardy  
To die himself, unless she would die,  
She chose for him to die and go to hell,  
And starved anon, as us the books do tell.”

220  
Cassandra goes, and he with cruel heart  
For-yet his woe, for anger of her speech;  
And from his bed all suddenly he start,  
As though all whole him hadde y-mad a leech.  
And day by day he gan enquire and seek  
A sooth of this, with all his fulle cure;  
And thus he drieth forth his adventure.

221  
Fortune, which that permutation  
Of things hath, as it is her committed  
Through purveyance and disposition  
Of high Jove, as kingdoms shall be flitted  
From folk to folk, or when they shall be smitten,  
Gan pull away the feathers bright of Troy  
From day to day, til they ben bare of joy.

222  
Among all this, the end of Hector’s parody  
Of Hector gan approachen wonder blyth;  
The fate would his soul should unbody.  
And shapen hadde a mean it out to drive;  
Against which fate him helpeth not to strive;  
But on a day to fighten gan he wend,  
At which, alas! he caught his life’s end.

223  
For which me thinketh every maner wight  
That haunteth arms ought to bewail  
The death of him that was so noble a knight;  
For as he drew a king by the aventail,  
Unwar of this, Achilles through the mail  
And through the body gan him for to rive;  
And thus this worthy knight was brought of life.

224  
For whom, as old books tellen us,  
Was made such woe, that tongue it may not tell;  
And namely, the sorrow of Troilus,  
That next him was of worthiness a well.  
And in this woe gan Troilus to dwell,  
That, what for sorrow, and love, and for unrest,  
Full oft a day he bad his heart brest.

225  
But natheless, though he gan him despair,  
And dread ay that his lady was untrue,  
Yet ay on her his heart gan repaire.  
And as these lovers do, he sought aye new  
To get again Cressida, bright of hue.  
And in his heart he went her excusing,  
That Calchas caused all her tarrying.

226  
And oftentimes he was in purpose great  
Himself to liken like a pilgrim to disguise  
To see her; but he may not counterfeit  
To be unknown of folk that were wise,  
Nor find excuse aright that may suffice  
If he among the Greeks known were;  
For which he wept full ofte many a tear.

227  
To Cressida he often wrote anew,  
For not the faintest chance he would neglect,  
Beseeching her that since he still was true,  
His love, long proved, she should not thus reject;  
And Cressida, for pity, I suspect,  
Wrote him, as I shall tell, a parting word,  
Which was the last he ever from her heard:

228  
“Thou son of Cupid, model of all that’s good,  
Thou sword of knighthood, valor’s primal source.  
Pray how may she who long herself hath stood  
In torment, sorrow from thy heart divorce?  
Behold me, sad and sick, with no recourse,  
Since you with me nor I with you may deal,  
But helpless grief within me to conceal.

229  
“Your letters ample and your paper plaints  
Have deeply moved my heart to sympathy;  
The stains of tears that broke their long restraints,  
These have I seen, but what you ask of me,  
To come to Troy, just now that cannot be,  
Yet why, since someone may this letter seize,  
I cannot here explain to you with ease.

230  
“Grievous to me, God knows, is your unrest,  
And what the Gods have ordered and ordained,  
It seems you take it not as for the best,  
And all the thought you have in mind retained  
Is but of present pleasure unrestrained;  
But for all that, I say ’tis only fear  
Of wicked tongues that makes me linger here.

231  
“For I have heard things much to my surprise  
Concerning you and me, and how we stand,  
Which calls for cautious action and for wise;  
And I have heard that you have merely planned  
To hold me at your beck and your command;  
But let that pass—I can but in you see  
All truth, and gentleness and honesty.

232  
“Yes, I will come! But times are out of joint,  
And as things stand with me, what year or day  
That this shall be, I cannot now appoint.  
But still, whatever happens, let me pray  
To have your goodwill and your friendship aye;  
For truly while my living days endure,  
My friendship to you I do here assure.
>
> “And I must ask you that you do not take  
> It ill, if I so briefly to you write;  
> I dare not, where I am, distrust awake,  
> Nor ever had I skill well to endite.  
> Brief words may cover more than meets the sight.  
> The meaning counts, and not the letters’ space.
>
> So fare you well! God grant to you his grace!  
> *La vostre C.*”

233  
This letter Troilus thought rather strange,  
And read it with a sad and thoughtful sigh,  
For therein saw he many signs of change,  
But finally he could not well believe  
That she would not him hold that she had hieved;  
For with full evil will list him to leave  
That loveth well, in such case, though him greve.

235  
But natheless, men say that, at the last,  
For anything, men shall the truth seek;  
And such a case befell, and that as fast,  
That Troilus well understood that she  
Was not so kind as that her ought to be.  
And finally he wist now out of doubt  
That all is lost that he hath been about.

236  
Stood one day in his melancholy  
This Troilus, and in suspicion  
Of her for whom he wende for to die.  
And so befell, that throughout Troy town,  
As was the guise, was borne up and down  
A manner cote-armure, as saith the story,  
Before Deiphobus, in sign of his victory,

237  
The which cote, as telleth Lollius,  
Deiphobus it hadde y-rent from Diomede  
The same day; and when this Troilus  
It saw, he gan to take of it heed,  
Avising of the length and of the breadth,  
And of all the work; but as he gan behold,  
Full sodeinly his heart gan to cold.

238  
As he that on the collar found within  
A brooch, that he Cressida gave that morrow  
That she from Troy moste needes twinn,  
In remembrance of him and of his sorrow:  
And she him laid again her faith to borrow  
To keep it aye; but now, full well he wiste,  
His lady was no longer on to triste.

239  
He gooth him home, and gan full sone send  
For Pandarus; and all this new chance,  
And of this brooch, he told him word and end,  
Complaininge of her heartes variance,  
His long love, his trouthe, and his penance;  
And after death, withouten words more,  
Full faste he cried, his reste him to restore.

240  
Then spake he thus, “O lady mine Cressida,  
Where is your faith, and where is your behest?  
Where is your love, where is your truth?” he said:  
“O Diomede have ye now all this feast!  
Alas, I would have trowed at the least,  
That, since ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,  
That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!

241  
Who shall now trow on any othes mo?  
Alas, I never would have wend, ere this,  
That ye, Cressida, could have changed so;  
Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis,  
So cruel wend I not your heart, y-wis.  
To selle me thus; alas, your name of trouthe  
Is now for-doon, and that is all my routhe.

242  
Was there none other brooch ye liste lete?

This lettre forth was sent un-to Criseyde,  
Of which hir answere in effect was this;

And that the boor was shewed him in figure.

208  
For which he for Sibille his suster sente,  
That called was Cassandre eek al aboute;  
And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente.  
And hir bisoughte assoilen him the doute  
Of the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute;  
And fynally, with-inne a litel stounde,  
Cassandre him gan right thus his dreem expounde.

209  
She gan first smyle, and seyde, “O brother dere,  
If thou a sooth of this desyrest knowe,  
Thou most a fewe of olde stories here,  
To purpos, how that fortune overthrow  
Hath lordes olde; through which, within a throwe,  
Thou wel this boor shalt knowe, and of what kinde  
He comen is, as men in bokes finde.

210  
Diane, which that wrooth was and in ire  
For Grekes nolde doon hir sacrifyse,  
Ne encens up-on hir auter sette afyre,  
She, for that Grekes gonne hir so dispyse,  
Wrak hir in a wonder cruel wyse.  
For with a boor as greet as oxe in stalle  
She made up frete hir corn and vynes alle.

211  
To slee this boor was al the contree reysed,  
Amonges which ther com, this boor to see,  
A mayde, oon of this world the best y-preysed;  
And Meleagre, lord of that contree,  
He lovede so this fresshe mayden free  
That with his manhod, er he wolde stente,  
This boor he slow, and hir the heed he sente.

212  
Of which, as olde bokes tellen us,  
Ther roos a contek and a greet evvy;  
And of this lord descended Tydeus  
By ligne, or elles olde bokes lye;  
But how this Meleagre gan to dye  
Thorugh his moder, wol I yow not telle,  
For al to long it were for to dwelie.

213  
She tolde eek how Tydeus, er she stente,  
Un-to the stronge citee of Thebes,  
To cleyme kingdom of the citee, wente,  
For his felawe, daun Polynices,  
Of which the brother, daun Eteocles,  
Ful wrongfully of Thebes held the strengthe;  
This tolde she by proces, al by lengthe.

214  
She tolde eek how Hemonides asterte,  
Whan Tydeus slough fifty knightes stoute.  
She tolde eek al the prophesyes by herte,  
And how that sevene kinges, with hir route,  
Bisegeden the citee al aboute;  
And of the holy serpent, and the welle,  
And of the furies, al she gan him telle.

215  
Of Archimoris burying and the pleyes,  
And how Amphiorax fil through the grounde,  
How Tydeus was slayn, lord of Argeyes,  
And how Ypomodoun in litel stounde  
Was dreint, and deed Parthonope of wounde;  
And also how Cappaneus the proude  
With thonder-dint was slayn, that cryde loude.

216  
She gan eek telle him how that either brother,  
Eteocles and Polymite also,  
At a scarmyche, eche of hem slough other;  
And of Argives wepinge and hir wo;  
And how the town was brent she tolde eek tho.  
And so descendeth doun from gestes olde  
To Diomede, and thus she spak and tolde.

217  
“This ilke boor bitokneth Diomede,  
Tydeus sone, that doun descended is  
Fro Meleagre, that made the boor to blede.  
And thy lady, wher-so she be, y-wis,  
This Diomede hir herte hath, and she his.  
Weep if thou wolt, or leef; for, out of doute,  
This Diomede is inne, and thou art oute.”

218  
“Thou seyst nat soth,” quod he, “thou sorceresse,  
With al thy false goost of prophesye!  
Thou wenest been a greet devyneresse;  
Now seestow not this fool of fantasye  
Peyneth hir on ladyes for to lye?  
Awey,” quod he, “ther Joves yeve thee sorwe!  
Thou shalt be fals, paraunter, yet to-morwe!

219  
As wel thou mightest lyen on Alceste,  
That was of creatures kindest and the beste.  
For whanne hir housbonde was in jupartye  
To dye him-self, but-if she wolde dye,  
She chees for him to dye and go to helle,  
And starf anoon, as us the bokes telle.”

220  
Cassandre goth, and he with cruel herte  
For-yat his wo, for angre of hir speche;  
And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte,  
As though al hool him hadde y-mad a leche.  
And day by day he gan enquere and seche  
A sooth of this, with al his fulle cure;  
And thus he dryeth forth his aventure.

221  
Fortune, whiche that permutacioun  
Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed  
Through purveyaunce and disposicioun  
Of heighe Jove, as regnes shal ben flitted  
Fro folk in folk, or whan they shal ben smitted;  
Gan pulle awey the fetheres brighte of Troye  
Fro day to day, til they ben bare of joye.

222  
Among al this, the fyn of the parodie  
Of Ector gan approchen wonder blyve;  
The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie.  
And shapen hadde a mene it out to dryve;  
Ayeins which fate him helpeth not to stryve;  
But on a day to fighten gan he wende,  
At which, alais! he caughte his lyves ende.

223  
For which me thinketh every maner wight  
That haunteth armes oughte to biwayle  
The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;  
For as he drough a king by th’aventayle,  
Unwar of this, Achilles through the mayle  
And through the body gan him for to ryve;  
And thus this worthy knight was brought of lyve.

224  
For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,  
Was maad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;  
And namely, the sorwe of Troilus,  
That next him was of worthinesse welle.  
And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,  
That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,  
Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste.

225  
But natheles, though he gan him dispeyre,  
And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe,  
Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeyre.  
And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe  
To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe.  
And in his herte he wente hir excusinge,  
That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.

226  
And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete  
Him-selven lyk a pilgrim to disgyse  
To seen hir; but he may not contrefete  
To been unknowen of folk that weren wyse,  
Ne finde excuse aright that may suffyse  
If he among the Grekes knowen were;  
For which he wept ful ofte many a tere.

227  
To hir he wroot yet ofte tyme al newe,  
Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slowthe,  
Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe,  
She wolde come ayein and holden hir trouthe.  
For which Criseyde up-on a day, for routhe,  
I take it so, touchinge al this matere,  
Wrot him ayein, and seyde as ye may here.

228  
“Cupydes sone, ensample of goodlihede,  
O swerd of knighthod, sours of gentilesse!  
How mighte a wight in torment and in drede  
And helelees, yow sende as yet gladnesse?  
I hertelees, I syke, I in distresse;  
Sin ye with me, nor I with yow may dele,  
Yow neither sende ich herte may nor hele.

229  
Your lettres ful, the papir al y-pleynted,  
Conseyved hath myn hertes pietee;  
I have eek seyn with teres al depeynted  
Your lettre, and how that ye requeren me  
To come ayein, which yet ne may not be.  
But why, lest that this lettre founden were,  
No mencioun ne make I now, for fere.

230  
Grevous to me, god woot, is your unreste,  
Your haste, and that, the goddes ordenaunce.  
It semeth not ye take it for the beste.  
Nor other thing nis in your remembraunce  
As thinketh me, but only your plesaunce.  
But beth not wrooth, and that I yow biseche;  
For that I tarie, is al for wikked speche.

231  
For I have herd wel more than I wende,  
Touchinge us two, how thinges han y-stonde;  
Which I shal with dissimulinge amende.  
And beth nought wrooth, I have eek understonde  
How ye ne doon but holden me in honde.  
But now no fors, I can not in yow gesse  
But alle trouthe and alle gentilesse.

232  
Comen I wol, but yet in swich disjoynte  
I stonde as now, that what yeer or what day  
That this shal be, that can I not apoynte.  
But in effect, I prey yow, as I may,  
Of your good word and of your friendship ay.  
For trewely, whyl that my lyf may dure,  
As for a freend, ye may in me assure.

233  
Yet preye I yow on yvel ye ne take,  
That it is short which that I to yow wryte;  
I dar not, ther I am, wel lettres make.  
Ne never yet ne coude I wel endyte.  
Eek greet effect men wryte in place lyte.  
Th’entente is al, and nought the lettres space;  
And fareth now wel, god have you in his grace!  
La vostre C.”

234  
This Troilus this lettre thoughte al straunge.  
Whan he it saugh, and sorwefully he sighte;  
Him thoughte it lyk a kalendes of chaunge;  
But fynally, he ful ne trowen mighte  
That she ne wolde him holden that she highte;  
For with ful yvel wil list him to leve  
That loveth wel, in swich cas, though him greve.

235  
But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste,  
For any thing, men shal the sothe seke;  
And swich a cas bitidc, and that as faste,  
That Troilus wel understood that she  
Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be.  
And fynally, he woot now, out of doute,  
That al is lost that he hath been aboute.

236  
Stood on a day in his malencolye  
This Troilus, and in suspecioun  
Of hir for whom he wende for to dye.  
And so bifel, that through-out Troye toun,  
As was the gyse, y-bore was up and doun  
A maner cote-armure, as seyth the storie,  
Bifore Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,

237  
The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius,  
Deiphebe it hadde y-rent from Diomede  
The same day; and whan this Troilus  
It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,  
Avysing of the lengthe and of the brede.  
And al the werk; but as he gan biholde,  
Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde.

238  
As he that on the coler fond withinne  
A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe  
That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,  
In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe:  
And she him leyde ayein hir feyth to borwe  
To keep it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste,  
His lady nas no lenger on to triste.

239  
He gooth him hoom, and gan ful sone sende  
For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,  
And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,  
Compleyninge of hir hertes variaunce,  
His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce;  
And after deeth, with-outen wordes more,  
Ful faste he cryde, his reste him to restore.

240  
Than spak he thus, “O lady myn Criseyde,  
Wher is your feth, and wher is your bihcste?  
Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe?” he seyde:  
“O Diomede have ye now al this feste!  
Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste,  
That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,  
That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!

241  
Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?  
Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this,  
That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;  
Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis,  
So cruel wende I not your herte, y-wis.  
To sele me thus; alias, your name of trouthe  
Is now for-doon, and that is al my routhe.

242  
Was ther non other broche yow liste lete?

### Modern English (continued)

242  
Was there no other brooch you chose to let  
Remain upon your neck that I might see?  
Yet to himself he continued to denote  
That she her faith and name would falsify.  
I love verily, how their ladies grieve  
That they are false—what lover can believe!

235  
But ever must a time come at the last  
When truth will out for every man to see;  
For now the day approaches, sure and fast,  
When Troilus must realize that she  
Was not as constant as she ought to be,  
And that the love and faith that seemed so sure  
Were not so true that they could long endure.

236  
One day he stood in melancholy thought,  
For now his doubts of her he could not down,  
But still they came unchallenged and unsought;  
When through the length of all the Trojan town,  
As happened oft with trophies of renown,  
Before Deiphobus for all to see  
An armor cloak was borne in victory.

237  
This cloak, as Lollius explains to us,  
Deiphobus had torn from Diomede  
The same day; and when this Troilus  
It saw, he gan to take of it heed,  
Avising of the length and of the breadth,  
And of the work; but as he gan behold,  
Full suddenly his heart gan to cold.

238  
For on the collar lay hid there within  
A brooch which he to Cressida had given  
Ere she left Troy, and on her breast did pin,  
In witness of his love with sorrow riven;  
And she an equal faith to show had striven,  
And pledged to keep it aye; but now he knew  
That to her word and him she was untrue.

239  
He hastened home, and straight for Pandarus sent,  
And told him all this new mischance at length,  
And of this brooch, and of his lady's variance;  
Complaining of her heart's unsteady sort,  
His long love, his troth, and his deep hurt;  
And, after death, withouten words more,  
Full fast he cried, his rest to him restore.

> Recounting to him all the sad details  
> About the fatal brooch and what it meant;  
>  
> His lady’s falsity he then bewails  
> Against which love nor honor aught avails,  
>  
> For death alone can heal this wound so sore,  
>  
> And peace unto his shattered heart restore.

To feffe with your newe love," quod he,  
"But thilke broche that I, with teres wete,  
Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me?  
Non other cause, alas, ne hadde ye  
But for despit, and eke for that ye mente  
Al-outrely to shewen your entente!

Through which I see that clene out of your minde  
Ye han me cast, and I ne can nor may,  
For al this world, with-in myn herte finde  
T' unloven yow a quarter of a day!  
In cursed tyme I born was, woe is me!  
That ye, that doon me al this wo endure,  
Yet love I best of any creature.

Now God," quod he, "me sende yet the grace  
That I may meten with this Diomede!  
And trewely, if I have might and space,  
Yet shal I make, I hope, his sydes blede.  
O God," quod he, "that oughtest taken hede  
To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punyce,  
Why niltow doon a vengeaunce on this vyce?

O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste  
Me blamed hast, and wont art ofte upbreyde.  
Now maystow see thy-selve, if that thee liste,  
How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde!  
In sondry formes, God it woot," he seyde,  
"The Goddes shewen bothe joye and tene  
In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.

And certaynly, with-oute more speche,  
From hennes-forth, as ferforth as I may,  
Myn owene deeth in armes wol I seche;  
I recche not how sone be the day!  
But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,  
Whom I have ay with al my might y-served,  
That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved."

This Pandams, that alle these thinges herde,  
And wiste wel he seyde a sooth of this,  
He nought a word ayein to him answerde;  
For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,  
And shamed, for his nece hath doon a-mis;  
And stant, astoned of these causes tweye,  
As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.

But at the laste thus he spak, and seyde,  
"My brother dere, I may thee do no-more.  
What shulde I seyn? I hate, y-wis, Criseyde!  
And God wot, I wol hate hir evermore!  
And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore,  
Havinge un-to myn honour ne my reste  
Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste.

If I dide ought that mighte lyken thee,  
It is me leef; and of this treson now,  
God woot, that it a sorwe is un-to me!  
And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow,  
Right fayn wolde I amende it, wiste I how.  
And fro this world, almighty God I preye,  
Delivere hir sone; I can no-more seye."

>  
> 252
>  
> And oftentimes these two opponents met,  
> With bloody strokes and with exchange of speech;  
> Spear against spear they often thus did whet,  
>  
> Yet neither pierced so deeply as to reach  
> The other’s life, so matched was each to each;  
> This neat exchange blind Fortune would not send  
> That either one the other’s life should end.  
>  
> 253
>  
> And if my purpose here had been to write  
> The arms of Troilus, and not the man,  
> Then could I of his battles much endite;  
> But of his love I’ve told since I began,  
> And shall continue so, as best I can.  
> His deeds of arms, if you would of them hear,  
> Read Dares, where they all in full appear.  
>

> O gentle ladies all, so bright of hue,  
> Let me beseech, although it had to be  
> That I should write of one who was untrue,  
> Put not the blame for what she did on me,  
> For all the books tell her iniquity;  
> Penelope the true, if I but could,  
> I’d rather praise, or fair Alceste the good.  
>  
> 255
>  
> And O ye men, of you naught need be said,  
> Except that ladies’ men have oft betrayed!  
> Bad luck to them and curses on their head,  
> Who with feigned words and plots so subtly laid  
> On simple minds their evil tricks have played!  
> Beware of wiles, O ladies, and take heed,  
> What lesson in my story you may read.  
>  
> 256
>  
> Go, little book, my little tragedy!  
> God grant thy maker, ere his ending day,  
> May write some tale of happy poetry!  
> But, little book, of any poet’s lay  
> Envy of heart here shalt thou not display,  
> But kiss the steps where pass through ages spacious,  
> *Virgil* and *Ovid*, *Homer*, *Lucan*, and *Statius*.  
>  
> 257
>  
> And since there is so great diversity  
> In English, and in the writing of our tongue,  
> I pray to God that no man miswrite thee,  
> Or get thy meter wrong and all unstrung;  
> But everywhere that thou art read or sung,  
> I trust all men will take thee as they should —  
>  
> But now to come back where my story stood.

> 258
>  
> The wrath of Troilus, as I have said,  
> The Grecian warriors had to pay for dear,  
> And hosts of Greeks his valiant hand struck dead;  
> Though in his time he was without a peer  
> Within the city, yet the fatal spear  
> Of bold Achilles, as the gods had willed,  
> At early last this Trojan hero killed.  
>  
> 259
>  
> And when his final earthly breath he drew,  
> His spirit from his body lightly went,  
> And to the eighth sphere’s hollow concave flew,  
> Leaving in convex every element,  
>  
> And then he saw, in glorious ascent,  
> The wandering stars, and heard the harmony  
> Of all the spheres in heavenly melody.  
>  
> 260
>  
> And down from thence he cast his spirit’s eyes  
> Upon this spot of earth, that with the sea  
> Is bound, and now doth heartily despise  
> This wretched world, with all its vanity,  
>  
> In contrast with the joy in full degree  
> Of heaven above; and at the very last  
> His gaze where he was slain, he downward cast.  
>  
> 261
>  
> Silently he laughed to see the grief and woe  
> Of those who weep within this earthly space,  
> Renouncing all men’s works, who only know  
> Those earthly joys which time shall soon efface;  
>  
> In peace content with heaven’s lasting grace,  
> His way he went, in rest no tongue can tell,  
> Where Mercury appointed him to dwell.  
>  
> 262
>  
> Thus ended, lo, the love of Troilus,  
> Thus ended, lo, this model of mankind;  
> His royal rank led to such end, and thus  
> Ended his high nobility of mind,  
> For this false world, so mutable and blind.  
>  
> ’Twas thus his love for Cressida began,  
> And thus until he died its full course ran.  
>  
> 263
>  
> Ye youth, so happy at the dawn of life,  
> In whom love springs as native to your days,  
> Estrange you from the world and its vain strife,  
> And let your hearts their eyes to him upraise  
> Who made you in his image! Give him praise,  
>  
> And think this world is but a passing show,  
> Fading like blooms that all too briefly blow.  
>  
> 264
>  
> And love ye him who on the cross did buy  
> Our souls from timeless death to live for aye,  
> Who died and rose and reigns in heaven high!  
> Your deepest love his love will ne’er betray,  
> Your faith on him I bid you safely lay;  
>  
> And since his love is best beyond compare,  
> Love of the world deny with all its care.  
>  
> 265
>  
> Here, lo, the vanity of pagan rites!  
> Lo, here, how little all their shrines avail!  
> Lo, here the end of worldly appetites!  
>  
> That thou be understonde I God beseche!  
> But yet to purpos of my rather speche. —
