# Volume 13 - Virgil

## VIRGIL (70-19 B.C.)

Publius Vergilius Maro, known as Virgil, is the greatest poet of ancient Rome. His works established the standard for Latin poetry and profoundly influenced Western literature for two millennia.

### Works in This Volume

- **Eclogues** (Bucolics) - Ten pastoral poems exploring themes of love, loss, and the tension between rural peace and political upheaval. The Fourth Eclogue, with its prophecy of a golden age, was later interpreted as foretelling the birth of Christ.

- **Georgics** - A didactic poem in four books on agriculture, celebrating the Italian countryside and the virtues of rural labor. Beyond farming advice, it meditates on humanity's relationship with nature, work, and death.

- **Aeneid** - The epic of Rome's founding, following the Trojan hero Aeneas from the fall of Troy to Italy, where his descendants would found Rome. A national epic that explores duty, fate, sacrifice, and the cost of empire.
