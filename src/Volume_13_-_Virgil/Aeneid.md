# The Aeneid

## Book I

Of arms I sing, and of the man who first
From Trojan shores beneath the ban of fate
To Italy and coasts Lavinian came,
Much tossed about on land and ocean he
By violence of the gods above, to sate
Relentless Juno's ever-rankling ire,
In war, too, much enduring, till what time
A city he might found him, and bear safe
His gods to Latium, whence the Latin race,
And Alba's sires, and lofty-towering Rome.
Say, Muse, what outrage to her power the cause,
Or angered why, the Queen of Heaven constrained
A man, so marked for goodness, still to ply
The round of peril, bear the brunt of toil:
In heavenly breasts do such fierce passions dwell?

There was an ancient city, the abode
Of Tyrian settlers, Carthage, far to sea
Facing Italia and the Tiber-mouths,
Wealthy of substance, and in war's pursuit
None fiercer, far beyond all lands, 'tis said,
To Juno dearest—Samos' self less dear.
Here were her arms, her chariot here; that this
Should, fate consenting, a world-empire be,
Even then the goddess aimed with fond desire.
Natheless she had heard that from the blood of Troy
A race was rearing, destined to o'erthrow
Her Tyrian towers; that issuing hence should come
A people of wide empire, lords of war,
To ravage Libya: such the round of fate.
Moved by this fear, Saturnia, and therewith
Still mindful of the former strife, which erst
At Troy for her dear Argos she had waged—
Nor were the quarrel's causes and fierce pangs
Yet banished from her soul; in memory's depth
Lie stored the doom of Paris, and the affront
Of her spurned beauty, and that loathed stock,
And the high prize of ravished Ganymede—
Fired with these thoughts besides, the Trojan few,
'Scaped from the Danai and Achilles fell,
Still must she keep upon wide ocean tossed
Aloof from Latium; and for many a year
They roamed, fate-driven, through all the circling seas:
So vast the toil to found the Roman race.

Scarce out of sight of the Sicilian land
To seaward they were sailing cheerily,
Tilting the salt foam with each brazen beak,
When Juno, nursing in her bosom's depth
The undying wound, thus with her own soul spake:
“I to shrink foiled from my design, too weak
To ward the Teucrians' king from Italy,
Because the fates forbid! Could Pallas then
Burn up the Argive galleys, and their crews
Drown in the deep, for one man's mad offence,
Ajax, Oileus' son? With her own hand
She, hurling from the clouds Jove's nimble fire,
Scattered their barks, with winds upheaved the sea,
And him, his riven breast panting forth the flames,
Upwhirled and staked upon a pointed rock:
But I, who walk the queen of heaven, at once
Sister and spouse of Jove, with one weak race
These many years must war; and is there left
Still who to Juno's godhead bows the knee,
Or lays a suppliant's offering on her shrine?”

Such thoughts revolving in her fiery breast,
Lo! to the storm-clouds' home, Aeolia, tracts
Teeming with furious gales, the goddess came.
Here in a vast cave Aeolus, their king,
The wrestling winds and roaring hurricanes
Bends to his sway and curbs with prison-bonds;
They, with a mighty rumbling of the hill,
Growl chafing round their barriers; on the height,
Sceptre in hand, aloft sits Aeolus,
And sleeks their passions and allays their ire;
Else would they hale sea, land, and vaulted heaven
In their wild flight, and sweep them into space.
But with this fear the Sire omnipotent
Penned them in caverns dark, and o'er them piled
The bulk of lofty mountains, and a king
He gave them, who by settled bond should know
To grip the reins, or slacken, at his word.
Him Juno then with suppliant voice addressed:
“Aeolus, for to thee the Sire of gods
And King of men hath given to soothe the waves
Or lift them with his wind, a race to me
Hateful, now sailing o'er the Tuscan deep,
Bears Ilium and her conquered household gods
To Italy: strike wrath into the winds,
Sink and overwhelm their barks, or sunder far
And broadcast fling their bodies on the deep.
Twice seven fair nymphs of matchless mould have I,
Of whom Deiopea, fairest-formed,
In lasting wedlock will I knit with thee,
And dedicate her thine, that all her years
She for such service at thy side may spend,
And make thee father of a race as fair.”

Then answered Aeolus: “Thy task, O queen,
Is to search out thy pleasure, mine to do
Thy bidding: of thy grace is all I own
Of power, this sceptre, and consenting Jove;
Thou set'st me in the banquet-hall of heaven,
And mak'st me ruler of the clouds and storms.”

So having said, his spear he turned and thrust
Against the hollow mountain-side: the winds
As in compact array, where vent is given,
Rush forth and with tornado scour the world,
Swoop on the sea, and from its sunken bed
Upheave it whole in one wild onset, east,
South, and southwester with thick-coming squalls,
And roll huge billows to the shore. Anon
Rises the creak of cables, cry of men:
Clouds in a moment from the Trojans' eyes
Snatch heaven and day; black night broods o'er the deep:
Skies thunder; the air lightens, flash on flash;
No sign abroad but bodes them instant death.
Straight are Aeneas' limbs with shuddering loosed;
He groans, and, stretching his clasped hands to heaven,
Thus cries aloud: “O thrice and four times blest
Who won to die beneath Troy's lofty towers
Under their kinsmen's eyes! O Tydeus' son,
Bravest of Danaan blood! to think that I
On Ilium's plains was suffered not to fall,
Nor at thy hand let forth my life-breath, where
Fierce Hector by the son of Aeacus
Lay stricken low, where huge Sarpedon, where,
Caught down beneath his current, Simois rolls
Shields, helms, and bodies of the countless brave!”
Such words out-tossing, a loud blast from the north
Strikes him full-sail, and lifts the floods to heaven:
Crash go the oars, then swerves the prow and gives
The waves her broadside: on rolls, heaped and sheer,
A watery mountain: on the wave-tops some
Hang poised; to some the sea deep-yawning shows
Bare ground amid the billows, surge with sand
Raving; three ships the south wind's sudden clutch
Hurls upon hidden rocks—Italian folk
Name them the Altars rising 'mid the waves—
A vast ridge on the sea-top; three the east
Drives on to banks and shallows from the deep,
A piteous sight, and breaks them on the shoals,
And heaps the sand about them: one which bore
The Lycians and Orontes true of heart,
Even as he gazes, a huge sea astern
Strikes from above: dashed headlong from on board
Down goes the helmsman: her, spun whirling thrice
Even where she lies, the eddying gulf devours.
Here and there scattered on the weltering waste
Swimmers are seen, and heroes' arms, and planks,
And Trojan wealth upon the waters strewn.
Now the stout ship of Ilioneus, and now
Of brave Achates, that which bare on board
Abas, and that too of Aletes old,
The storm hath quelled; with rib-joints loosened, all
Let in the watery foe, and gaping split.

Meanwhile of ocean made one roaring mass,
And a storm launched, and all his water-floods
Wrung from their lowest deeps, was Neptune ware,
And sorely chafed he: o'er the deep he peered,
Above the billow lifting a calm brow:
Far scattered over all the main he sees
Aeneas' fleet, he sees the Trojans whelmed
Beneath the waters and the fallen sky,
Nor from her brother's heart were hid the wiles
And spite of Juno: to his side he bids
Eurus and Zephyr, and bespeaks them thus:
“Hold you such blind reliance on your birth?
So! dare ye now without my fiat, winds,
Mix earth and heaven, and mass these mountain-heights?
Whom I—but best the uproared floods appease:
Not all so lightly shall ye answer me
Your trespasses hereafter. Speed betimes!
And say ye to your king, not his, but mine
The empire and fell trident of the sea
By lot assigned. He sways the savage rocks,
Of thee, O Eurus, and thy tribe the home:
Let Aeolus hold court and vaunt him there,
And rule close-barred the prison of the winds.”

So saying, and swifter than that word, he smoothes
The swelling waters, routs the banded clouds,
Brings back the sun. Cymothoe therewithal
And Triton lend their shoulders to thrust off
From the sharp rock their vessels; he himself
Upheaves them with his trident, clears a way
Through the vast quicksands, and allays the flood,
And skims the wave-top lightly charioted.
And as when oft in some vast throng hath risen
A tumult, and the base herd waxeth mad,
And brands and stones, wrath-furnished weapons, fly,
Then, if some hero chance upon their sight,
Of weight for worth or exploit, they are hushed
And stand, all ear, to listen; with his words
He sways their passion, soothes their ruffled breasts;
So all at once the roar of ocean died,
What time, forth peering o'er the main, the Sire
Borne on a cloudless heaven his coursers drove,
And flying gave his willing chariot way.

Toil-worn the children of Aeneas strive
To make what shores are nearest, and at length
To Libya's coast they come. There is a spot
Deep in a cove's recess: an isle there makes
A harbour with the barrier of its sides,
'Gainst which no deep-sea billow but is dashed,
And sundered far into sequestered creeks.
On either side huge cliffs, a towering pair,
Frown up to heaven; sheer down in shelter sleep
Broad waters, while, a scene of waving woods,
Black shaggy groves hang beetling from above.
Under the cliff's face is a crag-hung cave;
Within, fresh springs and seats in the living rock
Nymph-haunted: the tired ships, to moor them here,
No cables need, nor hooked anchor's fang.
Here, mustering seven from all his tale of ships,
Aeneas enters; yearning sore for land,
Outleap the Trojans, gain the wished-for beach,
And lay their brine-drenched limbs upon the shore.
Achates from a flint first struck the spark,
And nursed the fire in leaves, and, heaping round
Dry fuel, on tinder quickly caught the flame.
Then, weary of fate, their sea-marred corn they fetch,
And gear of the corn-goddess, and prepare
The rescued grain to parch, and pound with stone.

Meanwhile Aeneas scales a crag, to scan
In one wide survey all the sea, if aught
Of Antheus and the Phrygian biremes there
Wind-drifted he may spy, or Capys, or
Caicus' arms upon the lofty stern.
Vessel in sight is none, on shore he sees
Three stags before him ranging; in their rear
The whole herd follow, and in long array
Wind feeding through the valleys. Then he stopped,
Seized in his clutch a bow and winged shafts—
Weapons which true Achates chanced to bear—
And first themselves the leaders, holding high
Their heads with branchy antlers, he lays low,
And then the herd, and all the rout pell-mell
Plies with his arrows through the leafy brakes,
Nor stays his hand till seven huge frames on earth
He casts in triumph, to match the tale of ships.
Thence to the port he hies, gives all their share,
And next the wine, which on Trinacria's shore
In casks Acestes had in bounty stowed—
A hero's gift at parting—he metes out,
And with this utterance soothes their troubled breasts:
“O comrades, for not all unlearned of ills
Are we already—O schooled to worser woes
Than these, of these too heaven will grant an end.
Even Scylla's fury and deep-bellowing rocks
Have ye drawn nigh, and proved the Cyclop-crags:
Courage recall; dull fears forgo: belike
This too with joy will be remembered yet.
Through shifting perils, by many a brink of death,
Toward Latium are we faring, where the fates
Portend us quiet resting-places: there
The realm of Troy must from her ashes rise:
Endure, and hoard yourselves for happier days.”

So spake his lips, while, sick with extreme woe,
Hope's mask he wears, and chokes the anguish down.
They to the spoil, the feast that is to be,
Address them, flay the ribs, the flesh lay bare;
Part cleave it into pieces, and on spits
Still quivering-fresh impale them; other some
Set cauldrons on the shore, and tend the fires.
Then with the food they summon back their strength,
And stretched upon the greensward take their fill
Of old wine and fat venison. When good cheer
Had banished hunger, and the board was cleared,
In endless talk for their lost mates they yearn,
'Twixt hope and fear uncertain whether still
Among the quick to deem them, or even now
Suffering the worst, and deaf to their last cry.
And chiefly good Aeneas, now the fate
Of keen Orontes, now of Amycus,
And inly, Lycus, thine untimely doom,
And for brave Gyas, brave Cloanthus, mourns.

And now they had ended, when from heights of air
Down-glancing on the sail-flown sea, and lands
With shores and widespread peoples stretched below,
Jupiter thus upon the cope of heaven
Made pause, and fixed his eyes on Libya's realm.
Him then, such cares revolving in his breast,
Sadder than wont, her bright eyes brimmed with tears,
Venus bespake: “O thou who swayest the tides
Of men and gods with sovereign power eterne,
And scar'st them with thy bolt, what crime so dire
Can my Aeneas, what the sons of Troy
Have wrought to-thee-ward, that against them now,
By death so minished, the whole world stands barred,
And all for Italy? Surely that from these
Should one day issue with revolving years
The Romans, ay, from these the warrior-chiefs
Of Teucer's blood requickened, born to rule
All-potent sea and land, thou promisedst:
What purpose, Sire, has warped thee? I indeed
Hereby, with counter-fate requiting fate,
Oft solaced me for Troy's sad overthrow;
But the same fortune, that pursued so long,
Still dogs them with disaster. Mighty king,
What end dost thou vouchsafe them of their toils?
Antenor, from the Achaean midst escaped,
Could thrid Illyria's windings all unscathed,
Far inward to Liburnian realms, and pass
The well-springs of Timavus, whence the sea
Bursts through nine mouths 'mid thunder of the rocks,
And whelms his fields beneath the roaring main.
Yet here Patavium's city founded he,
To be his Teucrians' dwelling-place, and named
The nation, and hung high the arms of Troy;
Now rests he tranquil, lulled in calm repose:
But we, thine offspring, whom thy nod assigns
The height of heaven, our ships—O misery!—lost,
To slake one wrathful spirit are forsook,
And sundered far from the Italian coast.
Is this the good man's guerdon? Dost thou so
Restore us to our empire?”

Upon her
Smiling with that regard, wherewith he clears
Tempestuous skies, the Sire of men and gods
His daughter's lips touched, and bespake her thus:
“Truce, Cytherea, to thy fears, and know
Unshaken stand thy children's destinies:
Lavinium's city and predestined walls
Thou shalt behold, and in thine arms up-bear
High-souled Aeneas to the stars of heaven:
Nor hath my purpose warped me. This thy son—
For I, to ease thy gnawing care, will speak,
From fate's dark roll her inmost secrets wring—
Shall wage a mighty war in Italy,
Crush the proud folk, and for his warriors found
A city and a system, till the third
Summer hath seen him lord in Latium,
Three winters o'er the vanquished Rutules sped.
But young Ascanius, newly now surnamed
Iulus—His was he while enthroned
Stood Ilium's State—shall compass in his reign
Thirty great cycles with revolving months,
And from Lavinium shift his empire's seat,
And Alba Longa's ramparts rear with power:
Here now shall reign full thrice a hundred years
Great Hector's line, till Ilia, royal maid
And priestess, shall twin offspring bear to Mars,
Their sire; then glorying in the tawny hide
Of the she-wolf, his nurse, shall Romulus
Take up the nation, build the war-god's town,
And call them Romans after his own name.
For these nor goals of power, nor times I fix—
Grant them a boundless sway. Fierce Juno too,
Who now with terror scares earth, sea, and heaven,
Shall turn to kinder counsels, and with me
Cherish the Romans, masters of the world,
The toga'd nation. So hath heaven decreed.
A time shall come with gliding lustres, when
The house of Assaracus to her yoke shall bow
Phthia and famed Mycenae, and bear sway
O'er conquered Argos. From that glorious line
Of Troy descending, Caesar shall be born,
Destined to bound with ocean his domain,
As with the stars his glory, Julius,
A name bequeathed from great Iulus. Him,
Laden with eastern spoils, shalt thou one day
Hold safe in heaven: to him too prayers shall rise.
Then wars shall cease, the rugged times grow mild;
Hoar Faith, and Vesta, and Quirinus then
Yoked with his brother Remus, shall give laws;
Grim-knit with bolts of iron, War's temple-gates
Shut fast shall be, while hellish Rage within
High on a grisly pile of arms, his hands
Brass-bound behind him with a hundred knots,
Shall roar terrific from blood-boltered mouth.”

So saying, he sends down Maia's son from heaven,
That Carthage her new towers and lands might ope
To greet the Teucrians, lest, unlearned of fate,
Dido repel them. Through the vast of air
His plumed oars he plies, on Libya's strand
Has swift alighted; ay, even now he is
About his errand; the god wills, and lo!
Those haughty hearts the Punic folk put by;
Their queen in chief toward the Teucrian host
Now harbours gentle thoughts and kind desires.

But good Aeneas, all night long perplexed
With many a care, when first the genial boon
Of light was given, resolved to issue forth,
Search out the new land, and what shores he hath gained
By the wind's grace, whether by man or beast—
So savage seem they—tenanted, then bear
Back to his friends the tidings of his quest.
In woody creek beneath a hollow rock
His fleet he hides, by trees and bristling shades
Closely embosomed, then himself strides forth,
Achates sole beside him, in his hand
Two javelins brandishing broad-tipped with iron.

Him, half the wood-way through, his mother met,
In face and garb a maiden, armed with gear
Of Spartan damsel, or like her of Thrace,
Harpalyce, what time she tires her steeds,
Outspeeding arrowy Hebrus in her flight.
For from her shoulders huntress-wise was slung
A shapely bow; her tresses she let trail
Upon the winds, bare-kneed, her flowing folds
Close gathered in a knot. Ere he could speak,
“Ho!” cried she, “youths, if ye have chanced to spy
One of my sisters, tell me where she strays,
With quiver and spotted lynx-skin girt, or else
Hard on the track of foaming boar, full cry.”

So Venus, and in answer Venus' son:
“None of thy sisters have I seen or heard,
O—damsel must I name thee? for thy face
Nor mortal seems, nor human rings thy voice:
O goddess surely, or Phoebus' sister thou,
Or of the blood of nymphs, whoe'er thou art,
Be kind, uplift the burden of our woe,
And deign to say what heaven bends over us,
Cast on what borders of the world: for here
Witless of country or of folk we roam,
By winds and mighty billows hither driven.
So on thine altars at our hand shall fall
Full many a victim.”

Then spake Venus: “Nay,
Not mine to claim such worship; Tyrian maids
Wont thus to wear the quiver, and bind their limbs
High with the purple buskin. Here thou seest
The Punic realm, a Tyrian people, this
Agenor's city, but all the borderland
Libyan, a race untamable in war.
Dido, whom erst from Tyre a brother's fear
Banished, now reigns their empress; 'tis a long
And tangled tale of outrage, but the main
Threads I will trace. Sychaeus was her spouse,
In all Phoenicia lord of widest lands:
Fondly, poor heart, she loved him, by her sire
A virgin given, and in first bridal yoked.
But reigned o'er Tyre a monster-king of crime,
Pygmalion, her brother, and there came
Fury between them. At the household shrine,
Impious and blinded by the lust of gold,
With stealthy stroke at unawares he slays
Sychaeus, all reckless of his sister's love.
Long he concealed the deed, by many a base
Dissimulation with illusive hope
Fooling the love-sick bride. But in her sleep
Uprose the form of her unburied lord,
That, lifting a face pale in wondrous wise,
Laid bare the ruthless altar, and therewith
His steel-pierc'd bosom, and unveiled to view
All the dark horror of the household crime.
Then from her home at swiftest speed to hie
He bids her, and for aid upon the way
Old treasures hid within the earth reveals,
Store known to none of silver and of gold.
Scared at the tale, Dido her flight prepares
And friends to fly with: round her throng whom fierce
Hate for the tyrant, or keen terror, filled;
Chance-proffered ships they seize, and lade with gold:
Pygmalion's treasures from his gripe are borne
O'er seas, a woman piloting the way.
So to the place they came, where now thou spyest
The lofty walls and rising citadel
Of new-built Carthage, and of land they bought—
Called Byrsa from their bargaining—so much
As with a bull's hide they might compass round.
But who are ye, sirs, from what shores arrived,
Or on what journey bound?” So questioned, he
With accents from his deepest heart-springs drawn,
Sighing, replied:

“Goddess, should I recount
From their first source, and wert thou free to hear,
Our sorrow's sad recital, eve would first
Put day to sleep, and shut the gates of heaven.
From ancient Troy, if haply through thine ears
Troy's name has entered, borne o'er many a main,
The wind's whim drave us to the Libyan shores.
Men call me good Aeneas; in this fleet
Snatched from the foe my household gods I bring,
In fame extolled above the stars. My goal
Is Italy, my country, and a race
Sprung from high Jove. With twice ten ships I climbed
The Phrygian main, by fate's clear promise led,
My goddess-mother pointing me the way;
Scarce seven remain, by winds and waters riven.
Myself the while, a beggar and unknown,
Range here the Libyan waste, an outcast banned
From Europe and from Asia.” His sad plaint
Venus could bear no longer, but broke in
Thus on his grief's mid utterance:

“Whosoe'er
Thou art, not all unloved, methinks, of heaven
Draw'st thou the breath of life, who thus hast reached
Our Tyrian city: but go forward still,
And hence to the queen's palace win thy way;
For news I bring thee of thy friends' return,
Thy fleet in harbour, by the shifting gales
To shelter driven; or idly and for naught
My parents schooled me in prophetic lore.
See yonder swans twice six in jubilant line,
Which from the skiey region with his swoop
Jove's bird was routing o'er the plains of heaven:
Now in long train they seem some lighting-ground
To choose, or, chosen, scan it from above:
As these, returned, with hurtling pinions play,
Wheel in one flock through heaven, and utter songs,
So, of thy ships and friends aboard them, some
Are safe in port, and some with swelling sails
Now make the harbour: only do thou still
Go forward, follow where the pathway leads.”

She spake, and turning shone with rosy neck;
Her head's ambrosial locks breathed scent divine;
And, as her robe flowed downward to her feet,
She stepped no doubtful goddess. When he knew
His mother, her fleeting form he thus pursued,
Crying, “Ah! cruel thou too, wherefore mock
Thy son so oft with semblances untrue?
Why may I never clasp thy hand in mine,
Or hear unfeigned accents and reply?”

So chiding, toward the town he wends his way.
But Venus with a dark haze hedged them in,
As on they strode, and a thick mantling mist
Miraculous shed over them, that none
Might see, or touch, or compass their delay,
Or ask their cause of coming. She herself
Aloft to Paphos hies, her loved abode
Blithe to revisit, where her temple stands,
And with Sabaean incense ever smoke
A hundred altars, fragrant with fresh flowers.

Meanwhile, where points the track, they speed their way,
And now the hill they climb, that o'er the town
Hangs huge, and frowns above the opposing towers.
Aeneas marvels at the mighty mass,
Mere huts of yore, he marvels at the gates,
The busy din and paving of the ways.
The Tyrians in hot haste are building walls,
Rearing a citadel, and uprolling rocks
By toil of hand; some choose a dwelling-site,
And with a trench surround it: they appoint
An awful senate, laws, and magistrates.
Here these are digging harbours, yonder those
Lay deep foundations for a theatre,
And hew gigantic columns from the rocks,
Lofty adornments of a stage to be.
Such toil in early summer as keeps the bees
Busy in sunshine amid flowery fields,
When forth they lead the ripe youth of their race,
Or pack the amber-dripping honey, and stretch
Their cells to bursting with the nectar sweet,
Or ease returning labourers of their load,
Or form a band, and from their precincts drive
The drones, a lazy herd: how glows the work!
How sweet the honey smells of perfumed thyme!

“O happy ye, whose walls already rise,”
Exclaims Aeneas, toward the city-roofs
Upgazing, and so enters through their midst,
Hedged in with darkness, marvellous to tell,
And mingles with the folk, unseen of all.

Within the city's midst a grove there stood
Bounteous of shade, where first the Punic host,
'Scaped from the brunt of whirlwind and of wave,
Dug forth, as queenly Juno had foreshown,
The symbol of a fiery horse's head:
For so, said she, their race should ever prove
Peerless in war and with abundance blest.
Sidonian Dido here a mighty fane
To Juno's praise was rearing, rich with gifts
And with the indwelling goddess: see! of brass
High on ascending steps the threshold lay,
And clenched with brass the lintels, of brass too
The doors on creaking hinges. In this grove
A strange sight met him, that first soothed his fear;
Here first Aeneas dared for safety hope,
And in his broken fortunes firmlier trust.
For 'neath the mighty fane while he surveys
Point after point, still waiting for the queen,
And marvels to behold what fortune crowns
The city, and her craftsmen's emulous hands
And toil of labour, there set forth he sees
The battlefields of Ilium, and the war
By fame now bruited over the whole world,
Priam and Atreus' sons, and, bane of both,
Achilles. With arrested steps he cries
Weeping, “What place, Achates, or what clime
But with the story of our grief o'erflows?
See Priam! even here, too, honour hath its meed,
And there are tears for what befalls, and hearts
Touched by the chances of mortality.
Fear naught, and thou shalt find this fame will bring
Some safety with it.”

He spake, and feasts his soul
Upon the empty picture, sighing sore,
His face all bathed with grief's abundant flow.
For, as they fought round Pergamus, behold!

# The Aeneid I

Here fled the Greeks, Troy's bravest at their heels,
The Phrygians here, Achilles in his car
With crested helm pursuing. Nor far aloof
With tears he knew the snowy-canvassed tents
Of Rhesus, which, in the first sleep betrayed,
Red Tydeus' son was deluging with blood,
Who campward now drives off the fiery steeds,
Or ere on Trojan pastures they have browsed,
Or drunk of Xanthus. Elsewhere was portrayed,
His arms in flight flung from him, Troilus:
Poor boy! for with Achilles overmatched,
Dragged by his steeds to the void car he clings,
Thrown backward, and yet grasping still the reins:
Neck, see! and hair are trailed along the ground,
And his reversed spear scribbles in the dust.

Meanwhile the Trojan women to the shrine
Of unregardful Pallas passed along
Bearing the peplus, all their tresses loosed,
As suppliant mourners with hand-bruised breasts;
On earth the goddess with averted gaze
Her eyes were fixing. There Achilles too
Had thrice dragged Hector round the walls of Troy,
And now was bartering his dead corse for gold.
Then from the bottom of his heart he heaved
A mighty groan, when he beheld the spoils,
The chariot, nay, the body of his friend,
And Priam outstretching his defenceless hands.

Himself too there among the Achaean chiefs
He recognized, and dusky Memnon's arms
And eastern warriors. With their mooned shields
Penthesilea like a fury leads
The Amazonian ranks, and blazes forth
Amid her thousands, one protruding breast
Looped with a golden girdle—warrior-queen,
Who dares the shock of battle, maid with men.

Now while Aeneas the Dardan at this sight
Marvels, beholding, while amazed he stands
In one fixed gaze immovable, the queen,
Dido, in matchless beauty, to the fane,
Thronged with a mighty company, has come.
As by Eurotas' banks, or on the heights
Of Cynthus, when Diana plies the dance—
A thousand Oreads upon either side
Massed in her train—she on her shoulder bears
A quiver, and as she treads o'ertops them all—
A secret rapture thrills Latona's breast—
Such Dido seemed, so moved she through their midst
Rejoicing, busied with her realm to be.

Then in the sacred portals and beneath
The mid vault of the temple, hedged with arms,
Propped high upon a throne, her seat she took.
There laws and judgements gave she to her folk,
Now meting forth their tasks in equal shares,
Now doling them by lot: when suddenly
'Mid a great throng Aeneas sees approach
Antheus, Sergestus, and Cloanthus brave,
And other Teucrians whom the black typhoon
Had scattered o'er the main, or swept afar
To alien shores. Achates and his chief,
Thrilled and bewildered betwixt joy and fear,
Yearn eagerly to clasp their hands, but still,
By the strange fact confounded, make no sign,
And from their cloudy covering watch to learn
The heroes' fortunes, on what shore their fleet
They are leaving, with what hope arrived, for lo!
From all the ships came envoys craving grace,
And with loud clamour making for the shrine.

So when they had entered and gat leave to speak,
Their eldest, Ilioneus, thus took the word
With heart unruffled: "O queen, whom Jove assigns
To found a virgin city, and curb in
Unbending nations with the reins of law,
We Trojans, tempest-driven from sea to sea,
In bitter case implore thee, from our ships
Ward off the unutterable doom of fire:
Spare us, a pious race, and on our plight
Look with no distant eyes. We have not come
To harry with the sword your Libyan homes,
Or seize the spoil, and drive it to the shore:
Such lawlessness we like not, nor so prone
Are conquered men to insolence. There is
A spot, by Greeks Hesperia named, a land
Of old renown, mighty in arms, in soil
Prolific, where the Oenotrian heroes dwelt,
Now by a later race named Italy,
If rumour lie not, from their leader's name.
Thither our course we held, when, big with storm,
Orion, rising with a sudden sea,
Drave us on hidden shoals, and scattered us
Far athwart billows of o'ertoppling brine
And pathless rocks, before the headstrong south:
Hither we few have floated to your shores.

What race of men is this? What land allows
Custom so cruel? The welcome of the shore
Denied, they dare us at sword's point set foot
Upon the utmost margin of their land.
If men and mortal arms ye hold so light,
Yet look for gods mindful of right and wrong.
Aeneas was our king, none juster, none
More famed for goodness, or for feats of war.
If fate still spare that hero, if he still
Feeds on the air of heaven, nor yet is laid
In cruel darkness, naught have we to fear;
No, nor wouldst thou repent thee to have been
His challenger in kindness. Cities too
And arms to aid in Sicily have we,
And famed Acestes, sprung from Trojan blood.
Let us but haul our battered fleet ashore,
Fit planks in the forest, and trim oars, that if
Vouchsafed us still to make for Italy,
Comrades and king restored, with hearts elate
To Italy and Latium we may go;
But if cut off our safety, and if thee,
Best father of the Teucrians, Libya's deep
Holds in its keeping, and no hope is now
Left in Iulus, we at least may seek
Sicania's strait from whence we sailed, the homes
There waiting, and Acestes for our king."

So Ilioneus; and instant with one mouth
Clamoured assent the sons of Dardanus.
Then briefly Dido speaks with drooping eyes:
"Cast fear adrift, ye Teucrians, shut the doors
On doubt: the hard conditions of the time
And raw youth of my kingdom to this push
Compel me, and to guard my frontiers round.
The comrades of Aeneas, and Troy's town,
Her heroes and their heroisms, and all
Her war's vast conflagration, who is there
That knows not? Not so dull indeed the hearts
We bear in Punic bosoms, nor so far
Out of the sun's track in his charioting
Our Tyrian town. The great Hesperian land
And Saturn's realm, or Eryx and the tract
That bows to king Acestes—choose ye which;
Safeguarded I will speed you on your way,
With stores to boot. Or would ye in this realm
Sit down beside me? Yours the town I build:
Haul up your ships: Trojan and Tyrian
Without distinction shall be held by me.
And would that by the selfsame tempest driven
Your king himself Aeneas had been here!
For my part, I will send through all my coasts
Sure scouts, and bid them traverse Libya's land
From end to end, if haply cast ashore
Forest or city holds him wandering."

Fired by these words long since Achates bold
And Prince Aeneas burned to break their cloud.
Achates first gat utterance: "Goddess-born,
Say now what purpose rises in thy heart?
Thou seest all safe, comrades and fleet restored,
One only lacking, whom our own eyes saw
Gulfed in mid-ocean: with thy mother's words
Else all things tally." Scarcely had he spoken,
When suddenly the cloud that wrapped them round
Sunders, and melts into the open heaven.
Forth stood Aeneas in the clear sunlight
Resplendent, face and shoulders like a god:
For she who bare him on her son had breathed
A glory of hair, and ruddy light of youth,
And on his eyes glad lustre—such a grace
As artist's hand to ivory lends, or like
Silver or Parian chased with yellow gold.
Then to the queen, by all unlooked for, thus
Sudden he speaks: "I, whom ye seek, am here,
Trojan Aeneas, snatched from Libyan waves.
Thou, who alone the unutterable woes
Of Troy hast pitied, and dost impart to us—
Sole remnant by the Danai left, fordone
With all mischances both of land and sea,
Beggared of all—a city and a home,
Dido, to yield thee worthy thanks stands not
Within our means, nor theirs who else survive
Of Dardan blood, scattered the wide world o'er.
May heaven, if any powers regard the good,
If justice and the self-approving mind
Weigh aught in the world, return thee guerdon due!
What age so blest as to have borne thee? What
Parents so noble as to call thee child?
While rivers still shall run into the sea,
While shadows sweep the mountain-sides, while heaven
Shall feed the stars, thy glory, name, and praise,
What land soe'er me summon, shall remain."

So saying, his right hand he reached forth to greet
Friend Ilioneus, Serestus with his left,
Then others, bold Gyas and Cloanthus bold.
Astounded by the hero's presence first,
Then at his vast misfortune, thus outspake
Sidonian Dido: "Through such mighty perils,
O goddess-born, what fate pursues, what force
To barbarous shores impels thee? Art thou that
Aeneas, whom kindly Venus by the wave
Of Phrygian Simois to the Dardan bare,
Anchises? I myself remember well
When Teucer, from his own home ousted, came
To Sidon, seeking a new realm to win
By Belus' aid: my father Belus then
Was harrying Cyprus, whose rich soil he swayed
With conquering sceptre. From that time to this
Troy's chequered fortune hath been known to me,
And thine own name, and the Pelasgian kings.
Even he, their foeman, with high praise would laud
The Teucrians, from the Teucrian's ancient stock
Claim to be sprung. Then enter, sirs, our house.
Me also, tossed from toil to toil, like chance
Suffers at length to make this land my home:
Nor all unlessoned in calamity
Learn I to aid the wretched." With such words
She to her palace leads Aeneas in,
And for the temples of the gods proclaims
Due honour. For his comrades therewithal
Down to the beach she sends a score of bulls,
A hundred bristling backs of burly swine,
Fat lambs a hundred, with their dams to boot,
Glad gifts for the glad day. Meanwhile, within,
The palace is set forth in all the pomp
Of royal splendour, and amidst the hall
A feast are they preparing—coverlets
Wrought deftly of proud purple, on the boards
Ponderous silver, and, embossed in gold,
The brave deeds of her sires, an endless-long
Array of exploits traced from chief to chief
Down from the earliest dawning of her race.

Aeneas, for a father's love forbade
His mind to rest, sends forward to the ships
Achates, bidding him with speed acquaint
Ascanius, and conduct him to the town—
Upon Ascanius a fond father's heart
Is wholly set—and presents he bids bring
Snatched from the wreck of Ilium, a long robe
Stiff with embroidered gold-work, and a veil
Purfled with yellow-flowered acanthus, worn
By Argive Helen, and from Mycenae brought,
What time to Troy she sailed, a bride forbid—
Her mother Leda's marvellous gift; therewith
A sceptre which erewhile had known the grasp
Of Priam's eldest daughter Ilione,
A pearl-strung necklet, and a double crown
Of gems and gold. Upon this errand sped,
Achates now was hastening to the ships.

But Cytherea in her breast revolves
New wiles and new devices, that, for sweet
Ascanius, Cupid, changed in face and form,
May come, and with his gifts inflame the queen
To frenzy, and wrap all her frame in fire.
Ay, for in sooth she fears the treacherous house
And double-spoken Tyrians: Juno's hate
Sears her, and trouble at nightfall returns.
Thus, therefore, she bespeaks her winged Love:
"Son, my sole strength and mighty power, O son,
Who laughest even at the Typhoean bolts
Of the great Father, to thy feet I fly,
And suppliant sue thy godhead. How Aeneas,
Thy brother, is buffeted from shore to shore
Over the main by Juno's rancorous spite—
These things are known to thee, and with our grief
Oft hast thou grieved. Phoenician Dido now
Holds and enchains him with her flattering words;
And much I fear where Juno's welcome tends;
She will not idle where such hopes are hinged.
So to prevent the queen with guile, and gird
With fire I purpose, that no power may change,
But strong love for Aeneas fix her mind.
Next how to achieve it hearken my device:
The royal boy, my chiefest care, e'en now
To the Sidonian town sets forth to go
At his loved father's bidding—in his hand
Gifts that escaped Troy's burning and the sea.
Him will I hide upon Cythera's height,
Or on Idalium in my sacred seat,
Lulled in deep slumber, that my stratagems
He may not know nor intervene to mar.
Then for one night—no more—feign thou his form,
And don the well-known features, boy for boy,
That when with rapture at the royal board,
The wine-god brimming, Dido to her breast
Shall take thee and embrace, and on thy lips
Imprint sweet kisses, with the subtle fire
Thy breath may poison her at unawares."

Obedient then to his dear mother's words,
Love doffed his wings, and with Iulus' step
Walked gaily forth. Meantime Ascanius,
While gentle slumber o'er his frame she pours,
Venus, to her immortal bosom clasped,
Bears upward to Idalia's wooded heights,
Where soft amaracus enfolds with flowers,
And fans him with the breath of odorous shade.
And now, all joy, Achates for his guide,
Cupid the royal gifts obediently
Came bearing for the Tyrians. Entering,
He sees the queen set in their midst, reclined
Upon a gold couch proudly canopied.
Now Prince Aeneas, now the Trojan men
Gather, and stretch them on strewn purple. Slaves
Pour water on their hands, and proffer bread
From baskets, and bring towels with shorn pile.
Within are fifty handmaids, charged in course
To heap continuous store, and magnify
With fire the hearth-gods; and a hundred more,
With men as many and of like age, to load
The boards with viands, and set the winecups on.
The Tyrians also, through the festive hall
Gathered in crowds, are bidden to recline
On broidered couches. At Aeneas' gifts
They marvel, marvel at Iulus too—
The god-light in his face, the well-feigned words—
And at the robe, and veil embroidered-fair
With yellow-flowered acanthus. Most of all,
Ill-starred, and destined to the coming bane,
The fair Phoenician cannot gloat her fill,
But feeds the flame with gazing, by the boy
Ravished no less than by the gifts. But he,
When he had clasped Aeneas, and hung close
About his neck, sating the hungry love
Of his pretended sire, moves toward the queen.
She with her eyes, and she with all her heart
Cleaves to him, and fondles at her breast anon—
Dido, all witless of how great a god
Is her poor bosom's burden. He the while,
His Acidalian mother heeding well,
Slowly begins to blot Sychaeus out,
And with a living passion to forestall
A heart long stagnant and to love unused.

When the first hush upon the banquet fell,
The board removed, they set on mighty bowls,
And crown the winecups. Loud the rafters ring,
As through the wide hall rolls the roar of tongues;
Down from the gilded roof hang lamps ablaze,
And flambeaux flaring put the night to rout.
And now a cup heavy with gems and gold
The queen bade bring, and filled it with pure wine,
As Belus used, and all from Belus sprung;
Then through the hall fell silence: "Jupiter,
Of hospitable laws, men say, the giver,
To Tyrians and to travellers from Troy
Grant that this day propitious be, and that
Our children's children may remember it.
Let Bacchus, source of merriment, be near,
And bounteous Juno; and, ye Tyrians too,
Grace ye our gathering with goodwill." She spake
And on the table poured the votive wine,
And, having made libation, with lip's edge
Herself first touched it, then to Bitias
Passed with a merry taunt; he, nothing loth,
Drank of the foaming goblet, and dived deep
Into the brimming gold; then other lords
In turn. Iopas of the flowing hair
Makes the hall echo with his gilded lyre,
Once taught of mightiest Atlas: and his song
Is of the wandering moon, the toiling sun,
Whence human kind and cattle, whence rain and fire;
Arcturus, and the showery Hyades,
And the twin Bears; why winter suns so haste
To dip themselves in Ocean, or what check
Retards the lingering nights. With shout on shout
Applaud the Tyrians, and the sons of Troy
Make answer: therewithal in varied talk
Unhappy Dido still spun out the night,
Drinking deep draughts of love; and much she asked
Of Priam, much of Hector, with what arms
Aurora's son came girded to the fray,
How fair the steeds of Diomede, or how vast
Achilles. "Nay, but, O my guest," said she,
"Come, tell us from the first the Danaan plots,
Thy comrades' woes, and thine own wanderings:
For lo! the seventh returning summer now
Bears thee a wanderer over land and wave."

## Book II

All lips were hushed, all eyes attentive fixed:
Then Prince Aeneas from his lofty couch
Addressed him thus to speak:

"Unutterable,
O queen, the grief thou bid'st me to revive,
How Troy's magnificence and royal power,
Woe worth the day! the Danai overthrew;
Thrice piteous scenes which I myself beheld,
And was a mighty part of! Such a tale
Who or of Myrmidons or Dolopes
Or stern Ulysses' soldiery could tell,
And hold from weeping? Now, too, dewy night
Adown the sky falls headlong, and the stars
Sinking invite to sleep. But if to learn
Our woes such longing take thee, and to hear
Brief-told Troy's dying anguish, though my mind
At the remembrance shudders, from the grief
Recoils, I will attempt it.

"Broken in war,
And baffled by the fates, the Danaan chiefs,
Now that so many grew the gliding years,
By Pallas' aid, artificer divine,
Build up a horse of mountain bulk, the ribs
Of pine-planks interwoven, feigning it
A votive offering for their home-return;
So runs the rumour. Into its dark side
Picked warriors stealthily by lot they stow,
And fill the deep vaults of its mighty womb
With armed soldiery.

"There lies in sight
An isle, fame-bruited, Tenedos, full-fraught
Of power, while yet stood Priam's empire—now
Mere bay and roadstead, ill for keels to trust.
Hither they sail, and on the barren shore
Lie hid. We deem them far upon their way,
Bound for Mycenae with a favouring gale.
Thereat all Teucria shuffles off the load
Of her long mourning. Wide are flung the gates;
Whence issuing forth with rapture we behold
The Dorian camp, the haunts now tenantless,
The shore left void: here the Dolopian band,
Here fierce Achilles pitched; here lay the fleet;
Here were they wont to meet us, host to host.
Some gape at Maid Minerva's doom-fraught gift,
And marvel at the monster-horse; and first
Thymoetes urged it within walls be haled,
And lodged in the fortress, or through treachery, or
That thither now the fates of Troy were set.

But Capys and the minds of saner bent
Bid either hurl it headlong in the sea—
This Danaan ambush, their suspicious gift—
Or fire it from beneath, or pierce and probe
The womb's dark hollows. With fierce party-cries
This way and that the wavering crowd is torn.

"First of a mighty throng, outspeeding all,
Laocoon from the citadel's steep height
Comes running in hot haste, and cries from far,
'Alack! so mad, my masters! do ye think
The foe departed? deem ye any gift
Of Danaans can lack guile? Have ye so learned
Ulysses? or within this timber caged
Achaeans lurk, or 'tis an engine framed
Against the walls, to spy into our homes
And pounce upon the city from above,
Or else some trickery lurks therein; trust not
The horse, ye Trojans; whatsoe'er it be,
Even gift in hand, I fear the Danai still.'

So saying, with main strength a huge spear he hurled
At the brute's flank, and where the framework bulged
To belly: it stood there quivering; the womb shook;
The vaults rang hollow and gave forth a groan:
And had the powers above, had our own wit
Not turned awry, he had prevailed to sack
The Argives' den; Troy still were standing; thou,
Priam's tall citadel, unshaken still.

"Meanwhile a youth, his hands behind him bound,
See! Dardan hinds come haling to the king,
Loud-clamouring, who, to shape it even so,
And let the Achaeans into Troy, had thrust
A stranger's wilful presence on their path,
Dauntless of soul, and armed for this or that—
His wiles to ply, or fall on certain death.
Eager to see, Troy's sons from every side
Rush round him like a torrent, each with each
Vying to mock their captive. Come now, hear
How Danaans can deceive, and learn from one
The villainy of all. For as he stood
Helpless, confused, a target for all eyes,
And gazed around upon the Phrygian ranks,
'Alas!' he cried, 'what land, what ocean now
Can harbour me? or what last hope have I—
The wretch, alike from Danaan earth debarred,
And for whose blood the Dardans howl no less,
To quit their hatred?' By that burst of grief
Changed was our humour, checked each rude assault;
We urge him speak, relate from whence he sprang,
His errand what, and why, a thrall, so bold.
Then, fear abandoned, thus at length he speaks:
'All will I truly tell thee, King,' quoth he,
'Betide what may; my Argive birth I own:
This at the outset; nor, if Fortune shaped
Sinon for misery, shall her spite, beside,
Shape him to fraud and falsehood. It may be,
Borne on men's voices, to thine ear hath sped
Some sound of Palamede from Belus sprung,
A name world-famous, whom by lies betrayed,
Guiltless, and on a villain's charge, because
The war he gainsaid, the Pelasgian lords
Once did to death, now, lorn of light, deplore.
To him as comrade and near kinsman I
Was by a needy sire in earliest youth
Sent hither to the field. While yet enthroned
Scathless he stood, and at kings' councils throve,
I in some sort held rank and honour too:
But when Ulysses' treacherous spite, I speak
No secret, drave him from the realms of day,
Downcast and darkling my sad life dragged on,
With inward wrath for my friend's guiltless fate.
Nor—madman—could I hold my peace, but vowed,
Should chance but offer, to my Argive home
If e'er returned in triumph, to wreak his fall,
And, thus outspoken, stirred the goads of hate.
Thence my first slip to ruin, Ulysses thence
Ceased not to scare me with new charges, thence
To sow dark rumours in the common ear,
And hunt for armed accomplices. Indeed
No rest he took till, Calchas at his side—
But why the unwelcome record do I thus
Vainly unroll? Or why the tale prolong?
If all the Achaeans in one class ye file,
And hearing that suffices, take, 'tis time,
Your vengeance; this the Ithacan would wish,
And this the Atridae grudge no gold to buy.'

"Then truly burn we to search out and learn
The why and wherefore, strangers as we were
To guilt so monstrous and Pelasgian guile.
He, quaking, with false heart his speech renews:
'Oft were the Danai fain to take their flight,
Leave Troy behind, and quit the weary war;
And would they had done so! the rough sea as oft
Opposed its stormy barrier, and the south
Scared them from going. Chiefly when yon horse,
Of maple-beams compacted, stood erect,
With bellowing storm-clouds the whole welkin rang.
Doubtful, we send Eurypylus to ask
The oracle of Phoebus: from the shrine
This dolorous word he brings. "It was with blood
Of a slain virgin ye appeased the winds,
When, Danai, first ye made for Ilium's shore:
With blood no less must your return be sought,
And expiation of an Argive's life."

" 'When to the people's ears this utterance came,
Numbed were all hearts, and through their inmost bones
Ran a chill shudder—who was he by fate
Predestined thus? Apollo's victim who?
Then he of Ithaca with blusterings loud
Drags forth into their midst Calchas the seer;
Hotly demands, what is this will of heaven.
Nor lacked there who even then foretold to me
The schemer's cruel outrage, or who saw
The end, yet spake not. Twice five days the seer
In silence hides him, vows no word of his
Shall denounce any, or to death consign.
Scarce driven at length by the Ithacan's loud cries,
To crown their compact, he breaks forth in speech,
And dooms me to the altar. All approved,
And turned what each was fearing for himself
To one poor soul's destruction. Now drew near
The unutterable day; for me were now
The altar-rites preparing, the salt cakes
And brow-encircling fillets. I confess
I plucked me from perdition, brake my bonds,
In miry pool all night sedge-sheltered lay,
Till they should sail, if haply sailed they had.
Nor longer my old country may I hope,
Or children sweet, or longed-for sire, to see,
Of whom far likelier they for my default
Will claim the forfeit—with their death, poor souls!
Atone my trespass. But I thee implore
By the high Gods, and powers that know the truth,
By what remains to mortals anywhere
Of faith untarnished, pity woes like mine,
Pity a soul with unjust burdens bowed.'

"Life to his tears we grant and pity too:
Priam's own voice first bids the man be loosed
From grip of gyve and fetter, and thus speaks
With kindly word: 'Whoe'er thou art, henceforth,
As for the Greeks, forget them and forgo:
Ours shalt thou be, and to my questioning
Unfold true answers: this huge monster-horse
Why built they? by whom fathered? to what end?
A sacred symbol? or some tool of war?'
He had said: the other, well equipped with guile
And craft Pelasgian, to the stars upturned
His hands now fetterless: 'You, quenchless fires,
And your inviolable majesty
I call,' quoth he, 'to witness, and you too,
Altars and heinous swords which I escaped,
And garlands of the gods, my victim-gear;
Lawful it is for me to break my vows
Of fealty to the Greeks, lawful to hate
The men themselves, and bring to the light of day
Whate'er they shroud in darkness, nor am I
Holden by any of my country's laws:
Only do thou stand by thy plighted word,
Troy, and, safeguarded, guard thy promise safe,
If truth I tell, if richly thee repay.

" 'All hope and courage for the war's emprise
On Pallas' help the Danaans ever stayed:
But from what time, with Tydeus' impious son,
Ulysses, crime-contriver, dared to rend
Doom-fraught Palladium from its hallowed shrine,
And slew the watchmen of her castled height,
And snatched the sacred image, and feared not
With hands blood-reeking to contaminate
Her godhead's maiden fillets, from henceforth
The Danaans' hope in ebb slid ever back,
Crushed was their strength, the goddess' heart estranged.
Nor doubtful the dread signs Tritonia gave;
Scarce was her semblance lodged within the camp,
When from the upturned eyes shot quivering flames,
A salt sweat coursed along the limbs, and thrice—
Wondrous to tell—of her own self she sprang
From earth shield-laden, and with spear that shook.
Calchas at once with prophet-voice bids brave
Ocean in flight, for that no Argive arms
Could uptear Pergamus, except they seek
At Argos for new omens, and bring back
That will of heaven, which erst they bare away
O'er ocean with them in their curved keels.
And now that homeward-wafted they have sought
Mycenae, 'tis to get them arms, and gods
For their way-fellows, and, the sea recrossed,
They will be here unlooked for. In such wise
Doth Calchas sort the omens. Warned by him
They reared this image in Palladium's place,
For outraged godhead, their dark crime to quit.
But to this monstrous height of woven planks
Calchas bade lift it and upbuild to heaven,
Lest through your gates it be received, or drawn
Within the ramparts, and so shield your folk
Beneath their ancient worship. For if hand
Of yours had wronged Minerva's offering,
Mighty destruction then—which augury
May heaven first turn upon himself!—would fall
On Priam's empire and the Phrygians; but
If by your hands your city it should scale,

Asia herself should in a mighty war
Assail the walls of Pelops, and such doom
Remain in store for our posterity.’

“By such decoys of Sinon’s art forsworn
The tale got credence, and by craft were caught
And forced tears, whom neither Tydeus’ son,
No, nor Achilles of Larissa, nor
Ten years had conquered, nor a thousand keels.

“A mightier portent and more fearful far,
Poor souls! here bursts upon them, and confounds
Their blinded senses. For Laocoon,
The priest of Neptune, as by lot assigned,
Was sacrificing at the wonted shrine
A mighty bull, when, lo! from Tenedos,
Over the tranquil ocean serpents twain—
I shudder to recount it— with huge coils
Cumbering the deep, ply shoreward side by side;
Reared on the surge their breasts and blood-red manes
O’ertop the billows; the remaining bulk
Skims ocean aft in labyrinthine folds:

## THE AENEID II

Hark! how the brine seethes audibly! and now,
Their glowing eyes with blood suffused and fire,
The shore-fields they were gaining, and their chaps
Hissed, as with flickering tongues they licked them; we
Pale at the sight fly scattered; they with line
Unwavering at Laocoon aim, and first
His two sons’ slender bodies either snake
Embraces and enfolds, and gnawing feeds
Upon the hapless limbs; then him they seize
Up-hurrying armed to aid them, and bind fast
With mighty spires, and now—their scaly length
Twice wreathed about his waist, twice round his neck—
With heads o’ertop him and high-towering throats.
He, while to rend their knots he strives amain,
His fillets with black venom drenched and gore,
Uplifts to heaven heart-piercing shrieks; as when,
’Scaped from the altar, bellows a maimed bull,
That from his neck shakes off the erring axe.
But to the temple’s height that dragon pair
Gliding escape, and seek the citadel
Of fell Tritonia, to find covert close
Under the goddess’ feet and orbed shield.
Then through the trembling hearts of all there crept
Strange fear; and ‘rightly hath Laocoon
Paid for his crime,’ they cry, ‘with point of spear
Wounding the hallowed wood, what time he hurled
His guilty lance against the flank.’ Then all
Shout that the image to her shrine be drawn,
And supplication to the goddess made.
We cleave the city-walls, the ramparts ope;
All gird them to the task, beneath the hoofs
Set wheels a-gliding, and around the neck
Stretch hempen hawsers; with war-laden womb
The doom-fraught engine scales the walls: around
Boys and unwedded girls sing litanies,
And joy to touch the cable with their hands.
And so it enters, and glides threateningly
Into the city’s midst. Land of my birth!
O Ilium, home of gods, and, famed in war,
Ye Dardan battlements! four times it stopped
At the gate’s very threshold, and four times
From out its entrails came a clash of arms.
But frenzy-blinded we press heedless on,
And in our hallowed citadel uprear
The luckless prodigy. Then, even then,

## THE AENEID II

Cassandra for the coming doom unlocks
Those lips ne’er trusted by the sons of Troy—
So heaven decreed it: we, that day our last,
Fond wretches! range the city, and festoon
With gala-boughs the temples of the gods.

“Meanwhile the face of heaven is turned, and night
Comes up from ocean, in its mighty shade
Both earth and sky, and Myrmidonian wiles
Enveloping: stretched silent on the walls
The Teucrians lay; sleep held their weary limbs.

Even now the Argive host from Tenedos
With vessels in array was wending on,
Through the kind stillness of the silent moon
Seeking the well-known shore, when sudden, lo!
The royal galley reared her signal-fires,
And, shielded by the gods’ unequal doom,
Sinon by stealth lets loose the pinewood bolts,
And womb-imprisoned Danai. Them the horse
Restores, thrown open, to the light of day.
And from the hollow frame exultant leap
Thessander, Sthenelus, those lords of war,
And dread Ulysses, by the lowered rope
Down-gliding; Acamas, and Thoas, and
Son’s son of Peleus, Neoptolemus,
And first Machaon, Menelaus too,
Ay, and Epeus, framer of the fraud.
These storm the town, buried in sleep and wine;
The guards are slain; through the wide portals all
Let in their friends, and join the federate band.

“It was the time when the first slumber falls
On suffering mortals, by the high God’s gift
Then sweetliest stealing o’er them: lo! in sleep
Hector before mine eyes, all woe-begone,
Seemed then to stand, and shower down floods of tears;
Torn by the dragging chariot, as of old,
And black with blood-stained dust,—his swollen feet
Pierced with the thong. Ah! what a sight he was!
How all unlike that Hector, who returned
Clad in Achilles’ arms, the spoils of war,
Or fresh from hurling on the Danaan decks
The fires of Phrygia! now with draggled beard,
And hair blood-clotted, wearing all those wounds
So thickly dealt him round his native walls!
Weeping myself, I first, methought, addressed
The hero, and drew forth these sorrowing words:

## THE AENEID II

‘Light of the Dardan land, O staunchest hope
Of Teucria’s sons, say why this long delay?
Or from what borders, Hector, art thou come,
Much looked for? is it thus that, wearied out
With all the myriad slaughters of thy friends,
City and townsmen’s ever-changing woes,
Our eyes behold thee? What unseemly cause
Hath marred thy cloudless features? or what mean
These wounds I gaze on?’ Not a word spake he,
Nor recked mine idle questioning, but groan
On laboured groan from out his bosom’s depth
Upheaving, ‘Ah! fly, goddess-born,’ he said,
‘And snatch thee from the flames: the foemen hath
Our walls, and Troy from her proud summit sinks.
Enough to king and country hath been given:
If any hand could Pergamus have saved,
Then mine had saved it: Troy commits to thee
Her worship and her household gods; these take
As comrades of thy destinies; for these
Seek out a mighty city thou at length
Shalt rear thee, having roamed wide ocean o’er.’
Such words he spake, and in his hands bare forth
The sacred fillets from the inmost shrine,
And Vesta’s might, and her undying fire.

“Meantime the walls grow one confused scene
Of widespread anguish; and, though far withdrawn
My sire Anchises’ palace amid trees
Lay sheltered, ever louder and more loud
Surges the din, swells out the alarm of war.
I start from sleep, to the high roof-top mount,
And stand, all ear, to hearken: as, when fire
Falls on the corn beneath the furious south,
Or ravening torrent from a mountain flood
Lays low the fields, lays low the laughing crops,
The oxen’s labour, and drags forests down
Headlong, the hind from some tall craggy peak
Mute with amaze stands listening to the roar.
Then is the bare truth self-attested, then
The Danaan wiles unmask them; see e’en now
The house of Deiphobus a vast ruin yawns
O’ertopped by Vulcan! see his neighbour too
Ucalegon in flames! Sigeum’s gulf
Reflects the blaze afar. Up goes to heaven
Shouting of men, and clarion’s bray; distraught
I seize mine arms, though arms lack argument;
But my heart burns to mass a warrior-band,

## THE AENEID II

And with my comrades hasten to the hold:
Frenzy and anger urge my headlong will,
And death methinks how comely, sword in hand!
“But Panthus, from the Achaean darts escaped,
Panthus, the son of Othrys, see! and priest
Of Phoebus on the height, in his own hand
The sacred emblems of the vanquished gods,
And dragging his young grandchild after him,
Nigh at wits’ end comes hurrying to my door.
‘Panthus, how stands the fortune of the day?
What point of vantage seize we?’ Scarce had I
Uttered the words when, groaning, he replies:
‘The latest day, the inevitable hour,
Has dawned on Dardan land; we, Trojans once,
And Ilium, and the Teucrians’ giant fame
Have been, and are not; Jove’s remorseless will
From us to Argos hath borne all away;
Our town’s a-flame; the Danaans lord it there.
Towering amidst the city-walls erect
The horse rains armed warriors! Far and near
Sinon with victor-insolence spreads wide
The conflagration. Through the folding gates
Some enter, myriads countless as e’er came
From great Mycenae; some, to bar our path,
With weapons have beset the narrow ways,
A wall of steel-blade edges flashing bare,
For death-blow dight: scarce seek the foremost guards
To hold the gates against them, or maintain
The blindfold conflict.’ At such words as these
From Othrys’ son, and at the doom of heaven,
I rush into the midst of fire and fray,
Where the grim Fury, where the battle-din
Me summons, and the shouts uptossed to heaven.
Then, lo! by moonlight borne across my path,
Rhipeus, and Epytus, right brave in arms,
And Hypanis and Dymas join with me,
And gather to my side, and Mygdon’s child,
The youth Coroebus. In those days it chanced
He, with mad passion for Cassandra fired,
Had come to Troy, and as a son was now
To Priam and the Phrygians lending aid,
Unhappy, not to heed the warning voice
Of his heaven-frenzied bride. Whom when I saw
Close-banded and with stomach for the fray
I thus the more exhort them: ‘Warrior-hearts,
Dauntless in vain, if your desire be set

## THE AENEID II

On following one who dares the bitter end,
Our fortune’s plight how desperate, ye may see:
Gone are the gods, from shrine and altar fled,
Aye, one and all, by whom this empire stood:
The town ye seek to succour is in flames;
Then die we, plunging into the battle’s midst;
One safety hath defeat—to hope for none!’
Thus were the warriors’ souls to frenzy wrought.
Then like to ravening wolves in a black mist,
Whose belly-rage unbridled drives them forth
To grope for prey—their cubs left lone the while
With droughty jaws await them—on we press
Through darts, through foemen, to no doubtful doom,
Thridding the city’s midst: Night’s ebon wings
Float round us with their overarching shade.
Who could unfold the havoc of that night,
Tell o’er the slain, or match our teen with tears?
Stoops to her fall our ancient city, she
The empress of the ages. Through her streets
And homes, and hallowed thresholds of the gods,
Heap upon heap the dead lie strewn and stark:
Nor Teucrians only pay the bloody debt;
Sometimes, though vanquished, to their heart returns
Valour, and down the conquering Danai go.
Look where you will, heart-rending agony
And panic reign, and many a shape of death.

“First to confront us, with a mighty band
Of Danai backed, behold Androgeos,
Who, all unconscious, taking foes for friends,
Thus as a comrade hails us: ‘Haste, my men!
What laggard sloth retards you? Others, see!
Amid her flames are plundering Pergamus,
While ye from your tall ships are newly come.’
He said, and, greeted with no sure reply,
Knew in a moment fallen amid foes.
Staggered, both foot and voice he backward drew.
As one, who, struggling with rough briars, hath trod
At unawares a serpent underfoot,
Starts back in sudden terror, as it rears
Its wrath on high, and puffs a purple throat.
Not otherwise, confounded at the sight,
Androgeos was retreating. On we rush,
With serried arms enclose them, and on ground
They knew not, and with terror ta’en aback,
Slay them on every side. So fortune’s breath

## THE AENEID II

Fans our first effort. Here Coroebus cries,
Waxed jubilant with courage and success:
‘Where fortune at the outset, comrades mine,
With such clear signs of friendship points the path,
Be ours to follow: change we shields and don
The Danaan emblems. Craft or prowess, which,
Who cares to ask in dealing with a foe?
Themselves shall furnish us with arms.’ So saying,
The plumed helmet of Androgeos
He next puts on, with buckler blazoned fair,
And girds an Argive sword upon his thigh.
The like does Rhipeus, ay and Dymas too,
And all our youth exulting; every man
Arms him from out the recent spoil; then on
We press, commingling with the Danaan ranks.
Led by no god of ours, and hand to hand
Through the blind night wage many a battle-bout,
Send many Danaans to the shades below.
This way and that they fly, some to the ships,
Seeking at headlong speed the trusty shore;
Some clambering up the monster-horse again,
Vile dastards, hide them in the well-known womb.
Ah! not for men to trust, if gods be loath!
See where, with locks that stream upon the wind,
Maiden Cassandra, Priam’s daughter, comes
Haled from the temple and Minerva’s shrine;
Vainly to heaven her burning eyes she casts—
Eyes, for her tender hands are locked in chains.
This sight Coroebus brooked not; mad with rage
He hurled him on their very midst, to die.
We following all in close array rush on.
Here first from the high temple’s top o’erwhelmed
With friendly darts, most piteous slaughter falls
Upon us, through the aspect of our arms,
And lying semblance of our Grecian crests.
Then too the Danai, with a groan of wrath
For the maid’s rescue, mustering from all sides,
Fall on—impetuous Ajax, and the twin
Atridae, and all the host of Dolopes;
Even as at times, when a tornado bursts,
Winds meet in shock of battle, West, and South,
And East exulting in his orient steeds;
The forest creaks, and Nereus, all a-foam,
Storms with his trident, from its lowest depth
Upchurning all the ocean. Such beside
As through the darkness in the gloom of night

## THE AENEID II

We routed by our stratagem, and chased
The city’s length, appear, and first are they
Our shields and lying weapons to discern,
And mark the incongruous accent of our tongues.
Straightway we are outnumbered and overwhelmed;
And first Coroebus at the altar-steps
Slain of the warrior-goddess, by thy hand,
Peneleos, bites the dust: falls Rhipeus too,
Of all the Teucrians foremost without peer
For justice and fast-cleaving to the right:
The gods willed otherwise: next, pierced by friends,
Both Hypanis and Dymas are laid low;
Nor all thy goodness, Panthus, no, nor could
Apollo’s fillet shield thee in thy fall.
Ashes of Ilium, and ye funeral-fires
Of my lost friends, witness, when ye went down,
I shunned no Danaan missiles, and no chance
Of blow for blow, that, had fate willed my fall,
This arm had earned it. Sundered from the rest
With me are Iphitus and Pelias,
Iphitus age-encumbered, Pelias
Sore-wounded by Ulysses. Straight we hie
Toward Priam’s palace, by the shouting led.
But here a giant conflict we behold,
As warring else were nowhere, none beside
Dying the city through; so stubborn raged
The war-god, while the Danai roofward rush,
And the shield-tortoise driven besets the door.
Close cleave their ladders to the walls, and nigh
The very entrance up the rungs they press,
With left hands shielded intercept the darts,
And with the right clutch fast the battlements.
Meanwhile the Dardans, see! upwrench amain
Turret and roofing-tile; with these for darts,
Seeing the end, in death’s extremity,
They stand on their defence; some topple down
August ancestral splendours—gilded beams;
Others with drawn blades block the doors below,
And guard them densely massed; fresh heart I take
To aid the palace, ease with help our men,
Add vigour to the vanquished.

“There was set
An entrance by a hidden door that led
From hall to hall of Priam, posternwise
Left rearward of the palace, by the which
While yet the empire stood, Andromache,

## THE AENEID II

Poor heart! would ofttimes unattended seek
Her royal kinsfolk, to his grandsire’s knee,
Leading her little son Astyanax.
Mounting, I gain the summit of the pile,
From whence the wretched Teucrians hurled amain
Their ineffectual darts. A turret stands
On the sheer edge, with its high pinnacle
Reared to the stars, whence Troy would oft be viewed,
The Danaan ships too, and the Achaean camp:
This, armed with tools, assail we round about,
Where the high floor-joists lend a tottering hold,
And from its deep bed wrench, and hurl it: lo!
Suddenly with a crash down, down it goes,
Trailing wild havoc on the Danaan ranks:
But up come others, and meanwhile the storm
Of stones and motley missiles knows no stay.
Hard on the threshold, by the very door,
Pyrrhus exults, flashing in armed sheen:
As when a serpent fed on poisonous weeds,
By winter-frosts kept swollen underground,
Fresh from the shedding of his slough, with youth
New-burnished, rolls his slippery length to light,
And, sunward towering with uplifted breast,
Flickers the three-forked lightning of his tongue.
With him huge Periphas, and Automedon,
Achilles’ charioteer, who bare his arms,
And all the flower of Scyros, storm the walls,
And at the roof fling fire. In front of all,
Gripping a two-edged axe, himself is there,
Bursting the tough doors through, and from their hinge
The brass-bound valves divorcing: see! even now
He has hewn a beam out, scooped the stubborn oak,
And made a monstrous and wide-yawning breach.
The inner palace and far-lengthening halls
Ope and lie bare, the secret sanctuary
Of Priam and the kings of long ago;
And standing on the threshold’s edge they see
Arm’d warriors.

“But confusion reigns within,
Wild shrieks and piteous uproar; far-withdrawn
The hollow chambers, hark! with woman’s plaints
Are wailing: the cry strikes the golden stars.
Then through the wide halls trembling matrons stray,

## THE AENEID II

And, fondly clinging, clasp the doors and kiss.
On presses Pyrrhus with his father’s might;
Nor barriers, no, nor guards his onset brook;
With quick blows of the battering-ram the door
Totters, the valves fall forward from the hinge:
Force cleaves a way: the Danaans flooding in
Burst them a passage, cut the foremost down,
And fill the wide space with their soldiery:
Not all so madly doth a foaming flood
Burst through the barrier of opposing banks
With conquering swirl, then, raging on a heap,
O’er-ride the country, and through all the plain
Sweep byre and herd before it. I myself
Saw mad with slaughter Neoptolemus,
And both the Atridae on the threshold; aye,
And Hecuba with daughters and sons’ brides
A hundred, and, along the altar stretched,
Priam, polluting with his own heart’s blood
The fires himself had consecrated. All
Those fifty bridal chambers, the rich hope
Of children’s children, portals proudly dight
With trophies and barbaric gold, lie low;
And still the Danai swarm where fails the fire.

“Haply of Priam’s fate would’st also hear.
Soon as he saw the city stormed and fallen,
His palace doors wrenched open, and the foe
Amid his inmost chambers, the old man
About his shoulders, palsied now with age,
Binds, unavailing, long-forgotten arms,
Then girds him with his helpless sword, and, where
The foe throngs thickest, turns his steps to die.
Midmost the palace, under heaven’s bare vault,
Stood a huge altar, and a bay-tree near,
Of immemorial age, drooped over it,
Embracing in its shade the household gods.
Here round the unavailing altar-stone,
Like doves swept headlong by a murky storm,
Hecuba and her daughters huddling cowered,
Clasping the sacred images. But when
Priam she saw in arms of youth arrayed,
‘Ah! my unhappy lord, what thought so dire
Pricked thee to don this battle-gear?’ she cried,
‘And whither bound so hotly? Not for such
Succour or such defenders craves the time,
No, not were my own Hector now at hand.

## THE AENEID II

Enough, withdraw thee hither: all shall be
Saved by this altar, or thou slain with us.’
So spake she, and drew towards her, and set down
Her aged lord upon the hallowed seat.

“But lo! from Pyrrhus’ slaughtering sword escaped,
Polites, one of Priam’s sons, through darts,
Through foemen, the long corridors adown
Comes flying, and traverses the empty court,
Wounded. Him Pyrrhus with pursuing stroke
Plies hotly, and all but within his grasp
Holds even now, and pricks him with his spear:
Bursting at length upon his parents’ view,
Before their very eyes prostrate he fell,
And poured his life out in a rush of blood.
Then Priam, though fast within the net of death,
Brake all restraint, nor voice nor passion spared.
‘For crime so shameless may the gods,’ he cries,
‘If justice be in heaven such deeds to mark,
Pay thee due thanks, fair meed requite thee, who
Hast forced mine own son’s murder on my sight,
And with his death profaned a father’s eyes:
But he—thou best to call thyself his son—
Achilles, erst with Priam, though a foe,
Dealt otherwise; with kindling shame he owned
A suppliant’s rights and honour, rendered up
The bloodless corse of Hector for the tomb,
And sent me to my realm again.’ So saying,
The old man heaved a weak and woundless spear,
Which, straightway by the clanging brass repelled,
From the shield’s outer boss-rim harmless hung.
‘Therefore,’ said Pyrrhus, ‘shalt thou bear the news,
And to my sire the son of Peleus go:
Look that thou tell him of my sorry deeds,
And how degenerate Neoptolemus;
Now die.’ So speaking, to the altar’s self
He haled him trembling, slipping in a pool
Of his son’s blood, and wreathing in the hair
His left hand, with the right flashed out his sword,
And plunged it in his body to the hilt.
Such was the goal of Priam’s destinies;
Such end befell him, with his eyes to see
Troy burnt, and Pergamus to ruin fallen,
Erewhile o’er many nations, many lands,
The haughty lord of Asia. There he lies
A vast trunk stretched along the sand, a head
Shorn from the shoulders, and a nameless corse.
“Then first fell horror closed me round; I stood
Amazed: uprose the form of my loved sire,
As I beheld the king, in age his peer,
Cruelly wounded, gasping out his life.
Rose to my mind Creusa too, left lone,
And my house plundered, and the plight of young
Iulus. I look back to scan what force
Is yet around me: one and all worn out
Have vanished from my side, cast them to earth
Headlong, or, fainting, dropped into the flames.

“Now was I left alone, when I discern
Clinging to Vesta’s shrine, and silently
Lurking within her solitary cell,
The daughter of Tyndareos: the fierce glare
Of conflagration lends me light to stray,
And cast my eyes o’er all things, far and near.
She, with a dread foreboding in her heart
Of Teucrian hate for Pergamus o’erthrown,
And Danaan retribution, and the wrath
Of her forsaken lord—she, common fiend
Of Troy and her own country, hidden close,
Couched by the altar from the scorn of men.
At once my soul caught fire, and rising wrath
Prompts to avenge my country, and exact
The wage of wickedness. Shall she forsooth
Live to see Sparta, and her native town
Mycenae? in the triumph she has won
Walk as a queen, and with her eyes behold
Husband and home, her parents and her sons,
Thronged round with Ilian women, and a train
Of Phrygian bondsmen? What! with Priam slain,
Troy burnt to ashes, and the Dardan shore
Bedewed so often with the sweat of blood!
Not so: albeit no memorable name
By woman’s death be won, nor triumph yield
Such victory, yet to have wiped out a pest,
Wreaked worthy punishment, shall be my praise,
My joy to surfeit in avenging fire,
And to have slaked the ashes of my friends.
Such words outflinging, and by rage of heart
Transported, sudden to my sight is borne,
Never till now so dazzling to behold,
And in pure radiance beaming through the night,
My gentle mother—goddess undisguised—
Such and so stately as her form appears

## THE AENEID II

To sons of heaven: she held me by the hand,
And thus, moreover, spake with rosy lips:
‘Son, what fierce anguish in thy bosom stirs
Ungovernable wrath? why ragest thou?
Thy care for me fled whither? Wilt thou not
See first where thou hast left thine age-worn sire,
Anchises, whether still survive thy wife
Creusa and Ascanius thy child?
Whom all ere this, encompassed every side
By prowling Greeks, did not my care prevent,
Or flames had snatched, or foeman’s sword devoured.
Think not it is the hated face of her,
The Spartan daughter of Tyndareos,
No, nor much blamed Paris, but the gods,
The gods, whose unrelenting hate overturns
This empire, and Troy’s loftiness brings low.
Look—for the cloud which, o’er thy vision drawn,
Dulls mortal sight, and spreads a misty murk,
I will snatch from thee utterly: but thou
Fear not thy mother’s bidding, nor refuse
Her hests to hearken—here where thou but seest
Huge shattered fragments and stone rent from stone,
And dust and smoke blent in one surging sea,
Neptune with his vast trident shakes the walls,
And heaves the deep foundations, from her bed
O’ertoppling all the city. Juno here
Storms at the entrance of the Scaean gate,
Implacable, and raging, sword on thigh,
Summons her armed confederates from the ships.
Now backward glance, and on the embattled height
Already see Tritonian Pallas throned,
Flashing with storm-cloud and with Gorgon fell.
The Sire himself each Danaan heart imbues
With courage and victorious might; himself
Against our Dardan power stirs up the gods.
Son, snatch at flight, and let thine efforts end:
Nowhere will I forsake thee till set safe
Upon thy father’s threshold.’ She had said,
And vanished in thick shadows of the night.
Dread forms appear, and mighty potentates
Of heaven, at feud with Troy.

“Ah! then mine eyes
Beheld all Ilium settling into flame,
Troy, Neptune’s city, from her base o’erthrown;
As some hoar ash-tree on the mountain-tops,
Which eager husbandmen make haste to fell,

## THE AENEID II

With steel and showering axe-strokes hacked and hewn,
Threatens and ever threatens, and nods on
With quaking foliage, rocking crest, until,
Little by little, ’neath the wounds o’erpowered,
One dying groan it utters, and falls stretched
Along the hillside, a root-severed wreck.
I get me down, and with the god to guide
Through fire and foes win unimpeded way;
Weapons give place to me, and flames retire.

“So when at last my father’s door was gained,
And the old home, my sire, whom first I seek—
My first thought now to bear him to the hills—
Refuses to live on, Troy laid in dust,
Or stoop to exile. ‘Ye, whose blood,’ he cried,
‘Hath yet youth’s freshness, and whose strength
Stands whole
In native vigour, do ye speed your flight;
Me had the high gods destined to survive,
They would have spared my home. Enough and more
That I have seen one downfall, and outlived
The capture of our city: here, even here,
Lay out my body, and bid farewell, and go.
This hand shall find out death; the foe will take
Pity on me, and hunger for my spoil.
Light is the loss of burial. Long ago
Hateful to heaven and useless, I drag on
My lingering days, e’er since the Sire of gods
And King of men breathed on me with the blast
Of his winged bolt, and touched me with his fire.’

“So spake he, and stood firm, persisting; we,
My wife Creusa, and Ascanius,
And the whole house, beseech him, bathed in tears,
Not to whelm all in his own ruin, nor add
Weight to the push of doom: he spurns our prayer,
Stands rooted to his purpose and the spot.
Once more I turn to arms, and long for death
To end my misery; for what counsel now,
What fortune was vouchsafed me? ‘Didst thou think
That I could leave thee, sire, and go my way?
Fell word so monstrous from a father’s lips?
If it be writ in heaven that naught remain
Of all this city, and thy fixed purpose hold,
So fain to heap upon Troy’s funeral-pyre

## The *Aeneid* II

Thyself and thine, death opes thee wide the door:
And, fresh from bathing in the blood of Priam,
Soon Pyrrhus will be here, who butchers son
In face of sire, and sire at altar-side.
For this then, gentle mother, did thy hand
Pluck me from sword and flame, that I might see
The foe upon my hearth-stone, see my sire,
Ascanius and Creusa at his side,
Slaughtered and weltering in each other’s blood? 667
Arms, arms, my men! their last reveille calls
The vanquished. To the Danai give me back:
Let me revisit and renew the fight:
Ne’er shall we all die unavenged to-day.’

“Therewith once more I gird my sword on, brace
And fit my left arm to the shield, and forth
Was hurrying from the house, when lo! my wife
Clasping my feet upon the threshold clung,
Held forth the young Iulus to his sire. 674
‘If bound for death, speed us with thee through all;
But if past effort teach thee still to place
Some hope in arms, then first defend our home.
Bethink thee to whose hand thou leavest us,
Thy sire, and young Iulus, and myself,
Once called thy wife.’ So loudly pleading she
Filled all the house with moans, when lo! there falls
A sudden portent marvellous to tell!
For, as betwixt their gaze and their embrace
His sorrowing parents held him, on the crown
See! of Iulus’ head a tongue of fire
Light-hovering shone, and, harmless to the touch,
Licked his soft locks, and round his temples fed. 684
We in a flutter of alarm shake out
The blazing hair, and with spring water strive
To quench the sacred flame; but joyfully
My sire Anchises with a starward gaze
Lifted his voice and upturned hands to heaven.
‘Almighty Jupiter, if any prayer
Can bend thee, look upon us— only this;
And, if our goodness earn it, Sire, henceforth
Grant us thine aid, and ratify this sign.’
Scarce had the old man spoken, when there pealed
A sudden crash of thunder on the left;
And, gliding through the darkness from on high,
Shot with a torch-like trail of rushing light
A star; we mark it o’er the roof-top glide,
A fiery path displaying, and at length
Bury its brightness beneath Ida’s wood:
Then lo! a long-drawn furrow-line of light!
And o’er the region hangs a sulphurous smoke. 698
Conquered at last my sire uplifts his head,
Invokes the gods, adores the sacred star.
‘Up, up! no tarriance more! I follow, and where
Ye lead, am with you. Gods that guard our land,
Preserve my house, preserve my grandchild: yours
This omen, in your holy keeping Troy.
Son, I submit, content with thee to go.’

“He said; and through the streets more loudly now
Is heard the fire, and nearer roll the tides
Of conflagration. ‘Come then, father mine,
Mount thee upon my neck; these shoulders, see!
Shall bear thee up, nor feel that task a toil. 708
Come what come may, one peril both shall share,
Or one deliverance. Hand in hand with me
Let walk the child, Iulus, and my wife
Follow our footsteps from behind. And ye,
Servants, be mindful; heed what I shall say.
Quitting the city to a mound ye come
And ancient fane of Ceres in the waste:
Hard by, an aged cypress, by our sires
With holy awe regarded years on years.
To this one goal by divers tracks we’ll wend.
Father, do thou the sacred emblems take,
Our country’s household gods, within thy hand: 717
Fresh from the slaughter of so fierce a strife,
For me ’twere sin to touch them, till I wash
Me clean in running water.’ So I spake
And, over my broad shoulders and bowed neck
Donning for robe a tawny lion’s hide,
Stoop to the burden; twines his hand in mine
The child Iulus, with unequal steps
Following his sire: my wife comes on behind.
Forth fare we through the shady ways, and me
Whom erst no showering missiles could make blench,
Nor banded Greeks in hostile ranks arrayed,
Now every breeze affrights, and every sound
Startles, so tremulous am I, at once
Fearful for my companion and my load. 729

“And now, nearing the gates, the journey’s length
Methought I had o’erpast, when suddenly
A sound of hurrying footsteps to mine ear
Seemed borne, and, peering through the dark, my sire
Exclaims: ‘They are upon us: fly, son, fly!
I see their glowing shields and glittering arms!’
Then, in the scare, some Power that loved me not
Snatched my bewildered sense. For as I thrid
Untrodden paths, the wonted track forgo,
Alas! my wife Creusa, now by fate
Torn from me, to my sorrow, either stopped,
Or missed her way, or weary sat her down—
I know not— to our eyes restored no more.
Nor did I once look back to learn my loss,
Nor turn my thoughts upon her, till we reached
The mound of ancient Ceres and the shrine.
Then, then, of all our gathered forces, she
Alone was wanting to the way-fellows,
Slipped from the sight of husband and of son. 744
Whom in my frenzy did I not upbraid
Of men and gods? Or what more cruel hap
Saw in the falling city? Ascanius,
My sire Anchises, and Troy’s household gods
I give into my comrades’ care, and lodge
Safe in the winding vale, then seek once more
The city, and gird me in my glittering arms,
Steadfast to re-encounter every risk,
All Troy retraverse, and expose my life
Anew to every peril. I repair
First to the walls, and that dark portal, whence
My feet had issued, trace and follow back
Each step in the dark, and scan with searching eye. 757
The horror round, the very silence too
Scares me; then home I turn, if haply— ah!
If thither haply she had bent her steps.
The Danai had rushed in, filled all the house.
Speeds the devouring fire before the wind,
Rolled to the roof-top; now the flames outsoar it;
The billowy heat goes raging up to heaven.
Thence I pass onward, and cast eyes again
On Priam’s palace and the citadel.
Even now within the empty corridors
Of Juno’s sanctuary, as chosen guards,
Phoenix and dread Ulysses watch the spoil.
Hereinto gathered from her burning shrines,
Troy’s plundered treasure— tables of the gods,
Cups all of gold, and captive raiment, lie
Massed in a heap. About it in long line
Stand boys and trembling matrons. Nay, I dared
Even to launch my shouts into the dark,
Making the streets re-echo, as I called
‘Creusa’ and ‘Creusa,’ cry on cry,
With mournful iteration, but in vain. 770
Searching the city thus from house to house,
And raving without end, the hapless shade
And spectre of Creusa’s self appeared
Before me, statelier than the form I knew.
I stood aghast; my hair rose, and the voice
Stuck in my throat. Then thus, methought, she spake,
And with such words allayed my trouble: ‘Why
To frantic sorrow give such wanton way,
O my sweet lord? Without the nod of Heaven
These things befall not; at thy side to bear
Creusa hence— nor fate decrees, nor he
The lord of high Olympus suffers it.
Lo! exile long awaits thee, and to cleave
A vast expanse of ocean: then shalt thou
Arrive Hesperia, where with gentle march
Through their rich fields the Lydian Tiber flows. 782
High fortune here, a throne, a royal bride,
The Fates assign thee. Banish now thy tears
For loved Creusa: I shall never look
Upon the proud homes of the Myrmidons
Or Dolopes, ne’er go to be the slave
Of Grecian dames, a Dardan woman I,
Wed to the son of Venus the divine.
But me the mighty mother of the gods
Holds on this shore. And now adieu! Guard well
The love we cherished for thy child and mine.’
So saying, she left me weeping, yearning sore
To speak, and vanished into empty air. 791
Thrice, as she stood, my arms I would have flung
About her neck, and thrice my baffled hands
Closed upon nothing, and a form that fled,
Like to light breezes, one with winged sleep.
So passed the night, and so at length I turn
Back to my friends, and here with wonder find
New comrades, a vast concourse, matrons, men,
An army massed for exile— piteous throng!—
From all sides gathered, armed in heart and gear,
Where’er I list to lead them over sea.
And now o’er Ida’s topmost ridge the star
Of dawn was rising, bringing back the day:
The Danaans had beset and held the gates,
Nor hope of help was offered: I gave o’er,
Took up my sire and for the mountains made.” 804

## Book III

“When Asia’s realm and Priam’s guiltless race
The high gods doomed to overthrow, when fell
Proud Ilium, and all Neptune’s city Troy
In dust lay smoking, we are driven to seek
By auguries from heaven far outland homes
And lands unpeopled, and a fleet we build
Close underneath Antandros and the heights
Of Phrygian Ida, doubtful whither fate
Dooms us to journey, where vouchsafes to stay;
And men we muster. Scarce had summer dawned
When, as my sire Anchises now bade hoist
Sail to the breath of fate, with tears I quit
My native shores, the harbours, and the plains
Where once was Troy. An exile forth I fare
Upon the deep with comrades and with son,
My hearth’s Penates, and the mighty gods. 12

“There lies a land afar with widespread plains
Dear to the war-god, which the Thracians till,
Once swayed by fierce Lycurgus, from of old
With hospitable hearth-ties knit to Troy,
While yet her fortune stood. Hither I sail,
And, with fate frowning on my first essay,
Upon the winding shore trace city walls,
And, from my own name, name them Aeneadae.

“Unto Dione’s child, my mother, I,
And to the gods, was doing sacrifice,
As prosperers of our toil, to heaven’s high king
Slaughtering a sleek bull on the shore: hard by
A hillock stood with cornel-coppice crowned,
And myrtles bristling thick with spear-shaft wands. 25
Approaching, by main force I strove to pluck
The greenwood from the ground, that I might deck
With leafy boughs the altar, when a sight
Portentous meets my gaze, and strange to tell.
For from the first tree, torn with severed roots
From out the soil, trickle black gouts of blood,
That stain the earth with gore. My limbs quake, chilled
With horror, and cold fear congeals my blood.
A second stubborn wand once more I turn
To pluck me, and probe deep the hidden cause;
And black blood follows from the bark once more. 33
Much pondering in my heart, I ’gin to pray
The forest-nymphs and sire Gradivus too,
Guardian of Getic land, to prosper well
The vision, and make light the omen; but,
When for the third time, and with mightier heft,
The spear-wands I assail, and tug and strain
With bent knees ’gainst the opposing sand— should I
Speak or be silent? from the mounds’ recess
A piteous groan is heard, and to mine ears
An answer borne: ‘Why rendest thou a wretch
Like me, Aeneas? At last within my grave
Spare me, and spare those righteous hands to stain.
Troy-born am I, no alien to thee,
Nor from a mere log flow these blood-drops: ah!
Fly, fly the ruthless land, the shore of greed; 44
For I am Polydorus, here transfixed
And overwhelmed by crop of iron spears
With pointed pikes upspringing.’ Then, indeed,
Quelled with distracting fear I stood amazed:
My hair rose, and the voice stuck in my throat.
“This Polydorus, with vast weight of gold,
Unhappy Priam erst had secretly
To care of Thracia’s king consigned, when now
Misdoubting of the Dardan arms, he saw
His city girdled by the leaguers’ ring. 52
But Teucria’s power once crushed, her fortune fled.
The Thracian, following the victorious arms
And star of Agamemnon, snaps all ties
Of honour, and, Polydorus done to death,
Lays his rude gripe upon the gold. To what
Drivest thou not man’s heart, O lust of gold
Accursed? When the trembling left my frame,
To chosen heads of the people I recount—
My sire in chief— the portents of the gods,
Demand their judgement. All are of one mind
To quit the land of crime, fly friendship stained,
And give our fleet the south wind. So we pay
The rites of death to Polydorus, heap
A huge mound o’er him: altars to his shade
Sad with blue fillets and black cypress stand.
And round them, with locks loosed in wonted wise,
The Ilian women: cups of milk a-foam
Yet warm, and bowls of consecrated blood
We offer, and lay the spirit in the tomb,
And with loud voices raise the farewell cry. 68
“Soon as the deep gave promise fair, and winds
Had lulled the main, and Auster soughing low
Gave seaward summons, to the beach my crews
Haul down the ships, and throng the shore. Then forth
From harbour fare we; lands and cities fade.
In the mid main a sacred home there lies.
Unto the Nereids’ mother dearer none,
Nor to Aegean Neptune: this of old
Around the shores and sea-rims wandering
With filial love the Bearer of the bow
To Myconos high-cragged and Gyarus bound,
And steadfast planting taught to laugh at storms.
Hither I sail; a safe port’s halcyon calm
Here greets the weary crews; to land we leap,
Worship Apollo’s town. King Anius—
King among men, and priest of Phoebus too—
Brow-bound with fillets and the sacred bay,
Speeds towards us; in Anchises an old friend
He knows; so, clasping hospitable hands,
His roof we enter. 83

“I was worshipping
The antique stone-built temple of the god:
‘Give us a home that shall be ours, O lord
Of Thymbra; ramparts to the way-worn give,
A breed of sons, a lasting city: keep
Unscathed Troy’s second bulwark, what remains
’Scaped from the Danai and Achilles fell.
Whom must we follow? whither bid’st us go?
Where fix our habitation? Father, grant
A sign from heaven, and sink into our souls.’

“Scarce had I spoke when suddenly meseemed
All things ’gan tremble, doors and sacred bay;
And the whole mountain moves; the shrine flies ope.
The cauldron rumbles. Prone to earth we fall,
While to our ears is borne a voice: ‘O sons
Of Dardanus long-suffering, that same land,
Which bare you first from your ancestral stem,
Shall to her fertile bosom welcome back:
Seek out your ancient mother; there shall reign
The house of Aeneas o’er the world’s wide shores,
And her sons’ sons, and all their seed to be.’ 95
So Phoebus: and a mighty joy arose
Confused, tumultuous; with one voice they cry,
‘What is this city whither Phoebus now
Summons the wanderers, bids them to return?’
Then, pondering records of the men of old,
Thus spake my sire: ‘Hearken, ye lords of Troy,
And learn what hopes are yours: amidst the main
Lies Crete, of mighty Jove the island, where
Mount Ida, and where the cradle of our race; 105
There in a hundred mighty towns folk dwell,
A realm most fertile, whence our earliest sire
Teucer, if rightly I recall the tale,
Was wafted first to the Rhoetean shore,
And chose a site for sovereignty; as yet
Nor Ilium nor the towers of Pergamus
Had stood: men dwelt in the low valleys; hence
The Mother, haunter of Mount Cybele,
The Corybantian cymbals, Ida’s grove;
Hence the close secret of her rites, and those
Yoked lions harnessed to her queenly car. 113
Up therefore! hie we where Heaven’s bidding leads,
Appease the winds, and seek the Gnosian realm:
Nor is’t a long course thither; Jove to aid,
The third dawn lands us on the Cretan shore.’
So saying, due offerings at the shrine he slays,
A bull for Neptune, a bull too for thee,
O fair Apollo, a lamb black for storm,
White for the favouring Zephyrs. 120

“Rumour flies
That Prince Idomeneus, a banished man,
Hath quit his father’s realm, the shores of Crete
Abandoned, that her hearths are void of foes,
Homes empty for our advent. Straight we leave
Ortygia’s harbour, and o’er ocean fly,
Past Naxos with her Bacchant-haunted heights,
And green Donysa, past Olearos,
And snowy Paros, and the Cyclades
Sprent o’er the main, and thrid we seas that race
By crowded islands: high the seamen’s shout
Rises amid their changeful toil: the crews
Bid make for Crete and for our sires: a breeze
Springing astern convoys us, and at length
To the Curetes’ ancient shores we glide. 131
So eagerly my chosen city’s walls
I ’gin to build, Pergamea calling it,
And bid my people glorying in the name
Cleave to their hearths, and rear a roofed hold.
Scarce were the ships hauled dry ashore, the youth
Busied with marriage and new fields to till—
I laws and homes assigning— when there fell
Upon men’s limbs from heaven’s infected arch
A sudden wasting, and on trees and crops
Piteous contagion— a year fraught with death.
They left their pleasant lives, or dragged about
Sick bodies; Sirius too baked bare the fields;
Grass withered; the sick crop denied her food. 144
Back to Ortygia’s oracle my sire
Bids us retraverse Ocean, and implore
The grace of Phoebus; to our weary plight
What end vouchsafes he, whence would have us seek
Aid for our trouble, whither steer our course?
“’Twas night: sleep held all creatures upon earth,
When lo! the sacred emblems of the gods,
The Phrygian Penates, out of Troy
Borne with me from amidst the blazing town
Seemed, as I lay in slumber, to stand forth
Before mine eyes, clear in a flood of light,
Where streamed the full moon through the casement-shaft,
Then thus to address me, and with these words allay
My trouble: ‘That which from Apollo’s lips,
Once wafted to Ortygia, thou shouldst learn,
Lo! here he utters, unsolicited
Sending us to thy very threshold. We,
Who from Dardania’s burning have thyself
And thine arms followed, in the fleet thou led’st
Crossing the swollen deep— even we no less
Will lift to heaven thy sons that shall be born,
Grant empire to thy city. But do thou
Found mighty ramparts for the mighty, nor
Shirk the long toil of flight. Shift hence thy home:
Not these the shores portended, nor in Crete
Doth Delian Apollo bid thee dwell. 166
There is a spot, by Greeks Hesperia named,
A land of old, mighty in arms, in soil
Prolific, which the Oenotrian heroes tilled,
Now by a later race called Italy,
If rumour lie not, from their leader’s name.
There is our sure home; hence sprang Dardanus,
And sire Iasius, founder of our race.
Arise, be glad, and to thy father old
Bear this no doubtful mandate, that he seek
Corythus and Ausonia’s land; the fields
Of Dicte Jove denies thee!’ Sore amazed
By such a vision and the voice of gods—
Nor was that slumber: face to face I seemed
Their mien, their wreathed locks to recognize,
And their divine regard, while a chill sweat
Over my whole frame ran— from bed I leap,
And raising voice and upturned hands to heaven,
Pour unpolluted offerings on the hearth.
That homage paid, exulting I make known
All to Anchises, point by point revealed. 179
The twofold line, the double stock, himself
Fooled by a new confusion of old lands,
He owns, then cries aloud, ‘Son, long the sport
Of Ilium’s fate, Cassandra erst alone
Chanted this hap to me: I now recall
She thus foretold our destiny, and oft
Invoked Hesperia, oft the Italian realm.
But that the Teucrians to Hesperia’s shore
Should come indeed, who could have thought it? Whom
Then would Cassandra’s prophecies have swayed?
Yield we to Phoebus’ warning, and pursue
The wiser course.’ He spake, and all with joy
His word obey; this second home we quit,
Leaving some few behind, and with sails set
Scour the waste ocean in our hollow barks. 191

“Soon as our galleys gained the open deep,
And now no longer land appeared, but lo!
Ocean on all sides, and on all sides sky,
There stood a dark-blue storm-cloud o’er my head
Laden with night and tempest, and the wave
Shuddered beneath the gloom. At once the winds
Roll up the sea, and mighty billows rise:
Scattered, we toss upon the weltering waste:
Clouds wrapped the daylight, dank night stole the sky,
And fire burst through the welkin, flash on flash.
We are hurled from out our course, and wander on
O’er the blind waters. Palinurus even
Vows he discerns not day from night in heaven,
Nor in mid-wave can mind him of the track. 202
For three full days dim with blind mist we drift
Upon the deep, as many starless nights.
On the fourth day at length land first was seen
To crown the horizon, opening out afar
Mountains and wreathed smoke. Down drop the sails,
We rise upon our oars; with eager strain
The seamen churn the foam, and sweep the blue. 208
“Saved from the waves, me first the Strophad shores
Receive; the Strophades— their Grecian name—
Lie in the great Ionian, island-haunts
Of fell Celaeno and her Harpy crew,
Since Phineus’ door closed on them, and they fled
Scared from their former board. More foul than they
No portent, and no fiercer plague or wrath
Of heaven e’er rose from out the Stygian wave.
Birds maiden-faced, their belly’s excrement
Most noisome, and with hooked hands and cheeks
Blanched with eternal famine. 218

“Hither then
Borne safe, and entering harbour, lo! we spy
Rich herds of oxen scattered o’er the plain,
And flocks too of the goat-tribe on the grass
Untended; we rush on them with the sword,
And call upon the gods and Jove himself
To share the spoil, then on the winding shore
Pile couches up, and feast on the rich fare.
But sudden from the hills with fearful swoop
The Harpies are upon us, and clap loud
Their hurtling wings, and snatch the food away,
Polluting all things with their filthy touch;
Fearful at once their cry, and foul their smell. 228
In deep recess beneath a hollow rock,
Curtained with trees and bristling shade, once more
We lay the board, renew the altar-fires:
When from a diverse point of heaven once more
Out of some hidden lair the clamorous rout
Come winging round the prey with hooked feet,
And taint the food with tasting. Then I charge
My comrades seize their weapons and make war
On the fell brood. As bidden they do, range swords
In the grass-covert, and hide shields from sight. 237
So when along the winding shore their swoop
Sounded, Misenus from his lofty watch
With hollow brass gives warning: to the assault
My comrades rush, and a strange warfare try—
To harry with the sword these ominous birds
Of ocean. But their feathers take no hurt,
Their flesh no wound, and, soaring swift on high,
They leave behind them the half-eaten prey
And their foul traces. One, Celaeno, perched
On a tall crag, ill-boding prophetess,
Breaks into heart-wrung utterance: ‘Is it war
For our kine slaughtered and our bullocks felled,
Sons of Laomedon— war, ye would wage
Against us, and the blameless Harpies drive
Forth from their father’s realm? Take then to heart
My words, and write them there: what prophecies
The Sire Omnipotent taught Phoebus once,
Phoebus Apollo me, I, mightiest
Of Furies, now make known to you: the goal
Ye seek is Italy; to Italy,
The winds invoking, shall ye come, be free
Her ports to enter: but your destined town
With walls ye shall not gird, till famine dire
And your outrageous onslaught upon us
Drive you to gnaw your tables and devour.’ 257
She spake, and to the forest winged her way.
As for my comrades, a quick chill of fear
Curdled the blood within them; their hearts fell;
No more with arms, but vows and prayers they now
Bid sue for grace, or be they goddesses,
Or dread ill-omened birds: aye, and my sire
Anchises from the shore with outspread hands
Calls on the mighty ones of heaven, proclaims
Due sacrifice: ‘Ye gods, avert their threats,
Such evil hap forfend, and with your peace
Preserve the good.’ Then bids he rend away
The rope from shore, uncoil and ease the sheets. 267
The south winds stretch our canvas: fast we fly
Over the foaming waters, borne along
As wind and helmsman summoned. Now appears
In the sea’s midst Zacynthus and her woods,
Dulichium, Same, and the towering cliffs
Of Neritos; we hurry by the rocks
Of Ithaca, Laertes’ realm, and curse
The land that gave to fell Ulysses birth.
Soon too Leucate’s stormy peaks, and lo!
Apollo, feared of seamen, heaves in sight:
Weary, for him we make, and enter so
The little town: our anchor from the prow
Is cast, the sterns stand ranged along the shore. 277
So beyond hope at length achieving land,
To Jove we purify us, with our vows
Kindling the altar, and crowd Actium’s shore
With Ilian games: my comrades strip, and ply,
All smooth with oil, their native wrestling-bouts,
Glad to have ’scaped so many Argive towns,
And through the midst of foes our flight pursued.
Meanwhile the sun rolls round the mighty year,
And winter’s icy north-winds fret the sea.
A shield of hollow brass, great Abas erst
Had wielded, on the portals’ front I fix,
And with this line commemorate the deed:
‘Aeneas’ spoil, from Danaan conquerors won,’
Then bid them quit the harbour, man the thwarts. 289
With eager zeal my comrades lash the sea,
And sweep the watery floor. Anon we let
Phaeacia’s airy summits drop from view,
And skirt Epirus’ shore, till entering
The harbour of Chaonia, we draw nigh
Buthrotum’s high-built city. Here a tale
Of things incredible assails our ears:
That Helenus, Priam’s son, was reigning now
O’er Grecian cities, master of the bride
And crown of Pyrrhus, son of Aeacus,
And that Andromache had thus once more
Passed to a lord of her own race. Amazed
I stood, and my heart burned with strange desire
To accost the hero, from his lips to learn
Fortunes so strange. On from the port I fare,
Leave fleet and shore behind me, when it chanced
That nigh the city, in a grove, where flowed
A mimic Simois, Andromache
Her yearly feast was offering, gifts of grief,
Unto the ashes, summoning the shade
To Hector’s tomb, which with green turf, though void,
She had hallowed, and twin altars, where to weep. 305
Soon as her wildered eyes my coming saw,
With Trojan arms about me, scared at such
A portent, her limbs stiffen in mid gaze,
Warmth left her frame, she swoons, and scarce at length
Breaks the long silence: ‘Is’t thy very face?
Com’st thou indeed with tidings, goddess-born,
A living man? or if the genial light
Hath faded from thee, where is Hector?’ So
With showers of tears she spake, and all the place
Filled with her shrieking. To that passionate cry
Scarce can I frame brief answer, and, much moved,
Gasp out in faltering accents: ‘I indeed
Live, and my life through all extremes drag on:
Doubt not, thine eyes see truly: ah! what chance
Hurled from that height of wedded love receives,
What fortune worthy of her past hath found,
Hector’s Andromache? art still the wife
Of Pyrrhus?’ With downcast eyes and bated breath
She spake: ‘O blest beyond all women else
The maiden child of Priam, bidden to die
’Neath Troy’s tall ramparts, at the foeman’s tomb,
She who ne’er brooked the casting of the lot,
Nor, captive, touched a conquering master’s bed! 324
We, our home burnt, o’er distant oceans borne,
Have from Achilles’ heir endured the pride
Of youthful insolence, borne him a son
In slavery: he, wooing afterward
Leda’s Hermione, and nuptial ties
With Lacedaemon, me to Helenus,
Bondmaid to bondsman did consign. But him
Orestes, with fierce love for his stol’n bride
Fired, and still goaded by the fiends of crime,
At his ancestral altars unaware,
Waylaid and slaughtered. Neoptolemus
Thus dying, a portion of the realm he swayed
Passed o’er to Helenus, who called the fields
Chaonian, and Chaonia all the land,
From Trojan Chaon, and topped the heights with this
New Pergamus and Ilian citadel. 336
But thou— what winds, what fates have shaped thy course?
Or what god driven unwitting to our shores?
How fares the boy Ascanius? lives he yet
And drinks the air of heaven?— whom while in Troy . . .

But still to his lost mother doth he yearn
With boyish love? Aeneas for his sire,
Hector his uncle— do these kindle him
To antique prowess, and mettle of a man?’
So poured she forth her sorrow, and long she wept
Idly, when lo! advancing from the walls,
The hero-son of Priam, Helenus,
Comes with a mighty train, and his old friends
He knows, and leads them to his home with joy,
But all his utterance broke with bursting tears. 348
At every forward step I recognize
Troy, but in little, here a Pergamus,
The model of the mighty, there, though parched,
A river that from Xanthus takes its name.
And clasp the portals of a Scaean gate.
Along with me the Teucrians too enjoy

## THE AENEID III

The friendly city; the king welcomed them
In spacious cloisters; midmost of the court
They poured out wine-libations, the meats set
On golden platters, goblets in their hand. 333

‘And now a day and yet another day
Has come and gone; the breeze invites our sails;
The south wind swells, and puffs the canvas out,
When, with these words approaching, I thus seek
An answer from the seer: ‘Thou son of Troy,
Interpreter of heaven, who dost the will
Of Phoebus know, the tripods, and the bays
Dear to the Clarian god, the stars, and tongues
Of birds, and omens of the flying wing,
Come tell me— for the favouring voice of heaven
Hath my whole course declared, and one and all
The gods with power divine urged me to make
For Italy, and distant lands explore;
Only Celaeno with her Harpy voice
Chants a strange portent horrible to tell,
Boding fierce wrath and hideous famine— say
What perils first am I to shun, or by
What clue surmount such heights of suffering?’ 368
Then with due sacrifice of slaughtered steers
First Helenus implores the grace of heaven,
Unbinds the fillets from his sacred brow,
And with his own hand to thy temple-gates,
O Phoebus, leads me, bewildered with excess
Of godhead, then at last with priestly lips
Chants this prophetic utterance: ‘Goddess-born—
For that thou journeyest over sea, led on
By mightier omens, plain the proof, so draws
The king of gods thy destinies, and turns
The shifting changes; such their circling course—
Few things of many, that thou mayst safer track
Strange seas, and settle in Ausonia’s port,
I will unfold thee: what remains to know
The sister-fates from Helenus withhold,
Saturnian Juno to his tongue denies. 380
First, Italy, which e’en now thou deemest near,
Fain blindly to attempt the neighbouring ports,
Long tracts of country, a long pathless way,
Divide from thee: aye, in Trinacrian waves
First must thine oar be bent, and thy ships pass
The salt Ausonian main, the infernal lakes,
Aeaean Circe’s isle, ere thou mayst found
Upon safe shore thy city. And tokens I

## THE AENEID III

Will give thee; do thou keep them stored in mind.
When by the wave of a sequestered stream
Thine anxious eye lights on a monstrous sow,
Under the holm-oaks on the margin laid,
With thirty head of swine new-littered, white,
Stretched out along the ground, white too the young
About her udders, know that there shall be
Thy city’s site, there a sure rest from toil. 393
And shudder not, though ye be doomed to gnaw
Your tables; for the Fates will find a way,
Apollo hear and aid you; but these shores,
This border of the Italian coast, that lies
Nearest, by waves of our own ocean washed,
Fly, for in all their towns dwell evil Greeks. 398
Here have the Locri from Narycia built
Cities, and Lyctian Idomeneus
Filled the Sallentine fields with soldiery.
Here stands Petelia, propped upon its wall,
The tiny town of Philoctetes, lord
Of Meliboea. Nay, when o’er the main
Wafted, thy fleet hath anchored, and ashore
On new-built altars thou shalt pay thy vows.
First with a purple robe o’er-veil thy locks,
Lest in mid-worship, while the sacred fires
Yet burn, a foeman’s face meet thine, and mar
The omens. And this ceremonial rite
So let thy comrades, as thyself, observe,
And in its holy use thy sons abide
Blameless. But when, departing thence, the wind
Shall waft thee nigh Sicilia’s coast, and when
Pelorum’s narrow bars asunder draw.
Cleave to the leftward land, the leftward sea.
Though long the circuit; shun the right, both shore
And water. For this region once, 'tis said,
By violence and huge convulsion torn—
Such power of change is in long lapse of time—
Leapt into twain, that were one land before,
Continuous; and amidst them broke the sea,
That with its waves cut off Hesperia’s side
From Sicily’s, and flowed, a narrow firth,
’Twixt fields and cities sundered, shore from shore. 419
The right side Scylla doth beset, the left
Implacable Charybdis, aye and thrice
In the deep whirl of her abyss sheer down
She sucks huge billows, and anon to heaven
Rears them in turn, and whips the stars with spray.

## THE AENEID III

But Scylla, penned in a blind cave’s recess,
Thrusts forth her mouth, drags vessels on the rocks—
Upward, of human visage, and a maid
Fair-breasted to the waist, beneath, a fish
Of bulk portentous, and with dolphin’s tail
Joined to wolf’s belly. Better to lag round
Trinacrian Pachynus as your goal,
The long slow circuit fetch, than once have seen
Deformed Scylla in her cavern vast,
And rocks that to her dark blue sea-dogs ring. 432
Aye, and if Helenus foreknoweth aught,
And as a seer win credence, if his soul
Brim with Apollo’s truth, one prescient word.
For all will I vouchsafe thee, goddess-born,
And urge the admonition o’er and o’er;
Great Juno’s godhead honour first with prayer;
To Juno chant thy willing vows, and quell
With suppliant gifts the mighty queen: for so
Victor at last, Trinacria left behind,
Shalt thou to Italy’s far bourne be sped. 440
Here landed, when to Cumae’s town thou comest.
The holy lakes, Avernus’ echoing groves,
Thou shalt the frenzied prophetess behold,
Who in a rock’s deep hollow chants the Fates,
To leaves committing characters and names.
All prophecies upon the leaves impressed
The maid in order ranges, left to lie
Shut up within the cavern: they remain
Unmoved in place, nor from their order stir,
But none the less, when with the turning hinge
A draught of air strikes, and the open door
Unsettles the light leaves, ne’er heeds she then
To catch them, as they flutter round the cave.
Restore their places, or fit line to line: 451
Men go their ways uncounselled, and detest
The Sibyl’s seat. There count no loss of time
Too dear, though comrades chide thee, though the voyage
Press and provoke thy sails to sea, and thou
Mightst fill their favouring hollows, but approach
The prophetess, and with thy prayers implore
Herself to chant the oracles, and unlock
Her willing lips in speech. She will unfold
The tribes of Italy, and wars to be,
How best to shun or suffer every toil,
And to thy prayer vouchsafe a prosperous voyage. 460

## THE AENEID III

Thus far my voice may warn thee: up, away!
And by thy deeds lift Troy in might to heaven.’

So spake the seer with kindly word, then gifts
Heavy with gold and carven ivory
Bids to the ships be brought, massed silver, stows
And Dodonean cauldrons in our keels,
A ring-wrought hauberk triple-twilled with gold,
And superb helmet, cone and flowing crest.
The arms of Neoptolemus. My sire
Has gifts too of his own: horses besides
And guides he sends with us, fills up the tale
Of oarsmen, and equips the crews with arms. 471

‘Meanwhile Anchises bids rig out the fleet
Nor longer dally with the wafting wind.
Him the interpreter of Phoebus then
With high regard addressed: ‘Anchises, deemed
Meet for the holy hand of Venus, loved
Of heaven, twice rescued from Troy’s falling towers,
There lies Ausonia’s land: make sail and seize it;
Yet hold the deep, pass by the nearer coast,
Needs must thou; of Ausonia, see, the tract
Apollo doth reveal lies yonder far. 479
Go forth,’ said he, ‘in thy son’s goodness blest!
Why lengthen words, delaying while I speak
The rising gales?’ Nor less Andromache,
Sad at the final parting, brings forth robes
With gold woof broidered for Ascanius.
And Phrygian scarf, nor scants the guerdon due,
But loads him with her loom-gifts, and thus speaks:
‘These too, as tokens of my hand, receive,
Dear boy, in witness of the lasting love
Of Hector’s wife Andromache; aye, take
The last gifts of thy kin, sole likeness thou
Still left me of my own Astyanax!
Such eyes, such hands, such looks he wore; his youth
Had now been ripening to like years with thine.’
I, as I left them, spake with rising tears: 492

‘Live, and be happy, ye, whose destined course
Is now accomplished; we from fate to fate
Must still be summoned, but your rest is won:
No plain of ocean need ye plough, pursue
No still-retreating far Ausonian fields.
A copy here of Xanthus, and a Troy

## THE AENEID III

Do ye behold which your own hands have made,
I trust with happier omen, and less apt
For Grecian inroad. But if ever I
To Tiber come, and Tiber’s bordering fields,
And see the ramparts to my race assigned.
Our sister cities and their kindred folk,
Here in Epirus, in Hesperia there,
Who boast the self-same founder, Dardanus,
The self-same fortunes, we will yet some day
Take, and of twain create one Troy in heart:
That task be left to our posterity.’ 505

‘On through the deep we speed, and skirt the near
Ceraunians, whence the way to Italy,
And shortest passage o’er the waves. Meanwhile,
The sun drops, and the hills are veiled in gloom.
On the earth’s welcome bosom, meting out
The oars by lot, we stretch us by the wave,
And, on the dry beach scattered, court repose;
Slumber bedews our weary limbs. Nor yet,
Driven by the Hours, was Night to her mid course
Attaining, when, no sluggard, from his couch
Springs Palinurus, every wind explores,
Catching the breeze with listening ears: he marks
All stars that swim the silent sky, surveys
Arcturus, and the showery Hyades,
The Twin Bears, and Orion armed in gold. 517
Seeing a set calm in a cloudless heaven,
Loudly he signals from the stern; our camp
Is broken up; we venture on the voyage,
Spreading our sail-wings. And Aurora now
Was reddening, and the stars were put to flight,
When in the distance we descry dim hills.
And Italy’s low coast-line. ‘Italy!’
First cries Achates; Italy our crews
Hail with a shout of triumph. Then my sire
Anchises wreathed a mighty bowl with flowers,
And filled with wine, and called upon the gods.
Standing upon the lofty stern. ‘Ye gods,
Lords both of land and ocean with their storms,
Waft us a fair course, and breathe favouring gales.’ 525
The wished-for breezes freshen, and the port
Widens with narrowing distance, and clear seen
The temple of Minerva tops the height.
My comrades furl the sails, and shoreward steer.
The harbour there by eastern waves is bent
Bow-wise; with salt spray foam the barrier cliffs;
The port itself lies hidden; the towering rocks
Lower their arms, on either side a wall;
The temple from the shore retires. Four steeds

## THE AENEID III

Here on the grass, first omen, I beheld,
Grazing the plain at large, and white as snow. 538
Then Prince Anchises: ‘War it is thou bringest,
O stranger-country! Steeds are armed for war,
And war these herds portend us. Yet at times
The same beasts use to bow them to the car,
And, yoked together, bear the friendly rein;
Yea, there is hope of peace too.’ Then we pray
To sacred Pallas, queen of clanging arms,
Who first with joy received us, and with heads
Before the altar veiled in Phrygian robe,
As Helenus had so straitly charged us, pay
To Argive Juno the full rites prescribed. 547
Then without stay, each solemn vow performed,
Shifting the sail-yard horns, we quit the homes
Of Greek-born folk, and their suspected fields.
Next, known to Hercules, if true the tale,
Tarentum’s gulf is sighted, while in front
Rises Lacinium’s goddess, Caulon’s heights,
Shipwrecking Scylaceum. Then, far off
Out of the deep comes looming into sight
Trinacrian Aetna, and a mighty moan
Of ocean hear we, and rocks buffeted
Afar, and broken sounds upon the beach;
The shoals leap up, and sand and surges mix. 557
Then Prince Anchises: ‘Doubtless this is that
Charybdis, these the crags and fearful rocks
That Helenus foretold. Rescue, my friends!
Rise on your oars together!’ Nought they fail
To do his bidding, and Palinurus first
To the waves leftward turns her groaning prow;
Leftward the whole fleet strain with oar and breeze.
On the arched billow we mount up to heaven.
And once more, as the floods fail under us,
Sink to the shades below. Thrice roared the rocks
Amid their craggy hollows, thrice we saw
The foam dashed up, and the stars raining spray. 567
Meanwhile, outwearied, wind and sun alike
Failed us, and, all unwitting of the track.
To the Cyclopes’ shores we drift.

‘There lies
A harbour sheltered from the wind’s approach,
Spacious itself; but Aetna hard at hand
With hideous ruin thunders, and anon
Shoots a dark cloud to heaven of whirling smoke
Pitch-black, with glowing ashes, and aloft

## THE AENEID III

Heaves balls of fire, and licks the stars, anon
Rocks and the uptorn entrails of the hill
Spews forth, and heaps the molten stones in air
Booming, and from his lowest depth upboils. 577
’Tis said the huge frame of Enceladus,
Half-burnt by lightning, ’neath this mountain mass
Lies buried, while giant Aetna, piled above,
Bursts into channels, and breathes forth the fire:
Oft as he shifts his side for weariness,
Trinacria’s whole bulk with the rumbling quakes,
And curtains heaven with smoke. Screened by the woods,
That night the monstrous portent we endure,
Yet cause of sound discern not: for no stars
Were burning, nor the vault was bright above
With constellations, but a dark pall hid
The heavens, and dead night held the moon in cloud. 587
‘And now the next dawn in the utmost east
Was breaking, and Aurora had dispelled
Dank shadows from the sky, when suddenly
Out of the woods, by extreme hunger worn,
Stalks the strange figure of an unknown man,
In piteous plight, and stretching suppliant hands
Toward the shore. We turn to gaze on him.
Ghastly his squalor, with a beard grown wild,
A garb thorn-fastened: in all else a Greek,
And in his country’s arms once sent to Troy.
He when our Dardan guise, our Trojan arms,
Far off he saw, a little at the sight
Hung back afeared, and stayed his steps, but soon
With tears and prayers ran headlong to the shore:
‘Now, by the stars, and by the gods above.
Aye, and this light of heaven we breathe, take me,
Ye Teucrians, I conjure you; bear me hence
To whatso land ye will; it shall suffice.
One of the Danaan fleet am I, I know it,
Own I assailed your Ilian hearths with war: 603
Wherefore, so heinous if my crime’s offence,
Fling me piecemeal into the waves, or drown
In the vast ocean. If I die, ’twill be
Joy to have died by human hands.’ So saying,
He clasped our knees, to our knees, writhing, clung.
We urge him say what, and from whence, he is,
Next, how by fortune bandied, to confess. 609
My sire Anchises, with no long delay,
Himself extends his right hand to the youth,

## THE AENEID III

And with the ready pledge assures him; he,
Fear banished, speaks at length: ‘An Ithacan
By birth am I, and comrade of ill-starred
Ulysses; Achaemenides my name;
Since poor my father Adamastus— would
That fortune still were mine!— I came to Troy.
Here in their haste these cruel doors to quit,
My friends forgot, and in the monstrous cave
Of Cyclops left me. 'Tis a house of gore
And bloody banquetings, huge, dim within;
Himself, uptowering, strikes the stars on high—
Ye gods, rid earth of such a plague!— by none
To be eyed lightly, or in speech addressed. 621
On wretches’ flesh and their dark blood he feeds.
I myself saw of our own number twain.
In the cave’s midst as he lay backward, clutched
By his huge hand, and dashed against the rock,
And the floor drenched and swimming with their blood—
Saw, when their limbs, all dripping with black gore,
He munched, the warm joints quivering ’twixt his teeth;
But not, I trow, unpunished: nor such things
Ulysses brooked, nor was the Ithacan
In that sore strait forgetful of himself. 629
For when, with feasting gorged, and drowned in wine,
The monster dropped his lolling neck, and lay
Along the cave, disgorging as he slept
Man’s blood, and morsels mixed with gory wine,
We, the lots drawn, and the great powers implored.
Surge round him in one flood on every side,
And with a whetted brand bore out his eye.
Monstrous, his sole beneath the scowling brow,
Like Argive shield or lamp of Phoebus, glad
Thus to avenge at length our comrades’ shades. 638
But fly, ye hapless, fly, rend rope from shore:
For such, so vast, as Polyphemus here
Penning in hollow cave his fleecy flocks.
Or wringing dry their udders, a hundred more
House them at large along this winding coast,
Fell Cyclops-crew, and roam the mountain-tops.
Thrice hath the moon now filled her horns with light,
While with the beasts, in the lone forest-lairs
They haunt, I drag my life on, from the rock
Peering the vast Cyclopes to behold,
Or trembling at their voices and their tread. 648

## THE AENEID III

Berries and stony cornels from the boughs
And uptorn herb-roots yield me sorry fare.
All quarters scanning I at last beheld
This fleet of yours stand shoreward, and to this,
Prove what it might, consigned me: ’tis enough
To have escaped the monster-brood: do ye
Rather, by any death, cut short my days.’

‘Scarce had he spoke, when on the mountain-top
Himself, in mighty bulk among his flocks
Moving, and making for the well-known shore,
The shepherd Polyphemus we descry—
Monster fell, shapeless, vast, of eyesight reft. 657
Lopped by his hand a pine tree guides his steps
And steadies; his woolly sheep beside him stray,
Sole pleasure, these, and solace of his ill.
Soon as he touched the deep waves, reached the main,
He laves therewith the flow of gore from out
His eyeless socket, and gnashing with his teeth
Groans, and through ocean now at midmost wades;
Nor wetted yet the flood his towering sides.
Trembling we speed our flight afar, take up—
Meed well deserved— our suppliant, silently
Cut loose the rope, and bending forward sweep
With emulous oars the ocean. He perceived.
And turned his steps toward the sound: but when
No power is his to reach us with his hand,
Nor skill to match the Ionian waves in chase,
A boundless roar he raises, that the sea
And all its billows trembled, and, far in,
Affrighted was the land of Italy,
And Aetna bellowed through his winding caves. 674
Thereat the race of Cyclops, from the woods
And lofty mountains startled, to the port
Rushes, and throngs the shore. We see them stand,
Each with vain-lowering eye, that brotherhood
Of Aetna, and with heads upborne to heaven,
Grim conclave: as on some tall mountain-top
When skyey oaks, or cone-hung cypresses—
Jove’s lofty forest, or Diana’s grove—
Stand clustering: us keen terror headlong goads,
Whithersoever to slack out the sheets,
And spread our canvas to the following breeze. 689
But Helenus’ late warning bids them not
’Twixt Scylla and Charybdis hold their course—
On this or that side but a step from death:
Backward to steer the purpose holds; when lo!

## THE AENEID III

The north wind from Pelorum’s narrow home
Is launched upon us: I am wafted by
Pantagias’ mouth of living rock, the bay
Of Megara, and low-lying Thapsus. Such
The shores he showed, unthridding all the track
Of his past wanderings— Achaemenides,
Ill-starred Ulysses’ comrade. 691

‘An isle lies
Stretched full in front of the Sicanian bay,
Wave-washed Plemmyrium, called by men of old
Ortygia. Hither, the tale runs, Alpheus,
River of Elis, worked his hidden way
Beneath the sea, now, issuing at thy mouth,
Blends, Arethusa, with Sicilian waves.
The mighty guardians of the spot, as bidden,
We worship; then the o’er-fertile soil I pass
Of marshy-banked Helorus. Hence we skirt
Pachynum’s lofty cliffs and jutting crags;
Far off shows Camarina, fate-ordained
To be molested never, and Gela’s fields,
And Gela, from its furious river named; 702
Thence towering Acragas displays afar
Her mighty walls, once breeder of brave steeds:
Thee too I leave behind me, with sails spread,
Palmy Selinus, and I thrid the shoals
Of Lilybaeum, with blind rocks beset.
Anon the harbour and the joyless shore
Of Drepanum receives me. Here alas!
So many ocean-storms o’er-blown, I lose—
Lightener of every chance and every care—
My sire Anchises. Best of fathers, here
Thou leav’st me to my weariness, alas!
Snatched from those mighty perils all in vain. 711
Nor did the prophet, Helenus, ’mid all
His fearful bodings, of this grief foretell.
Nor dire Celaeno. My last trouble this,
And this the goal of my long voyaging.
Departing hence, heaven drave me to your shores.’

Thus Prince Aeneas, ’mid the hush of all,
Alone rehearsed the destinies of heaven,
And taught them of his wanderings, then at length
Ceased, made an end of speaking, and was still. 718

## BOOK IV

But stricken long since with anguish deep, the queen
Feeds at her veins the wounds, whose hidden fire
Consumes her. To her heart comes surging back
Full oft the manhood of the man, full oft
The lustre of his line: his looks, his words,
Cling rooted fast within her bosom's core,
And anguish to her frame calm sleep denies.
Now, with the torch of Phoebus, next day's dawn
Was traversing the world, and had from heaven
The dewy shade dispelled, when, ill at ease,
Thus, heart to heart, her sister she bespeaks:

> ‘Anna, my sister, say what dreams are these
> Perplex me and affright? What wondrous guest
> Hath entered 'neath our portals? what a mien
> He bears! what strength of breast and shoulder! I
> Deem him— no idle fancy— sprung from gods:
> Fear proves the base-born spirit. Ah me! what shocks
> Of fate he sang, what draughts of battle drained!
> Were not my heart's resolve set firm and fast,
> With none to yoke in wedlock-bands, since he,
> My first love, tricked me and betrayed by death—
> Irked me not bridal torch and bridal bed—
> To this one weakness I perchance had stooped.
> Anna, for I will own it, since the doom
> Of my poor lord Sychaeus, and the hearth
> Stained by a brother's blood-guilt, only he
> Hath swayed my sense, my tottering heart o'erthrown.
> Traces of that old flame I recognize:
> But first I would that earth yawn deep for me
> Or that the Sire Almighty with his bolt
> May to the shades, pale shades of Erebus
> And night abysmal, hurl me, before thee,
> O Shame, I outrage, or thy laws relax.
> He, who first joined me to himself, hath borne
> My heart away with him; his only be it
> To hold and guard within the grave.’ So saying,
Her bosom filled she with o’er-brimming tears.

> ‘O dearer to thy sister than the light,’

## THE AENEID IV

Anna replies, ‘wilt thou, till youth be done,
Still waste in lonely widowhood, nor e’er
The joy of children or love’s guerdon know?
Think’st this to dust and buried shades a care?
Albeit I trow no suitors heretofore
Swayed thy sick heart,— no, nor in Libya’s land,
Nor erst in Tyre— Iarbas thus was scorned,
And other lords to boot, whom Afric land
Rich in war’s triumph rears— wilt brave no less
A love that likes thee? dost not call to mind
Within whose borders thou art planted? here
Gaetulian cities hem thee in, a race
In war untamable, and therewithal
Numidia’s reinless riders, and the shoals
Of barbarous Syrtis: yonder lies a tract
Barren with drought, and the wide-raging sons
Of Barce. Wherefore tell of war’s alarms
Rising from Tyre, and thine own brother’s threats? 44
With gods to guide, methinks, and Juno’s aid,
This man sailed hither in his Ilian keels.
Think what a city, sister, here thou’lt see,
Aye, what a realm, arise, so husbanded!
With Teucria’s arms beside her, to what pitch
Will soar the Punic glory! only thou
Sue grace of heaven, and, expiation made,
Be lavish of good cheer, and interweave
Fresh pleas for tarriance, while on sea the storm
Still blusters, and Orion’s watery star,
’Mid shattered barks, and skies implacable.’ 53
So saying, she set the love ablaze,
Made bold the wavering mind, and banished shame.
First they approach the shrines, and pardon seek
Amid the altars, duly-chosen ewes
To Ceres, lawgiver, and Phoebus, slaying,
And sire Lyaeus— Juno before all,
Mistress of wedlock-bands. Dido herself
In peerless beauty, with her right hand grasps
A cup, and pours it full betwixt the horns
Of a white gleaming heifer, or moves on
Majestic, in the presence of the gods,
To the rich altars, and with sacrifice
Inaugurates the day, then, all agape,
Peering into the victims’ cloven breasts,
Consults the quivering entrails. Ah! how blind
The eyes of seers! love-frenzied, what can vows
Or shrines avail her? Ever the flame eats

## THE AENEID IV

Her tender heartstrings, and the wound is there
Silent, yet quick within her bosom’s core. 67
So, all on fire, unhappy Dido roams
Raging throughout the city, as some hind
Shaft-stricken, at unawares ’mid Cretan groves,
Which from far off a shepherd, with his darts
Chasing, hath pierced, and left the winged barb
Not knowing; through Dicte’s woody glades in flight
She scours, the death-reed sticking in her side.
Now through the city’s midst she with her leads
Aeneas, displaying her Sidonian wealth
And town built ready: she essays to speak,
And in mid-utterance stops; now, as day falls.
Seeking the selfsame board, poor fool! she asks
Once more to hear the tale of Ilium’s woe,
And hangs upon the speaker’s lips once more. 75
Then, when the guests have parted, when in turn
The low moon hides her radiance, and the stars
Sinking invite to sleep, in the void hall
With lonely grief, on his abandoned couch
She casts her, and, though sundered each from each,
Hears him and sees, or to her bosom clasps
Ascanius, ravished by his father’s look,
Her tyrant passion haply to beguile.
The half-reared turrets rise not, the youth ply
No martial exercise, nor harbours build,
Nor bastions for defence in war; the works
Break off suspended, the high-threatening bulk
Of walls, and engines that uptower to heaven. 89
Her when the well-loved spouse of Jove beheld
By such a plague possessed, and her good name
No bar to madness, thus to Venus then
Spake Saturn’s daughter: ‘Peerless is the praise,
Ample the booty ye bear off, I wot,
Thou and thy boy, a great and famous name—
One woman by two gods o'ermatched with guile!
Me, soothly, it escapes not that thou fear’st
These walls of ours, tall Carthage and her homes
Eyeing askance; but what shall be the end?
Or whereto serves this mighty conflict now? 98
Why rather work we not a lasting peace,
And plighted spousal-troth? that, thy whole heart
Desired, thou hast. Dido with love ablaze,
And through her frame the tide of frenzy spreads.
Rule we as one then, and with equal powers,
This people; let her own a Phrygian lord,

## THE AENEID IV

And yield her Tyrians to thy hand as dower.’
Perceiving that in guile of heart she spake,
To shift Rome’s empire to the Libyan shore,
Venus in turn addressed her: ‘Who so fond
As to reject such offers, or make choice
With thee to strive for mastery, so success
Wait on thy word's accomplishment? but I
Drift doubtful of the fates, if Jupiter

# Aeneid (Part 6 of 21)

## Book IV

To Tyrian folk and travellers from Troy
Wills but one city, or would have them blent
Nation with nation, or firm league be joined. 112
Thou art his wife; for thee ’tis meet to probe
His heart with supplication; do thou lead,
I follow.” Then royal Juno took the word:
“Leave me that task; now, mark, I’ll briefly show
How the main purpose may be compassed.
Aeneas, unhappy Dido at his side,
Goes forth to hunt amid the forest, when
Titan to-morrow’s dawn shall first display,
And with his beams lay bare the world; then I,
While huntsmen hurry, and hem the wood with snares,
Will a black storm of mingled hail and rain
Pour down, with thunder the whole welkin wake. 122
Far will their train be sundered, by thick gloom
Enveloped; Dido and the Trojan prince
To the same cave shall come. I will be there
To knit the twain, so stead me thy goodwill,
In wedlock sure and seal her for his own.
Such shall their spousal be.” To her request
She of Cythera nodded, nothing loth,
And laughed at revelation of the guile.
Meanwhile Aurora rising left the sea.
With dayspring from the gates a chosen band
Go forth; mesh-woven toils, nets, hunting-spears
Broad-tipped with iron, Massylian horsemen too,
Speed onward, and the dogs’ keen-scented might. 132
The queen still loiters in her bower, the while
Her Punic lords beside the portal wait;
See, housed in gold and purple her steed stands,
And fiercely champs the foaming bit. At length,
Thronged with a mighty concourse, forth she comes,
Clad in Sidonian scarf with broidered hem—
Gold quiver, and locks up-knotted into gold,
Gold too the brooch that clasps her purple robe!
Here ’mid the Phrygian train Iulus rides 142

Exulting. Comelier than all else himself
Aeneas moves to meet them, joins the troop.
As when Apollo quits his winter-home,
Lycia, and Xanthus’ floods, his mother’s isle
Delos to visit, and renews the dance,
While round the altar in a motley throng
Shout with one voice Cretans and Dryopes,
And painted Agathyrsi; he himself
Walks over Cynthus’ height, his flowing hair
Trimmed with a wreath’s soft pressure, twined with gold; 150
Clatter the shafts about his shoulders; so,
Nor tardier-limbed than he, Aeneas strode;
Such beauty from his peerless face outshone.
Now to the heights and pathless coverts come,
Mark, how the wild goats from the crag-top scared
Run down the ridges! yonder see the stags
Scour through the open in close-huddling herds,
Dust in their wake, and leave the hills behind. 159
But in the glen’s heart young Ascanius
Joys in his fiery steed, now these, now those
Out-galloping, and, 'mid the timorous game,
Prays heaven a foaming boar his vows may bless,
Or tawny lion from the height come down.
Meanwhile with mutterings loud a mighty broil
Begins in heaven: rain follows, mixed with hail.
The Tyrian train and Trojan youth pell-mell,
With Venus’ grandson, the Dardanian boy,
Dismayed, seek various shelter through the fields;
Streams from the hillside race. The Trojan prince
And Dido to the self-same cavern come. 172
Earth first, and bridal Juno, gave the sign;
Flashed at the nuptials fire and conscious air,
And shouted from their topmost peak the nymphs.
First day of death was that, first cause of ill;
Swayed nor by outward show, nor rumour’s tongue,
Dido of secret passion dreams no more:
Marriage she calls it—name to mask her fall.
Anon flies fame through Libya’s mighty towns,
Fame, whom no other evil can outrun;
Motion her might, strength gains she as she goes.
Small first through fear, soon mounts she up to heaven,
Plants foot on earth, and hides her head in cloud.
Her once, provoked to wrath against the gods,
Earth bare, the latest of her brood, they say,
Sister to Coeus and Enceladus,
Swift-footed, fleet-winged, monster dreadful, vast,
Who, for each plume her body bears, beneath
Hath watchful eyes as many, strange to tell,
As many tongues, as many sounding mouths,
Pricks ears as many: by night ’twixt earth and heaven
She cleaves the darkness, hissing as she flies,
Nor ever droops her eyelids in sweet sleep: 185
By day she sits perched like a sentinel,
Or on high roof-top, or on lofty tower,
And scares great cities, prone to grip as fast
False tales and baseless, as bear tidings true.
She now with manifold discourse had joy
Folks’ ears to fill, now fable and now fact
Rehearsing: that Aeneas has arrived,
Sprung from the blood of Troy, with whom for lord
Fair Dido deigns to wed: now, each with each,
They lap the livelong winter in soft ease,
Heedless of empire, by base love enthralled.
Such tidings the foul goddess far and wide
Scatters from mouth to mouth: then straightway bends
Her course to king Iarbas, and inflames
His heart with rumour, and heaps high his wrath. 197
He, sprung from Ammon and his ravished bride
A Garamantian nymph, to Jove had reared
Through his broad realms a hundred mighty fanes,
A hundred altars, and had hallowed there
Fire, the gods’ sleepless sentry, to keep watch
For ever, a floor fat with blood of beasts,
And portal with gay blossoms garlanded.
He, soul-distraught, fired with the bitter tale,
Is said, before the altars, and amidst
The majesties of heaven, to have implored
Jove fervently with suppliant hands upturned. 205
“Almighty Jove, to whom the Moorish race
On broidered couches feasting pour as now
The offering of the wine-god, seest thou this?
Or is’t for naught we dread thee, Sire, when thou
Hurlest thy thunderbolts, and do blind fires
Affright our spirit in the clouds, and brew
But empty rumblings? lo! a woman here,
Who wandering in our realm gat leave for gold
To found a paltry city, to whom we gave
Coastland to till, and laws of tenure— she
Hath our alliance spurned, and ta’en instead
Aeneas to lord, and partner of her throne.
And now that Paris, with his emasculate train,
Chin and oiled hair with Lydian headgear propped,
Enjoys the spoil: we to thy fanes, aye thine,
Bring gifts forsooth, and nurse an empty tale.” 217
As thus he prayed and clasped the altar, lo!
Him the Almighty heard, and turned his eyes
Towards the queen’s palace, and the lovers there
Of nobler fame forgetful. Thereupon
He thus addresses Mercury, and withal
On such an errand sends him: “Hie thee forth,
Invoke the Zephyrs, son, glide on the wing,
And to the Dardan chief who loiters now
In Tyrian Carthage, and regards no whit
His fate-assigned city, speak, bear safe
Through the swift winds my word. Not such the man
His beauteous mother to our hopes foretold,
Twice therefore rescued from the hosts of Greece,
But one to rule o’er Italy, a land
Teeming with empires, turbulent with war,
Hand on the race from Teucer’s blood derived,
And to law’s bidding make the whole world bow. 231
If by such high renown he be not fired,
Nor for his own fame brace him to the toil,
Yet to Ascanius can his sire begrudge
Rome’s ramparts? what designs he? with what aim
Lags amid folk unfriendly, nor regards
Ausonia’s race and the Lavinian fields?
Let him aboard! This is the sum in brief;
Hereof be thou my herald.” 237
He had said:
Anon the other made ready to obey
His mighty sire’s behest, and first he binds
About his feet the golden anklets, which
Wing-wafted bear him high o’er land and sea
Swift as the hurrying breeze, then grasps his wand,
Wherewith from Orcus the pale ghosts he bids,
Others to gloomy Tartarus sends below,
Gives or bereaves of slumber, and unseals
The eyes in death: on this relying, he drives
The winds along, and skims the weltering clouds.
Now ’mid his flight the crest and towering sides
He sees of stubborn Atlas, who bears heaven
Upon his peak, Atlas whose pine-clad head
Girt round about for ever with dark clouds,
By wind and rain is buffeted; shed snow
Mantles his shoulders, while from his hoar chin
Streams tumble, and an ice-beard bristles stiff. 257
Here, poised on level pinions, stayed him first
The god Cyllenian, to the waves from hence
Plunged with his whole frame headlong, like a bird
Which round the shores, round the fish-haunted rocks,
Flies low beside the sea-marge: thus he flew
’Twixt earth and heaven o’er Libya’s sandy shore,
And clove the winds, leaving his mother’s sire,
Cyllene’s nursling. Soon as his winged feet
Had gained the huts, Aeneas he discerns
Building new homes, and founding towers, and lo!
A sword he wore, with yellow jasper starred,
And from his shoulders hung a cloak that burned
With Tyrian purple, wealthy Dido’s gift,
Wrought by her hand, and tissued with fine gold. 264
Forthwith he thus assails him; “Art thou now
Of lofty Carthage the foundations laying,
And rearing a fair city, wife-enthralled?
Ah! lost to thine own kingdom and its cares!
From bright Olympus lo! the lord of heaven,
Who with his deity sways earth and sky,
Sends down, and through the swift breeze bids me bear
This message: What design’st thou? with what aim
Wastest in Libya’s land the idle hours?
If by such high renown thou be not stirred,
Nor for thine own fame brace thee to the toil,
Yet of Ascanius springing into man,
Thine heir Iulus, and his hopes, have heed,
To whom are owed the realm of Italy,
The land of Rome.” So saying, Cyllene’s god
Passed, while yet speaking, from the eyes of men,
And into thin air vanished out of sight. 279
But at the vision stunned and speechless stood
Aeneas: his hair with horror rose, the voice
Stuck in his throat: he burns to get him gone,
And quit the pleasant land, dazed by so dread
A warning, and the sovereign voice of heaven.
What can he do? Ah! with what words approach
The impassioned queen? what opening prelude try?
Hither and thither his swift mind he parts,
Speeds it all ways, and sweeps the round of thought,
Till, wavering long this counsel pleased him best. 287
Mnestheus, Sergestus, and Serestus bold
He summons all silently to trim the fleet,
Gather the crews on shore, and muster arms,
And of his altered purpose hide the cause.
Meanwhile, since gracious Dido knows not, nor
Looks for so strong a passion to be snapped,
He will try access, and what hour for speech
Most tender, and what fashion fits the need.
Right swiftly one and all his sovereign word
With joy obey, and do his bidding. 295

But
The queen— for who can lover’s heart beguile?—
Divined it, caught at once the coming change,
Fearful where all was safety. Fame again,
Fiendish as ever, in her maddened ear
Cries that the fleet is rigging, ripe for sea.
Bankrupt at heart she rages, and on fire
Through all the city, like some Maenad, storms,
Roused by the shaken emblems, when with shout
Of Bacchus the triennial orgies goad,
And loud Cithaeron summons her by night. 303
Then she took up the word, and thus bespake
Aeneas: “False heart, didst even think to hide
So foul a wrong, and from my land depart
In silence? Can our love, and hand once joined
In hand, not hold thee, nor the cruel death
In store for Dido? Nay, beneath the sky
Of winter even dost thou fit out thy fleet,
And ’mid the north wind’s blustering haste to go,
O heartless, over-sea? Why, wert thou not
Bound for strange fields and unknown homes, and were
Troy, as of old, still standing, would’st thou steer
Even for Troy across yon billowy deep?
Is it from me thou fliest? By these tears,
By thy right hand, since naught beside, alas
Myself have left me, by our love’s embrace,
And marriage-rites begun, if ever I
Did thee fair service, or if aught I am
Was dear to thee, pity a falling house,
And, if prayers yet have place, I thee conjure,
Cast the thought from thee. For thy sake the tribes
Of Libya hate me, and the nomad chiefs,
And Tyrians turn to foes: for thy sake, too,
Quenched is my honour and good name of old,
By which alone I had access to heaven. 313
To whom dost thou abandon me to die,
O guest, since even to this has shrunk the name
Of husband? Wherefore do I linger on?
Is’t that Pygmalion, my brother, may
Pull down, the while, my battlements, or me
Gaetulian Iarbas make his thrall? 326
If only, if before thy flight, my arms
Had clasped a child of thine, if in my hall
Some tiny-limbed Aeneas played, to bring
Thee back at least in feature, I had then
Not seemed so wholly captive and forlorn.”
She had said: the other by command of Jove
Kept his eyes fixed, and struggling deep at heart
To smother down the anguish, thus at length
Returns brief answer: “Naught that thou canst plead
Of all thy countless benefits, O queen,
Shall e’er by me be gainsaid, nor shall I
Tire of Elissa’s memory, while of self
Still mindful, while the life-breath guides my limbs.
Brief be my words to meet the need: I ne’er
Took thought— suppose it not— to veil my flight
In secrecy, nor e’er before thee held
The bridegroom’s torch, or to such compact came. 339
Had fate vouchsafed me at mine own free will
Life's course to shape, and, as my own heart prompts,
Make truce with trouble, my first fond care had been
Troy’s city, and the dear ashes of my friends;
Priam’s tall roof were standing, and this hand
Had, for her vanquished children, from the dust
Requickened Pergamus. But Apollo now,
The lord of Grynium, to great Italy,
To Italy the Lycian oracles,
Bid me repair: this is my love, and this
My country. If, Phoenician as thou art,
The towers of Carthage and a Libyan town
Hold thine eyes gazing, wherefore grudge, I ask,
To Teucrian settlers an Ausonian home?
We too may quest for outland kingdoms: me,
Oft as the night with dewy shade enfolds
The world, oft as the starry fires arise,
My sire Anchises’ spirit warns in sleep,
And with its troubled look affrights, me too
The thought of young Ascanius, and the wrong
To that dear head, from whom my fault withholds
Hesperia’s empire and predestined fields. 355
Now too the interpreter of heaven, by Jove
Himself sent down— thy head and mine I call
To witness— through the flying air has brought
A mandate: I myself beheld the god
Entering the city in clear light of day,
And with these ears drank in his accents. Cease
With thy complaints to fire thy soul and mine;
Not self-impelled steer I for Italy.”
On him, thus speaking, she was all the while
Glaring askance, and rolling to and fro
Her eyes, surveying with their silent looks
The whole man through, then thus blazed out in words: 367
“No goddess was thy mother, nor Dardanus,
False man, the founder of thy line, but thee
Jagged with hard rocks, Caucasus begat,
And to thy lips Hyrcanian tigresses
Their udders set, since why the truth disguise?
For what worse ills restrain me? Did he moan
Over my weeping? did he bend his eyes,
Pay toll of tears, show pity for his love?
What first, what next to say? Now, now no more
Juno, great queen, nor the Saturnian Sire
Looks on these things with equal eyes. Nowhere
Can faith be trusted. Cast upon my shore
A beggar, I welcomed him, and, mad the while,
Set on my throne to share it; his lost fleet,
His crews, from death I rescued. Ah! the fires
Of frenzy toss me! Now Apollo too
Soothsayer, now the Lycian oracles,
Yea, the god’s mouthpiece, sent by Jove himself,
Now through the breezes his grim bidding bears. 379
Such doubtless is the task of gods above,
Such care disturbs their rest. I keep thee not,
Nor would rebut thy words; go, with the winds
Chase Italy, seek realms beyond the wave.
I hope indeed that on the mid-sea rocks,
If aught the good powers can, thy lips will drain
The cup of suffering, and oft cry aloud
On Dido’s name: with murky firebrands I
Will follow thee, though far, and, when cold death
Has severed soul and limbs, in every place
My shade shall haunt thee. O graceless, thou shalt rue it,
And I shall hear thereof, yea, for the tale
Will reach me, even among the nether dead.” 397
So saying, her speech broke off; she, sick at heart,
Flies from the light, and, turning from his glance,
Flings forth and leaves him with tear-palsied tongue,
Though words throng thick for utterance. Her the slaves
Uplift, and to a marble chamber bear,
And lay her fainting limbs upon the bed.
But good Aeneas, though he yearns to assuage
And soothe the sufferer, with his words ward off
Her sorrow, deeply groaning and with heart
That tottered ’neath the bulk of love, nathless
Obeys heaven’s bidding, to his fleet repairs. 396
Then fall the Teucrians to the work, and all
Along the shore drag down their lofty ships:
The pitched keel floats, and leafy oars they bring,
And timber from the woods unwrought, for flight
So eager: you may mark them on the move,
At every outlet hurrying from the town!
As when ants plunder a huge heap of corn,
Of winter ware, and house it in their store;
Moves a black column o’er the plain, the spoil
In narrow path along the grass convoying;
Some set their shoulders to the ponderous grains,
And push them, some drive up the rearward ranks,
Chiding delay; the whole track seethes with toil. 407
At such a sight what feelings then were thine,
Dido, or what groans uttered’st, to behold
From lofty tower the wide beach boil with men,
And the whole sea beneath thy gazing eyes
Maddened with their loud shouting? Tyrant love,
To what dost thou not drive the hearts of men?
To tears once more must she betake her now,
Once more with prayer assail him, and bow down
Her pride, a suppliant at the throne of love,
Lest she die vainly, leaving aught untried. 415
“Anna, this hurrying over the whole shore
Thou seest; from all sides they are met; the sail
Now courts the breeze, the seamen in their joy
Have crowned the sterns with flowers. If strength was mine
Such grief to anticipate, I shall no less
Have strength to bear it, sister. This one boon,
Anna, nathless perform for wretched me.
For thee alone yon traitor made his friend,
To thee would e’en his secret moods confide;
Thou only knewest the tender ways and hours
Of access to the man: go, sister mine,
And suppliant-wise entreat our haughty foe:
I never with the Danaan host conspired
At Aulis to cut off the race of Troy,
Nor sent a fleet to Pergamus, nor uptore
His sire Anchises’ buried dust or shade,
That to those obdurate ears he should debar
My words from entrance. Whither hastes he so?
This last boon let him grant his hapless love,
And wait for a kind voyage and carrying winds.
For our old marriage-bond, by him betrayed,
I ask no more, no, nor that he should lack
Fair Latium, or resign his realm; I seek
An empty hour of time, respite and room
For madness to have play, till fortune tame
And school me unto grief. ’Tis the last grace
I ask— pity thy sister; grant but this,
In death I will requite it o’er and o’er.”
Such was her prayer, and such the tearful tale,
Her dolorous sister bears and bears again.
But by no tearful tale will he be swayed,
Nor any words heed, to be bent thereby;
Fate hinders, heaven shuts fast his willing ears.
Even as a sturdy and time-timbered oak,
Which Alpine north winds with their fitful blasts
Strive emulous to o’ertopple; loud it creaks,
The stem rocks, and the leaves strew deep the ground;
Itself clings to the crag, and, howso’ far
The summit soars toward the airs of heaven,
So deep strikes root into the vaults of hell.
E’en thus, with ceaseless, ever-shifting cries
The hero’s heart is buffeted; he feels
The deep grief through his mighty bosom thrill;
The mind stands firm, and tears are showered in vain.
Then ill-starred Dido by her fate dismayed
Cries upon death: it irks her to behold
The arch of heaven. The more to goad her on
Her purpose to fulfil, and quit the light,
She saw— fearful to tell!— while offering gifts
Upon the incense-kindled altars— saw
The sacred juice darken, the outpoured wine
To loathsome gore transmuted: but to none,
Not even her sister, spake she of the sight.
Moreover in the palace was a shrine
Of marble to her former lord, which she
With wondrous honour tended, wreathed about
With snow-white fleeces and with festal boughs. 459
Hence fell upon her ears accents and words
As of her husband calling her, when night
Held the world darkling, and the owl alone
On roof-top uttered with funereal note,
Moan upon moan, her long-drawn wailing cry;
And many a presage of the seers of old
With omen dire affrights her. Then in sleep
Aeneas himself all fiercely goads her on
To frenzy; and ever being left alone
She seems, and evermore companionless
Pacing a weary journey, while she seeks
Her Tyrians in a land untenanted: 468
As maddened Pentheus sees the Furies' troop,
A double sun, a twofold Thebes appear,
Or, on the stage, as Agamemnon’s child,
Orestes, hunted, flies his mother armed
With firebrands and black serpents—at the door,
Vassals of vengeance, the grim sisters sit.
So when, by grief o’erpowered, she had conceived
The frenzy, and resolved to die, alone
She weighs with her own heart the hour, the means,
And her sad sister thus bespeaks, with face
That masks her purpose, and hope-brightened brow: 477
“Child of my sire, I have found out a way—
Give thou thy sister joy— to win him back,
Or loose me from his love. Near ocean’s bound
And sunset is the far-off Aethiop land,
Where mightiest Atlas on his shoulder turns
The pole, with fiery stars bestudded: thence
Was shown me a priestess of Massylian race,
And temple-warder of the Hesperides,
Who erst with dainties to the dragon given
Kept safe the sacred boughs upon the tree,
Sprinkling moist honey and slumberous poppy-seed. 486
She with her spells takes on her to unbind
What hearts she will, on others launch shrewd pangs,
Stop rivers in their flow, turn back the stars:
She summons ghosts at midnight; thou shalt see
Earth bellowing ’neath thy feet, and from the heights
Ash-trees descending. But I call the gods,
Thee, sister dear, and thy beloved head,
To witness, that unwillingly I gird
The magic arts upon me. Do thou rear
In the inner court, all secretly, a pyre
To heaven, and let the hero’s arms, which he,
Godless, left hanging in the chamber, all
His empty raiment, and the bridal bed,
That was my bane— let these be piled above:
To wipe out every record of the wretch,
Such is my pleasure, and thus the priestess bids.” 498
So spake she, and was silent; pallor then
O’er-spreads her features. Anna none the less
Thinks not her sister by these novel rites
Weaves but a cloak for death, nor can her heart
Conceive such frenzy, nor aught worse she fears
Than when Sychaeus died: so sets about
Her errand.

But the queen, when now the pyre
Rose huge to heaven amid her hall’s recess,
Of pine and cloven ilex, hangs the place
With garlands, and festoons with funeral boughs.
High over all upon the couch she lays
His empty raiment, and the sword he left,
Aye, and his image, knowing what should come. 508
Altars stand round, and with dishevelled hair
The priestess thunders forth three hundred gods,
Erebus, Chaos, and triple Hecate—
Three-visaged maid Diana. Water too
She had sprinkled, from Avernus’ fountain feigned;
And downy herbs with brazen sickles shorn
By moonlight, milky with black bane, are sought,
Sought too a love-charm torn from brow of colt,
Newborn, ere dam could snatch it. She herself
With salt cake and pure hands, the altar nigh,
One foot unsandalled, and with garb ungirt,
Calls on the gods, and stars that wot of doom,
Or ere she die; aye, and if any powers
Righteous and unforgetful have in charge
Lovers ill-mated, unto these she prays. 521
’Twas night, and weary limbs o’er all the earth
Quaffed quiet slumber; forest and wild waves
Had sunk to rest; when stars with gliding orbs
Wheel midway, and when all the field is still,
Cattle, and painted birds, that haunt the breadth
Of limpid lakes, or the rough bosky wold—
Beneath night’s silence laid to sleep, their cares
Awhile were lulled, their hearts forgot to ache.
Not so the spirit-vexed Phoenician queen,
Nor ever does she sink dissolved in sleep,
Nor draw the night into her heart or eyes:
Her pangs redouble, and raging love once more
Surges and swells with the high tide of wrath. 532
Thus then begins she, thus with her own heart
Revolves: “Lo! what have I to do? once more
Make trial of former suitors to my scorn?
Beg on my knees with nomad lords to mate,
Whose proffered nuptials I have spurned so oft?
Well, shall I follow, therefore, Ilium’s fleet,
The Teucrians’ utmost bidding? Because they
Are fain of my past succour, and the grace
Of former kindness in their hearts lives on?
Nay, if I would, who’ll suffer me, or take
The hated woman to their haughty ships?
Ah! lost one, know’st not, nor perceivest yet
The perjured race of false Laomedon? 542
What then? in lonely flight shall I attend
The triumph of their seamen? or, girt round
With Tyrians and the host of all my friends,
Rush forth, and these, from their Sidonian town
Whom hardly I uptore, drive back to sea,
And bid spread canvas to the gale? Nay, die
As thou deserv’st; end sorrow with the sword.
Thou, sister, vanquished by my tears, thou first
Didst load my frantic spirit with these ills,
And thrust me on the foe. Why could I not,
Like a wild creature, free from wedlock, live
Blameless, and meddle not with woes like these?
Broken is my honour, and ill-kept the faith
Vowed to the ashes of Sychaeus!” Such
Bitter complaints kept bursting from her heart.
On the high stern Aeneas, fixed to go,
His gear in order trim, now slumbering lay,
When the god’s phantom with the self-same face
Returning, brake upon his sleep, and thus
Seemed to admonish him once more, in all
Like unto Mercury, both voice and hue,
And yellow locks, and youthful grace of limb:
“O goddess-born, at such a time canst thou
Sleep on? what perils compass thee about
Perceiv’st not, madman, nor canst hear the breath
Of favouring Zephyrs? In her bosom she
Craft and dire crime revolving, fixed on death,
Lashes to storm the fitful tides of wrath. 564
Why fliest not headlong hence, while headlong flight
Is in thy power? Anon the main thou’lt see
Crowded with craft, and with fierce brands aglow,
Anon the shore one fiery blaze, if dawn
Still find thee on these shores a loiterer. Up!
Break off delay! a shifting, changeful thing
Was woman ever.” So he spake, and passed
Into the blackness of the night.

Forthwith
Aeneas, by the sudden phantom scared,
Upleaps from slumber, and plies hard his crew: 572
“Wake in hot haste, my friends, and man the thwarts;
Trim the sails quickly! sent from heaven on high,
A god, see! once again comes goading me
To speed our flight, and cut the twisted ropes.
Hail, holy among gods, we follow thee,
Whoe’er thou art, and once again obey
Thy bidding gladly. O be near with grace
To aid, and bring propitious stars in heaven.”
He spake, and from the scabbard plucked his sword
Flashing and cut the cable with bare blade.
All, in one moment, the same ardour seized;
They hale, they hurry; deserted stands the shore,
The deep lies hid beneath their galleys; see!
Straining they churn the foam, and sweep the blue. 583
Now with new ray young Dawn was sprinkling earth
Leaving Tithonus’ saffron couch. The queen.

## The Aeneid IV

When first from her high tower she saw the light
Whiten, and all the ships with sails arow
Stand out to sea, and shore and harbour void,

With ne'er an oarsman, thrice and four times o'er
Smote with her hand the lovely breast, and rent
The yellow locks: "O Jupiter," she cries,

"Shall he then go, my kingdom put to scorn,
This stranger? Will they not bring arms apace,
Pursue from all the city, and some tear loose
The ships from dock? Away with speed, fetch fire.
Deal weapons out, ply oars!—what do I say?
Where am I? Or what madness warps my wit?
Unhappy Dido! Do thine impious deeds
Now touch thee home? It had been seemlier then
When thou wast offering him thy sceptre. Lo!
His hand and word of honour, who, they say,
Carries his country's home-gods where he goes,
And bowed the shoulder to his age-worn sire!
Ah! Might I not have seized and rent his limbs,
Cast them piecemeal upon the wave, cut down
His friends—his own Ascanius—and served up
The son for banquet at his father's board?
But doubtful would have proved the chance of war;
Be it so: whom had I to fear, death-doomed?
I to their camp should have borne firebrands, filled
Their decks with flame, and, child and sire and race
Wiped out together, myself have crowned the pile.
O Sun, that with thy torch encompassest
All earthly deeds, and Juno, messenger
And witness of my woes, and Hecate,
Name in the city crossways yelled by night,
And dread avenging sisterhood, and gods
Of dying Elissa, heed ye this, and turn
Your power to ills that earn it, and give ear
Unto my prayers. If that accursed life
Must reach the harbour, and float safe to shore,
If thus Jove's doom require, here stand the goal,
Yet by the sword of a brave race beset,
Outcast from home, and from Iulus' arms
Torn, let him sue for succour, and behold
His friends slain miserably, and when to terms
Of wrongful peace he yields him, let him not
His kingdom or the pleasant light enjoy,
But in the bare mid-plain, before his hour,
Fall and unburied lie. For this I pray,
And this last utterance with my life-blood pour.
And ye, O Tyrians, the whole stock and race
Dog with your hate for ever; to my dust
This boon bequeath ye. Let there be no love,
No league between the nations. O arise,
Unknown avenger, from my tomb, to chase
With fire and sword the Dardan settlers, now,
Hereafter, whensoe'er the strength is given.
Betwixt them, shore with shore, billow with wave,
And host with host, I call down enmity;
Be they themselves, and their sons' sons at war!"
So saying, on every side she turned her thought,
Seeking how soonest to break off the life
She loathed, then briefly unto Barce spake,
Nurse of Sychaeus, for the grave's black dust
In the old country held her own: "Dear nurse,
Fetch me my sister hither, bid her haste
With water from the stream her limbs to lave,
And beasts, and expiating rites prescribed
Bring with her, and so come; and thou thyself
With a pure fillet veil thy brows. My mind
Is bent this sacrifice to Stygian Jove,
Which duly I have ordered and begun,
To consummate, and put an end to grief,
And give to flame the Dardan's funeral pyre."
She spake: the other with an old wife's zeal
Hurried her footstep. But, in trembling haste
And fierce with her wild purpose, Dido now,
Rolling a bloodshot eye, her quivering cheeks
Flecked with bright spots, and blanched with coming death,
Bursts through to the inner court, and madly mounts
The death-pyre, and unsheathes the Dardan's sword—
Boon never asked for such a need as this.
Here, when the Trojan garments she beheld,
And the familiar bed, a little while
Pausing for tears and thought, she cast herself
Upon the couch, and spake her latest words:
"Relics once dear, while fate and heaven allowed,
Take this my spirit, and loose me from these woes.
My life is lived; the course by fortune given
I have fulfilled, and now the shade of me
Passes majestic to the world below.
I have built a noble city, mine own walls
Beheld, avenged my husband, and therewith
Wreaked on my brother the reward of hate;
Happy, ah! all too happy, if only—if
The Dardan keels had never touched our shore!"
She spake, and burying in the couch her face:
"I shall die unavenged, but let me die,"
She said: "Thus, thus with joy I take the road
To darkness. Let the cruel Dardan's eyes
Drink in the conflagration from the deep,
And my death-tokens haunt him on his way."
She had said; and, in the midst of words like these
Her folk beheld her sunk upon the sword,
And the blade reeking, and blood-dabbled hands.
Shrieks to the roof-top rise. Fame revels high
Through the stunned city. With laments and groans
And women's wail the palace rings, the sky
Resounds with their loud mourning. Even as if
With in-poured foes, all Carthage or old Tyre
Fell headlong, while the flames roll fiercely on
O'er towers of men and temples of the gods.
Half-dead to hear, and scared at breathless speed
With nail-torn features and fist-smitten breast,
Darts through the midst her sister, and calls loud
The dying one by name, "Was it then this,
Child of my sire?—wouldst thou put fraud on me?—
This that yon pyre, these flames and altars meant?
What shall I weep for first, left desolate!
Dying; didst spurn to have thy sister near?
Thou shouldst have bid me share thy doom, the same
Sword-pang, the self-same hour had found us both.
Nay, did I rear it with these hands, and call
Loud on our father's gods, ah! cruel, to be
Far off, and thou laid here? Thou hast destroyed,
Sister, thyself and me, the folk and sires
Of Sidon, and thy city. Let me lave
Her wounds with water, the last hovering breath
Catch haply on my lips." As thus she spake,
The lofty steps surmounted, she had clasped
Her dying sister to her bosom's warmth
With groans, the dark blood stanching with her robe.
She, fain to lift her heavy eyes, sinks back
Swooning; the sword grides fixed within her breast.
Thrice, struggling, she uprose on elbow propped,
And thrice rolled backward on the couch, and sought
Light in the vault of heaven, with wandering eyes,
And, finding, groaned. Almighty Juno then,
Pitying her long pain, and hard-fought-for death,
Sent Iris from Olympus down to loose
Her struggling spirit and writhen limbs; for since
Neither by fate, nor as the wage of sin,
She dying lay, but woe-struck, ere her hour,
And fired with sudden frenzy, Proserpine
Not yet had reft her of the yellow lock,
Nor to the Stygian Orcus doomed her head.
So Iris, on her saffron wings through heaven,
Glides dewy down, trailing a thousand tints,
That shift against the sun, and, o'er her head
Standing: "This offering unto Dis I bear,
As bidden, and from thy body set thee free."
So spake she, and with right hand sheared the lock:
At once the warmth ebbed wholly, and therewith
Her life into the breezes sped away.

## Book V

Meanwhile Aeneas upon the mid sea-way
Held steadfast with his fleet, and cut through waves
That scowled beneath the north wind, glancing oft
Back to the city-walls, now all aglow
With poor Elissa's funeral-flames. What cause
Has lit so fierce a fire, is hid from sight;
But outraged love's fierce anguish, and the thought
Of what a frantic woman can, lead on
The Teucrians' hearts to presages of woe.
Soon as their galleys gained the open deep,
And now no longer land appeared, but lo!
Ocean on all sides, and on all sides heaven,
There stood a dark-blue storm-cloud o'er his head,
Laden with night and tempest, and the wave
Shuddered beneath the gloom. From the high poop
The very helmsman, Palinurus, cries:
"Alas! Why have such clouds encircled heaven?
What next, O Father Neptune?" Having said,
Straightway he bids them trim the rigging taut,
And bend to their stout oars, and to the wind
Slants sail, and speaks: "High-souled Aeneas, even
Though Jupiter should pledge me on his word,
No hope were in me to fetch Italy
In such a sky. The winds veer round, and roar
Athwart, upgathering from the murky west,
And all the air is thickening into cloud.
Make head against it, or strive hard enow
We cannot. Since fortune betters us, be ours
To follow, and at her bidding shape our way.
Nor far thy brother Eryx' friendly shores
And ports Sicanian deem I, if the stars,
Erst noted, with due memory I retrace."
Then answered good Aeneas: "For my part I
Have long since seen the winds will have it so,
And that all vainly thou withstandst them: turn
The vessels' course. Could there be any land
To me more welcome, or where gladlier I
Would beach the weary ships, than that which holds
My Dardan friend, Acestes, and laps round
In its embrace my sire Anchises' dust?"
This said, they make for harbour; and the gales,
Now favouring, stretch the canvas; swiftly rides
Their fleet upon the flood; and glad of heart
At length they steer into the well-known shore.
But from a high far hill-top, marvelling
At their arrival, and the friendly barks,
Acestes speeds to meet them, bristling o'er
With javelins and a Libyan she-bear's fell.
Him to the river-god Crimisus erst
A Trojan mother bare; nor heedless now
Of his old lineage, their return he greets,
Gives them glad welcome of his rustic wealth,
And soothes their weariness with friendly cheer.
When the next day-beam in the utmost east
Had put the stars to rout, from the whole shore
Aeneas calls a gathering of his friends,
And from a mounded hillock speaks: "Great sons
Of Dardanus, from heaven's high race derived,
A year's course, with its months accomplished, now
Is rounding to a close, since we in earth
My divine father's bones and relics hid,
And mourning altars consecrated. Now,
Or I misdeem, the day is here, which I
Shall ever hold—for so ye gods have willed—
Sacred to grief and honour without end.
This, were I passing 'mid Gaetulian shoals
An outcast, aye, or ta'en at unawares
In Argive waters, or Mycenae's town,
Still had I quit my yearly vows, and pomp
Of solemn ordinance, and with their gifts
Heaped high the altars. Now, beyond all hope,
Not undesigned nor all unwillled of heaven,
I take it, by my sire's own dust and bones
We stand, safe-wafted to the friendly port.
Up, then, and all glad homage let us pay!
Sue we for winds, and may he grant that I
May build a city, and offer year by year
These rites in temples hallowed to his name!
Two head of steers Acestes, sprung from Troy,
Gives every ship by tale: bid to the feast
The hearth-gods, not your sires' alone, but those
Our host Acestes worships. Furthermore,
If the ninth dawn bring kindly day to men,
And with her beams disclose the world, I then
Will contests for the Phrygian folk ordain:
First of the swift fleet; then—whoe'er excels
In speed of foot, or, dauntless in his strength,
Steps forth, a champion in the javelin-bout,
And light-winged arrows, or with raw-hide gloves
Bold to do battle—let them all appear,
And look for palms to be the victor's prize.
Now hush ye, all: with garlands bind the brow."
Thus spake he, and about his temples twined
His mother's myrtle. So does Helymus,
So, ripe of age, Acestes, so the lad
Ascanius, and the rest thereafter. He
Strode from the council to the tomb, thronged round
With many thousands, 'midst a mighty train.
Here, meet libation, on the ground he pours
Two goblets of pure wine, of fresh milk two,
Two of the blood of victims; and he flings
Bright flowers, and cries: "Hail, sacred sire, once more!
Hail, dust of him once rescued, but in vain,
And shade and spirit of my father! Not
With thee was it vouchsafed to seek the bounds
And destined fields of Italy, nor yet
Ausonian Tiber, whatsoe'er it be."
He spake, and ceased, when from the shrine's recess
A slippery serpent trailed seven monstrous coils,
Plied seven times, fold on fold, and quietly
Twined round the tomb, and o'er the altars slid,
Whose back with dark blue spots was pied, his scales
Lit with the gleam of dappled gold; as when
The cloud-bow flings a thousand shifting tints
In the sun's eye. Aeneas at the sight
Stood wonder-struck: at last, with lengthy train
Gliding among the bowls and polished cups,
It tasted of the viands, and once more,
All harmless, sought the shelter of the tomb,
Leaving the altars it had lipped. Hereat
He to his father all the more renews
The interrupted rites, doubtful the while
Or genius of the spot to deem it, or
His sire's attendant spirit: two young sheep
He duly slaughters, and as many swine,
As many black-backed heifers, and poured forth
The wine-bowl, and on great Anchises' shade
Called, and the ghost let loose from Acheron.
His friends withal, as each had substance, bring
Glad gifts, and heap the altars, and slay steers.
Others in turn set cauldrons on, and, stretched
Along the greensward, lay live coals beneath
The spits, and roast the flesh.

The expected day
Was come, the ninth dawn in a cloudless sky,
Drawn by the steeds of Phaethon: report
And great Acestes' name the neighbouring folk
Had summoned; in blithe groups they thronged the shore
To see the children of Aeneas, some too
Prepared to join the contest. Full in sight,
And midmost of the ring, are first disposed
The prizes, sacred tripods, and green wreaths,
And palms to crown the victors, arms, and robes
With purple dyed, and talent-weights of gold
And silver: and from a hillock in the midst
The trumpet's note proclaims the sports begun.
For the first contest, matched with heavy oars,
Enter four vessels picked from all the fleet.
Mnestheus with keen crew drives swift *Pristis* on—
Mnestheus-of-Italy to be, from whom
Takes name the race of Memmius: Gyas next
The huge *Chimaera's* mighty bulk, in mass
A city, which the Dardan youth propel
With triple sweep, a threefold tier of oars
Rising together: on the *Centaur's* might
Sergestus, whence the Sergian house is named,
Cloanthus upon dark blue *Scylla* rides,
From whom thy race, Cluentius of Rome.
Far seaward fronts the foaming shores a rock
Oft drowned and beaten by the billowy swell.
What time the wild north-westers hide the stars;
In calm it sleeps, reared on still waves, a plain,
And standing-ground to sunny seagulls dear.
Here a green ilex-goal Aeneas, as Prince,
Sets up for signal, that the crews might know
Whence to return and their long circuit bend.
Then lots they cast for places; and the chiefs
Themselves upon the poop shine forth afar,
Glorious in gold and purple; for the rest,
The crews are crowned with wreaths of poplar-spray,
And steeped in oil their naked shoulders shine.
They man the thwarts, arms stretched to oars, full stretch
Await the signal: drains each bounding heart
Quick-knocking fear, and the wild thirst for praise.
Then, when the shrill trump sounded, in a trice
All from their bounds leapt forward; a sea-shout
Strikes heaven; the floods foam, churned with indrawn arms.
Abreast they cleave the furrows; the whole main yawns
Convulsed with oars and triple-pointed beaks.
Not in such heady race the two-horsed cars,
Poured from the bounds, grip course and go, nor shake
Their billowy reins above such scouring teams
The drivers, hanging forward to the lash.
Then with applause of men, shouts, favouring cheers,
The whole grove rings: the pent shore rolls along,
And the hills, smitten, buffet back, the din.
Outspeeds the rest, and skims the forward wave,
'Mid crowd and tumult, Gyas: follows him
Cloanthus, lustier-oared, but the pine's weight
Retards him: next, and at like interval,
*Pristis* and *Centaur* strive for foremost place.
Now *Pristis* has it, and now the *Centaur* huge
Outstrips and overhauls her; and now both
Ride, beak and beak, together, and with long keel
Cleave the salt billows: by this they neared the rock,
And had the goal in grasp, when Gyas, now first,
And of the half-course victor, loudly hails
Menoetes, his ship's pilot: "Whither away
So far to starboard? Hither steer, hug shore;
Let the oar graze the larboard cliff, and leave
The deep for others!" He said; Menoetes still,
Fearing blind rocks, steers off toward open sea:
"Whither away so wide? Make for the rocks,
Menoetes!" Gyas shouts and calls again;
And, glancing back, Cloanthus he beholds,
Now hard astern, holding the nearer course.
'Twixt Gyas' vessel and the roaring rocks
He to the left skims inward, suddenly
Passes his leader, leaves the goal behind,
And gains the safe smooth water. Then indeed
Grief in the young man's frame blazed fierce and high,
Nor did his cheeks lack tears, and heedless both
Of his own honour and his comrades' lives,
Laggard Menoetes sheer from the high poop
Into the sea he flings: himself instead
The tiller takes, pilot and captain too,
Cheers on his men, and shoreward turns the helm.
But from the sea-floor scarce at length cast up,
Menoetes, heavy now with age, and soaked
In his wet garments, to the cliff-top climbed,
And on the dry rock sat. The Teucrian folk
Laughed at him falling, swimming, and laugh now
To see the salt waves from his chest disgorged.
Here the two last, Sergestus, Mnestheus, feel
Glad hope within them kindle to outstrip
The lagging Gyas. Sergestus gains the lead
And nears the crag, yet overlaps he not
A whole keel's length, but part alone, and part
The jealous *Pristis* presses with her beak.
Then, through his vessel striding, 'midst the crew,
Mnestheus exhorts them: "Rise to the oar, now, now,
Comrades of Hector, whom in Troy's last hour
I chose to be my fellows; now put forth
That strength, that spirit, which erst ye showed amidst
Gaetulian quicksands, on the Ionian Sea,
And Malea's chasing waves. No more seek I,
Mnestheus, the foremost place, nor strive to win;
Yet oh!—but let them conquer, to whom thou,
Neptune, hast granted it. Count we it shame
Last to arrive! Thus far, my countrymen,
Prevail ye, and ward off disgrace!" They bend
Forward, and strive their utmost: the brass poop
Quivers beneath their mighty strokes: the floor
Runs from beneath them: then thick panting shakes
Limbs and dry lips: the sweat flows out in streams.
A mere chance brought them the much-wished-for place;
For while Sergestus, mad at heart, drives close
In toward the rocks, and draws to dangerous ground,
Hapless, upon projecting reefs he stuck.
The cliffs were jarred; on a sharp crag the oars
Smote with a crash, and the prow struck and hung.
Up leap the crew loud-shouting, fast aground,
Bring iron-shod boat-hooks and sharp-pointed poles,
And from the billows pluck their broken oars.
Mnestheus exults, and, keener by success,
Scuds with swift oar-sweep, and a prayer to the winds,
Down the slope seas, and scours the open main.
As, from her cave roused suddenly, a dove,
Whose home and sweet brood lie in the crannied rock,
Flies fieldward borne, with clamorous pinion-clap
Scared from her cell; soon, gliding in calm air,
She skims the sky-way swift on moveless wing:
So Mnestheus, *Pristis* so, of her own will
Cleaves the last water, so mere speed of way
Carries her flying. And first he leaves behind
Sergestus, struggling on the lofty rock,
And in the shoals, calling in vain for aid,
And learning to make way with broken oars.
Then Gyas and his *Chimaera* vast of bulk
He overtakes: she yields, of helmsman reft.
And now, and close upon the goal, remains
Alone Cloanthus: him he makes for, him,
Striving with utmost strength, pursues. Ah! then
The shouts redouble; all goad him to the chase
With eager cheers: heaven echoes to their din.
These deem it shame, except they hold their own—
The glory they have won—would barter life
Itself for fame: those thrive upon success;
They can because they think they can; and so
Perchance even now they would have ta'en the prize,
Prow matched with prow, had not Cloanthus stretched
Clasped hands across the deep, and poured forth prayers,
Calling the gods to hear his vows. "Ye gods
That sway the main, over whose waves I run,
Gladly before your altars on this shore,
I, vow-beholden, will a white bull set,
Into the salt flood fling his entrails far,
And pour clear-flowing wine." He spake, and him
Under the deep waves all the Nereid-band
Heard, and the choir of Phorcus, and with them
The maiden Panopea; and himself
The sire Portunus with his mighty hand
Pushed him upon his way. To shore she flies
Swifter than south wind or a winged shaft,
And now lies sheltered in the haven's depth.
Then, duly summoning all, Anchises' son
Proclaims Cloanthus victor by loud voice
Of herald, and with green bay-leaf binds his brow;
And to the crews three bullocks of their choice
He gives, and wine, and a great talent-weight
Of silver, to bear off, and to the chiefs
Themselves adds special honours—for the first
A gold-wrought scarf, twice round whose borders ran
Broad Meliboean purple, in winding wave.
Therein embroidered is the royal boy
On leafy Ida, as he tires the stag
With javelin and the chase, keen, like to one
Panting, whom Jove's swift armour-bearer snatched
Aloft from Ida with crook'd talons: see!
His aged guardians stretch vain hands on high,
And the hounds' baying goes fiercely up to heaven.
But to the hero who gat second place
In prowess, a corslet linked with polished hooks
Of gold twilled triple, which his own victor hand
Had from Demoleos on swift Simois' bank
Torn beneath lofty Troy, he gives to bear,
A glory and defence in battle. It
Scarce could the churls Phegeus and Sagaris,
Shoulder to shoulder, heave with all its folds;
But clad in it of yore Demoleos drave
Full speed the flying Trojans. The third prize
He makes twin brazen cauldrons, and cups wrought
Of cunning silver, rough with tracery-work.
And now, thus dowered, and glorying in their gifts,
Brow-bound with purple fillets, all went forth.
When, from the cruel rock with much ado
'Scaped hardly, oars lost, crippled of one tier,
'Mid laughter urging his inglorious bark,
Sergestus came. As oft at unawares
A serpent, caught upon the heaped highway,
Which or a brazen wheel hath crossed aslant,
Or heavy-smiting traveller left half dead
And mangled with a stone, now trying to flee
Twists his long body into coils, in vain,
Part still defiant, and, with fiery eyes,
Rearing aloft the hissing throat; but part
Maimed by the wound retards him, as he wreaths
Joint upon joint, self-knotted and convolved:
So oared, the ship came slowly labouring on,
Yet she spreads sail, and, full sail, enters port.
Aeneas with promised boon Sergestus dowers,
Glad for ship saved and rescued crew: to him
Is given a slave, skilled in Minerva's craft,
The Cretan Pholoe, twin boys at her breast.
Then good Aeneas, the race dispatched, moves on
Into a grassy plain, by sloping hills
Girdled with forest; and amidst the vale
There was an amphitheatre, whereto
The prince with many thousands strode, and sat
On a high mound, the centre of the throng.
Here in fleet foot-race whoso list to strive
He lures with prizes, sets the guerdon forth.
Teucrians, Sicanians, mixed, front all sides flock:
See! Foremost Nisus and Euryalus!
Euryalus famed for beauty and fresh youth,
Nisus for the fair love he bore the boy.
Next followed, reared from Priam's noble stem,
Princely Diores: after him, together,
Salius and Patron, Acarnanian one,
One of Arcadia's blood, a Tegean born.
Then two Trinacrian comers, Helymus
And Panopes, to forest-life inured,
Comrades of old Acestes; many more
To boot, whom rumour doth in darkness hide.
Then in their midst Aeneas spake: "My words
Take now to heart, and lend me cheerful heed.
None of all here will I let giftless go.
Two Gnosian javelins bright with burnished steel,
And an axe silver-chased, I bid them bear;
Be this one meed to all. The foremost three
Shall receive prizes, and their heads be bound
With pale green olive. Let the first to wit,
As victor, have a horse with trappings proud;
The next an Amazonian quiver, filled
With Thracian arrows, which a broad gold belt
Circles, a smooth-gemmed buckle clasps; the third
Depart contented with this Argive helm."
This said, they take their stand, and suddenly,
The signal heard, catch at the course, and leave
The barriers, like a cloud poured forth, their eyes
Fixed on the finish. First draws ahead, darts far
Beyond all rivals Nisus, swifter he
Than wind or wings of lightning; next to him,
But next at a long distance, on his track
Comes Salius; then, some space between them left,
The third, Euryalus; Euryalus
Has Helymus behind him, close on whom
Flies, see! Diores, heel now grazing heel,
And shoulders jostling; and, were more space left,
He would slip past him, and leave doubt behind.
And now, the course nigh finished, with breath spent,
They neared the goal, when Nisus by ill luck
Slips in some blood chance-spilt upon the ground
From slaughtered steers, that soaked the greensward. Here
Just flushed with triumph, he could not keep his feet,
Tripped by the ground they trod on, but fell prone
Right in the foul dung and slain victims' gore.
Yet of Euryalus, yet of his heart's love
Not he forgetful! For in Salius' path
He cast him, rising through the slush, who, rolled
Over and over, on the thick soil lay.
Forth darts Euryalus, and the first place holds,
Winner by his friend's gift, and speeds him on
'Mid favouring shouts and tumult. Next to him
Comes following Helymus, and, now third prize,
Diores. But here Salius with loud shouts
Fills the whole concourse of the mighty ring
With gazing sires in front, reclaims the prize
Snatched from his hand by craft. Euryalus
Is strong in favour, and the grace of tears,
And worth, seen comelier in a lovely form.
Backs him Diores too with loud appeal,
Who, to a prize succeeding, has for naught
Gained the last guerdon, if the foremost place
Be given to Salius. Then Prince Aeneas:
"Your gifts remain assured you, boys, and none
Changes the order of the prize: let me
Pity my friend's unmerited mishap."
So saying, he gives to Salius the vast fell
Of a Gaetulian lion, with rough hair
Heavy, and claws of gold. Then Nisus: "If
Such be defeat's reward, and those that fell
Win pity of thee, what worthy recompense
Hast left for Nisus? The first crown was mine
By merit and exploit, had not the luck,
That frowned on Salius, frowned alike on me."
And with the word he shows his face and limbs
Smeared with wet filth. At him the gracious sire
Laughed, and a shield bade bring, the workmanship
Of Didymaon, by the Danai once
From Neptune's sacred portal torn. With this
He dowers the noble youth, a princely prize.
Then, the race ended, and the gifts dispensed,
"Come now," he cries, "and if in any breast
Be courage and prompt heart, let him approach,
Bind on the gloves, and lift his arms." So saying,
He names a twofold guerdon for the fray,
A steer for the winner, garlanded with gold,
Sword and proud helm, the vanquished to appease.
No pause: at once in all his giant strength
Uplifts him Dares, and stands forth to view
'Mid murmurs of the crowd, he who alone

# The Aeneid, Book V

Would match with Paris, and at the tomb wherein
Lies mightiest Hector conquering Butes smote—
Who with his vast bulk bore him to the field
Of the Bebrycian house of Amycus—
And stretched him dying upon the tawny sand.
Such was this Dares, who lifts high his head
First for the fray, displays his shoulders broad,
Launches his arms out, and spars right and left,
Lashing the air with buffets. Him to match
They seek another; but out of all that throng
No one durst face the champion, don the gloves.
So, deeming all men from the prize withdrew,
Promptly he plants him at Aeneas’ feet,
Tarrying no more, then by the left horn grasps
The bull, and speaks:
> “O goddess-born, if none
> Durst risk the fight, what end to waiting, say?
> How long befits it I stand loitering here?
> Bid me lead off the prize.”
The Dardans all,
Shouting with one voice, bade the promised boon
Be rendered to their champion. Hereupon
Acestes with stern words Entellus chides,
As he sat next him on the grassy couch:
> “Entellus, once most valiant, but in vain,
> Wilt thou such gifts see tamely borne away,
> And strike no blow? Where now, we ask, that god,
> Thy master, Eryx, idly vaunted? Where
> The fame that filled Trinacria, and those spoils
> Still hanging from thy roof-tree?”
He replied:
> “’Tis not that the love of fame is sped,
> Nor fear hath cast out honour; but indeed
> Chilled is my blood and dulled by sluggish eld,
> And all my body's strength numbed and outworn.
> If, which erst was, wherein yon braggart still
> Boldly exults, if now that youth were mine,
> I had not stayed for prize or noble steer
> To lure me forward, nor heed I the gifts.”

So saying, twin gauntlets of vast weights he hurls
Into the midst, wherewith keen Eryx wont
Advance his hand to battle, and bind his arms
With the tough hide. Astonied were all hearts;
So vast the seven huge ox-hides that lay stiff
With in-sewed lead and iron. More than all,
Dares himself stands dazed, and far recoils:
This way and that high-souled Anchises’ son
Poises and turns the thongs’ enormous folds.
Then the old man with deep-drawn accents spake:
> “What then if one had seen the gloves and arms
> Of Hercules himself, and the grim fight
> Upon this very strand? Those weapons once
> Thy brother Eryx wore: thou seest them yet
> Blood-stained and brain-bespattered: he with these
> Stood against great Alcides; to these I
> Myself was used, while sounder blood gave strength,
> Ere snowy age had sprinkled both my brows.
> But if the Trojan Dares shun these arms
> Of ours, and good Aeneas be set thereon,
> Backed by Acestes' sanction, fight we fair.
> I waive the hides of Eryx, calm thy dread,
> And do thou doff the Trojan gloves.”
So saying,
He from his shoulder flings the twofold robe,
Bares his huge limb-joints, mighty bones and thews,
And stands gigantic in the arena’s midst.
Then equal gloves the sire, Anchises’ son,
Brought, and with like arms bound the hands of both.
Straining on tip-toe, each at once took stand,
And raised his arms undaunted high toward heaven.
Their towering heads far from the blow withdrawn,
Fist with fist mingling, they provoke the fray.
One nimbler-footed, and relying on youth,
One strong in bulk of body; but his slow knees
Totter and quake, and all his mighty frame
Heaves with a painful panting. Many a blow
The champions idly bandy, each with each,
Many they rain on hollow flank, and make
Loud music on their chests; round ear and brow
The quick fist plays, jaws crackle with hard blows.
Ponderous in the selfsame posture stands
Unmoved Entellus, with his body alone
And watchful eye shunning the strokes. The other—
As who with engines batters a tall town,
Or sits down armed before some mountain-hold—
Tries this approach and that, and, hovering round
Artful at every point, plies him in vain
With manifold assault. Entellus then,
With right hand threatening and uplifted high,
Rose to the blow: which the other with quick glance
Foresaw descending, and with nimble frame
Slipped out of reach and foiled it. All his strength
Entellus spent on air, and, self-impelled,
By his own heaviness, heavily to the earth
Fell with prodigious weight; so falls at times
On Erymanthus or on Ida’s height
A hollow pine-tree by the roots up-torn.
Teucrians, Trinacrians, by one impulse urged,
Leap from their seats; a shout goes up to heaven;
And first Acestes hastes, and pityingly
Lifts from the earth his age-mate and his friend.
But he, nor checked nor daunted by the fall,
Returns yet keenlier to the fray; wrath goads
To violence: shame and conscious valour, too,
Kindle his strength; and all on fire he drives
Dares at headlong speed the whole course through,
Raining his buffets now with right, now left:
No stop, no respite: thick as hail, when clouds
Fall rattling on the roof, so pelt the blows
He showers on Dares, and with either hand
Pounds him and spins. Then Prince Aeneas brooked
Wrath go no further, nor Entellus yet
Rage on in bitterness of heart, but bade
The battle end, and rescued the spent strength
Of Dares, and thus speaks with soothing words:
> “Unhappy man! what craze hath caught thy soul?
> Dost not perceive that here is alien strength,
> Gods turned against thee? yield to heaven!”
He spake,
And with the word broke off the fight; but him
Dragging faint knees, his head to either side
Lolling, and spitting from his mouth thick gore
And teeth with blood commingled, his true friends
Lead to the ships: the helmet and the sword,
When summoned, they receive, the palm and bull
Leave to Entellus. Then the victor speaks,
Elate with pride, and glorying in the bull:
> “O goddess-born, and you, ye Teucrians, mark
> Both what was once my body’s youthful might,
> And Dares from what death your rescue saves.”
He spake, and fronting the steer’s forehead full,
Which stood there, prize of battle, drew aback
His right hand, levelled the tough gloves, and straight
’Twixt either horn, up-towering to the blow,
Crushed the skull inward, and dashed out the brain;
On earth stretched lifeless, quivering, the bull falls.
Then with deep utterance spake he over it:
> “This better life, for death of Dares due,
> Eryx, I pay thee— with this triumph crowned.
> The gauntlets and the boxer’s art lay by.”

Forthwith Aeneas to the swift arrow-match
Invites who will, and sets the prizes forth;
Then from Serestus’ ship with mighty hand
The mast uprears, and by a rope passed round
Suspends a fluttering dove from the tall top,
As target for their points. The men are met;
The thrown lot lies within a brazen helm,
And for first place outleaps, with favouring cheer,
The son of Hyrtacus, Hippocoon; next,
Late victor in the ship-race, Mnestheus comes,
Mnestheus now garlanded with olive green.
Eurytion was the third, brother to thee,
O most renowned Pandarus, who of old,
Bidden the treaty to confound, wert first
To hurl thy dart amid the Achaean ranks.
Last in the helmet’s depth Acestes lay,
Still bold of hand the tasks of youth to try.
Then, each for self, with sinewy might they bend
Their curving bows, pluck shaft from quiver; and first
The bolt of the son of Hyrtacus through heaven
Cleaves the fleet breezes from the whizzing string,
Arrives, and sticks in the mast-tree fair and full.
Quivered the mast, the bird clapped wings in fear,
And all the region rang with loud applause.
Next took his stand keen Mnestheus, bow drawn home,
High-pointing, with one level of shaft and eye;
He, luckless, the bird’s self with bolt to strike
Skilled not, but cut the noose and hempen cord,
Foot-bound whereby to the tall mast she hung:
Into the south winds and black clouds she flew.
Then, bow long since held ready, and bolt on string,
With a quick prayer to his brother to hear his vows,
Eurytion marked the dove, now triumphing
In the free sky, and, as she clapped her wings
Under a dark cloud, pierced her. Dead she fell,
And left her life among the stars of heaven,
Down-trailing with the arrow in her side.
Acestes, the prize lost, alone remained.
Yet upward aimed his bolt into the air,
Showing an old sire’s skill and sounding bow.
Here on their eyes a sudden portent falls,
To prove of mighty presage; the event
Taught them its vastness in the after-time,
And awful seers their omen sang too late.
For, on its flight amid the floating clouds,
The reed took fire, and traced a path in flame,
And into thin air burnt itself away;
As oft, from heaven unfixed, shoot flying stars,
And trail their locks behind them. All, aghast,
Stood rooted, and implored the gods of heaven,
Trinacrian folk and Teucrian: nor did great
Aeneas spurn the omen, but his arms
Cast about glad Acestes, whom he loads
With mighty gifts, thus speaking:
> “Take them, sire;
> For by such tokens great Olympus’ king
> To thee no lot-drawn honour hath decreed.
> From old Anchises’ self this gift be thine,
> A bowl embossed with figures, which of yore
> Cisseus the Thracian as a noble gift
> Gave to my sire Anchises, of his love
> The record and the pledge to bear.”
This said,
He wreathes his temples with green bay, and hails
First, before all, Acestes victor, nor
Did kind Eurytion grudge the rank preferred,
Albeit he only struck the bird from heaven.
Next for the prize comes in who cut the cord,
Last with fleet arrow he that pierced the pine.
But Prince Aeneas, ere the sports were sped,
Calls to his side Epytides, the squire
Who watched o’er young Iulus, and thus speaks
Into his faithful ear:
> “Hie thee, and bid
> Ascanius, if his boyish band he now
> Have ready, and his manoeuvring troop arrayed,
> Lead forth the squadron in his grandsire’s name,
> And show himself in arms.”
Such charge he gave,
And with his own voice bids the crowd withdraw,
Flooding the long course, and the field be cleared.
The boys ride in, before their fathers’ eyes
Glittering on bridled horses in array,
By all Trinacria’s chivalry and Troy’s
Hailed with admiring murmurs as they go.
The locks of all a trim wreath duly binds,
Each bears two cornel spear-shafts tipped with steel,
Some polished quivers upon the shoulder; high
On breast, along the throat there runs a hoop
Pliant of twisted gold. The companies
Of horse are three; three chiefs ride to and fro,
And, following each, a band of twice six boys,
The troop trisected, with like leaders, shine.
One youthful squadron a child-Priam leads
To victory, and recalls his grandsire’s name,
Thy glorious seed, Polites, soon to swell
The tribes of Italy; a Thracian steed
Bears him, with white spots dappled, that displays
White-stepping pasterns, and white-towering brow.
The next is Atys, from whom trace their line
The Latin Atii; the child Atys, loved
Of his boy-friend Iulus. Last appears,
In beauty before all, Iulus’ self
On a Sidonian horse, fair Dido’s gift,
Of her heart's love the record and the pledge.
The remnant ride Trinacrian steeds of old
Acestes. With a cheer the Dardan folk
Welcome the timid lads, and gaze with joy,
Tracing the features of their sires of old.
When the gay cavalcade had ridden the round
Of the whole concourse under their friends’ eyes,
And all were ready, Epytides from far
Shouted the signal and cracked loud his whip.
They rushed apart symmetric, in three troops
With open ranks dividing, and once more
Wheel at the order, and charge point to point.
Then other onsets and retreats they try
In quarters opposite, and interweave
Circle with circle, each with each, and wake
The semblance of armed warfare, now expose
Their backs in flight, now point their levelled spears,
Now with peace plighted, as close comrades, ride.
As erst the labyrinth in lofty Crete
Had, as folk tell, a way with blind walls woven,
And a dark trap with thousand paths perplexed,
Whose maze unsearched and irretraceable
Might balk all clues for following, such the course
Wherein the Trojan boys their steps involve,
Weaving the sportive web of flight and fray:
As dolphins, swimming through the watery seas,
Carpathian cleave or Libyan, and make sport
Amid the waves. Such use of horsemanship,
Such games as these, Ascanius, as he girt
With walls his Alba Longa, first revived,
And trained the ancient Latins to the mode
Of his own boyhood with the youth of Troy;
The Albans taught their sons; from whom bequeathed
Majestic Rome received and kept alive
The ancestral rite: now, named from Troy, the lads
Are called the Trojan troop. Thus far were held
The games in honour of the sacred sire.
Here Fortune changing first revoked her faith.
Whilst they with various pastime to the tomb
Render due rites, Saturnian Juno now
Sends Iris from on high to Ilium’s fleet,
And breathes fair winds to waft her, rife with schemes,
Still of her ancient smart insatiate. She,
Speeding along her myriad-tinted bow,
Shoots down the swift track, maid beheld of none.
She views the mighty throng, and scans the shore
And sees the harbour void, the fleet forsook.
But far withdrawn upon a lonely beach
The Trojan dames wept for Anchises’ loss,
And, weeping, all together eyed the deep.
Ah, what vast floods, what weary length of sea
Was still before them, with one voice they cry.
They crave a city, the travail of the main
Sick of enduring. So into their midst,
Well versed in harm, she flings her, doffs the face
And garb of goddess, becomes Beroe,
The aged wife of Tmarian Doryclus,
Who once had lineage, and a name, and sons;
So ’mid the Dardan mothers makes her way.
> “O hapless women, whom no Greek hand in war
> Dragged ’neath your native walls to death,” she cries,
> "O race ill-starred, for what destruction, say,
> Doth fate reserve ye? Since Troy’s overthrow,
> The seventh summer now wheels her course, the while,
> Borne over seas and traversing all lands,
> So many inhospitable rocks and climes,
> We chase the still receding Italy
> On the vast ocean, by its billows tossed.
> Here are our brother Eryx’ bounds, our host
> Acestes: who forbids to cast up walls,
> And give a city to our countrymen?
> O fatherland, and household gods in vain
> Snatched from the foeman, shall no city bear
> Troy’s name for ever? Nowhere shall I see
> A Simois or a Xanthus, Hector’s streams?
> Nay up, and help me burn the ill-omened ships!
> For in my sleep the seer Cassandra’s shade
> Appeared, methought, and offered blazing brands.
> ‘Here look for Troy; here is your home,’ quoth she.
> The hour is ripe for action; prodigies
> So mighty brook no tarriance. Lo ye, four
> Altars to Neptune! and the god himself
> Supplies the firebrand and the will.”
So saying,
She, snatching first the deadly flame, upreared
Aloft her right hand, brandished with main strength,
And threw it. Brain-wildered were the Trojan dames,
And heart-astonied. Then, of many, one
In years their eldest, Pyrgo, royal nurse
Of all those sons of Priam, cries,
> “See you not,
> This is no Beroe, no Rhoeteian wife
> Of Doryclus, good mothers! Mark the signs
> Of heavenly beauty, and the glowing eyes:
> What breath about her! what a glance she hath!
> What tone of voice, and stateliness of step!
> Nay, I myself left Beroe only now,
> Sick, chafing that she only in such rite
> Should lack a part, nor to Anchises pay
> The honours due to him.”
So spake she. But
The matrons, wavering at the first, ’gan eye
The ships with looks malign, halting between
Infatuate passion for their present land
And realms that called them with the voice of fate.
But on poised wings the goddess borne through heaven
Cut, flying, a mighty bow beneath the clouds.
Then, by the portent crazed, and frenzy-spurred,
All from their hearths’ recesses, with one shout,
Snatch fire; some strip the altars, and fling on
Leaf, brushwood, bough. With loose rein Vulcan riots
O’er thwarts and oars and sterns of painted pine.
To Anchises’ barrow and the circus-seats
Eumelus of the blazing fleet brings word.
Then glancing back they see the pitchy reek
Float in a cloud. And first Ascanius,
Then gaily leading his manoeuvring troop,
Rode at full speed to the disordered camp,
Even as he was, nor can his breathless guards
Detain him.
> “What new frenzy is this?” he cries,
> “Or whither now, say whither are ye bound,
> My wretched countrywomen? ’Tis no foe,
> No hostile camp of Argives, that ye burn,
> But your own hopes. See, it is I, your own
> Ascanius!”
And before his feet he flung
The empty helmet, wherewith armed but now
He woke in sport the counterfeit of war.
At once Aeneas, at once the Teucrian train
Speed to the spot. But scattering o’er the beach,
This way and that the affrighted women fly,
Make for the woods by stealth, and wheresoe’er
The rocks are caverned: now they loathe the deed
And daylight, know their own with altered eye,
And Juno’s power is shaken from their soul.
But not for that the conflagration’s blaze
Slacks its resistless fury: the tow glows
Beneath the wet wood, spewing forth slow smoke;
The creeping heat devours the keels, a plague
That sinks through all the vessels’ bulk, nor strength
Of men, nor showers of water can avail.
Then good Aeneas from off his shoulders rent
The raiment, and besought the gods for aid,
With outstretched hands:
> “Almighty Jupiter,
> If all the Trojans, to a man, not yet
> Thou hatest, if thy goodness of old time
> Recks aught of human woes, grant that the flames
> Now ’scape our fleet, O father, and pluck thou
> The Teucrians’ shrunken power from ruin. Else
> Level thy thunderbolt, and what remains
> Hurl down to death, if such be my desert,
> And overwhelm us here with thy right hand.”
Scarce had he spoken, when with outpoured showers
A black storm rages, uncontrollable;
Earth trembles to the thunder, hill and plain;
From the whole welkin a wild water-flood
Comes rushing, pitch-black from the thickening south;
The ships are filled, and over; the half-burnt
Timbers are soaked; till all the heat is quenched,
And, four keels lost, all else escape the plague.
But Prince Aeneas, stunned by the shrewd chance,
Shifted and turned the mighty load of care
Within his breast, now this way, and now that,
Whether to settle in Sicilian fields,
Heedless of fate, or grasp Italia’s shore.
Then aged Nautes, whom of all men most
Tritonian Pallas taught, and with much lore
Made famous— she it was declared to him
That which or heaven’s high wrath portended or
Fate’s course required— he thus bespake Aeneas
With comfortable words:
> “O goddess-born,
> Pull or repel they, follow we the fates;
> Betide what will, fortune in every phase
> Is conquered but by bearing. Here thou hast
> Acestes of the Dardan stock divine:
> Him take, a willing yoke-fellow, to share
> Thy counsels; unto him deliver those
> Who are left shipless, or have weary grown
> Both of thy fortunes and the great emprise.
> Men full of years, and mothers wearied out
> With ocean, and whatever of weak thou hast,
> Fearful of danger, choose, and in this land
> Give ramparts to the weary ones. Their town,
> Grant thou the name, Acesta shall be called.”
Fired by such words from his friend’s aged lips,
Now was his soul with care on care distraught.
And black night, chariot-lifted, held the sky,
When sudden lo! the likeness of his sire
Anchises seemed to glide from heaven, and speak
With such-like utterance:
> “Son, than life to me
> Dearer, while life was mine— son, sorely tasked
> By Ilium’s destinies, hither I come
> At Jove’s command, who from thy fleet drave off
> The fire, and hath at length ta’en pity on thee
> Out of high heaven. Obey the goodly rede
> Now given by aged Nautes; men of choice,
> The bravest hearts, lead on to Italy;
> Hardy the race, and rude of life, which thou
> In Latium must war down. First none the less
> Approach the infernal halls of Dis, and through
> Avernus’ depth seek colloquy with me,
> My son. For guilty Tartarus holds me not,
> Nor the sad ghosts, but in Elysium
> ’Mid fair assemblies of the blest I dwell.
> Thither with plenteous bloodshed of black kine
> The Sibyl pure shall lead thee. Then shalt thou
> Learn all thy kindred, and what walls are given.
> And now farewell! dank night her midway course
> Is wheeling, and the Orient’s panting steeds
> Breathe pitiless upon me.”
He had said,
And passed, like vapour, into empty air.
> “Ah! whither hurrying, whither whirled away?”
Exclaims Aeneas,
> “whom fliest thou, or who
> Bars thee from my embraces?”
With that word
He wakes the embers and the slumbering fire,
And with pure meal and brimming censer pays
Honour to Troy’s Lar and hoar Vesta’s shrine.
Straight summons he his friends, Acestes first,
Of Jove’s command and his dear sire’s behest
Instructs them, and what purpose now stands fixed
Within his soul. None hinder the design,
Nor thwarts his word Acestes. They transfer
The matrons to their city, and set on shore
Who would, such souls as crave not high renown.
Themselves repair the thwarts, and shape afresh
The fire-gnawed ship-beams, and fit oars and ropes,
Few, but a pulse of manhood quick for war.
Aeneas meanwhile is marking with a plough
The city-boundaries, and assigning homes,
Bids here an Ilium, here a Troy to be.
Trojan Acestes, glorying in his realm,
Proclaims a court, and to the assembled sires
Gives laws. To Venus of Idalium then
Nigh to the stars, on Eryx’ top, they found
A dwelling and Anchises' tomb endow
With priest and grove of widespread sanctity.
Now the whole race nine days have wassail held,
And to the altars is due honour done:
Calm winds have laid the ocean, and once more
Auster with quickening breath invites to sea.
Uprises hark! along the winding shore
A mighty wail: clasped in each other’s arms
They linger out the hours of night and day.
Now e’en the matrons, e’en the men, who late
Shuddered at ocean’s face, scarce brooked its name,
Fain would set forth, bear all the toil of flight.
Them kind Aeneas soothes with friendly words,
And, weeping, to Acestes’ care consigns,
His kinsman. Then to Eryx he bids slay
Three heifers, and a ewe lamb to the storms,
And duly loose the moorings. He himself,
Bound with trim olive-leaves about his head,
Stands high upon the prow, and holds a bowl,
Into the salt waves flings the entrails far,
And pours clear-flowing wine. Rising astern,
A breeze escorts them on their way. The crews
With emulous oar-strokes sweep the ocean plain.
Venus meanwhile, to cares a prey, thus pleads
With Neptune, and pours out her heart’s complaint:
> “Juno’s fell wrath and heart insatiable
> Constrain me, Neptune, stoop to every prayer.
> No lapse of time, no goodness can assuage,
> Nor Jove’s command, nor fate itself, avail
> To break and tame her. With outrageous hate
> ’Twas not enough from ’midst the Phrygian folk
> To eat away their city, and drag them on
> Through every retribution: what remains,
> The very dust and bones of perished Troy,
> She persecutes. Let her own heart resolve
> The causes of such madness. Thou thyself
> Art witness, on the Libyan waves but now
> What sudden coil she raised— mixed all the seas
> With heaven, upon the storms of Aeolus
> Vainly relying, and dared it in thy realm.
> See, too, Troy’s matrons goading into crime,
> Their ships she hath burnt foully, forcing them,
> With minished fleet, upon an unknown shore
> To leave their comrades. Those that yet remain—
> Let them, I pray thee of thy goodness, spread
> Safe sail across the billows; let them reach
> Laurentian Tiber, lawful if my suit,
> If there the walls by destiny assigned.”
Then Saturn’s son, the lord of the deep sea,
Made answer:
> “Cytherea, ’tis full meet
> Thou trust this realm of mine, that gave thee birth;
> And I have earned it: often have I quelled
> Such wrath and fury both of sea and sky,
> Nor less on land, Xanthus and Simois
> Attest, hath thine Aeneas been my care.
> What time Achilles, the disheartened hosts
> Of Troy pursuing, dashed them on their walls,
> And many thousands did to death, till groaned
> The choked-up rivers, nor could Xanthus find
> A passage, and roll out to sea, then I
> Seeing Aeneas with brave Peleus’ son
> Ill-matched alike in strength and aid from heaven,
> In a cloud’s hollow caught him, though full fain
> From their foundation to cast down the walls
> Of perjured Troy, that mine own hands had built.
> Now too within me the same purpose holds;
> Away with fear! unscathed he shall arrive
> The Avernian havens, goal of thy desire;
> One only shall there be, thou’lt seek in vain
> Upon the flood, one life for many given.”
So soothing with his words the goddess’ heart
To gladness, the Sire yokes his steeds with gold,
Fastens to their wild mouths the foaming bit,
And, through his hands out-slackening all the reins,
Skims light the sea-top in his azure car.
Down sink the waves; the swelling water-floor
Beneath his thunderous wheel is levelled smooth;
The clouds fly routed through the vast of air.
Then to attend him came shapes manifold,
Monsters enormous, Glaucus’ aged choir,
Palaemon son of Ino, and the swift
Tritons, and Phorcus with his whole array;
Thetis upon the left, and Melite,
And maiden Panopea, and Nisaee,
Spio, Thalia, and Cymodoce.
Then lo! through Prince Aeneas’ tortured soul
Thrills the sweet solace of returning joy;
Quickly he bids each mast be reared, each sail
Stretched on the yardarms. All made taut the sheet
Together, with one accord, now left, now right,
Slackening the canvas; all together turn
And turn again the lofty sail-yard horns;
The winds they wait for, bear the fleet along.
First, before all, leading the dense array,
Was Palinurus, others after him
Bidden to shape their course. Now dewy night
Had well-nigh reached the mid-way goal of heaven;
In slumber calm the crews relaxed their limbs
Beneath the oars, on the hard benches stretched,
When Sleep slid lightly from the stars on high,
Parted the dusky air, and cleft the gloom,
Thee, Palinurus, seeking, and for thee
Fraught with a fatal dream, though innocent.
There on the high stern sat the god, and, like
To Phorbas, pours this utterance from his lips:
> “O Palinurus, son of Iasides,
> See, of its own will ocean wafts the fleet;
> The gales breathe equably; the hour is given
> To slumber. Bow the head, and steal from toil
> The weary eyes. Myself awhile will take
> Thy task upon me.”
With scarce lifted look,
To him speaks Palinurus:
> “Bid’st thou me
> Mark not the sea’s smooth face and tranquil waves?
> Put faith in such a monster? Wherefore trust
> Aeneas to the false breezes, tempt again
> The oft-rued treachery of a smiling sky?”
Such words he spake, and clutched and clung, nor aught
Let go the tiller, and held his upward eyes
Still fixed upon the stars: when lo! the god
O’er either temple shakes a bough besprent
With Lethe-dew, and drugged with Stygian power,
That loosed his swimming eyes, reluctant. Scarce
Had the first stealth of unexpected sleep
Slackened his limbs, when, bending from above,
It hurled him headlong, half the stern torn off,
Rudder and all, into the weltering waves,

# The Aeneid V

With many a cry to friends that could not aid. 859
But into empty air the vision’s self
Soared on the wing. Natheless the fleet unscathed
Speeds on its journey, and rides undismayed
In Father Neptune’s promise. And now it neared
The Siren-crags, found perilous of old,
Whitened with bones of many, while the rocks
With ceaseless surge were booming hoarse afar.
Soon as the Prince perceived his vessel drift
Aimless for lack of helmsman, he himself
Over the midnight wave, with many a groan,
Steered her, sore shaken by his friend’s mischance:
“O all too trustful of the smiling face
Of sky and ocean, on an unknown shore,
And naked, Palinurus, thou wilt lie.” 871

## Book VI

Weeping he spake, and gave his fleet the rein.
And to Euboean Cumae’s shore at length
Glides smoothly in. They turn prows seaward; then
The anchors’ tooth ’gan grip the vessels fast;
The round sterns rim the beach. Outleaps amain
The war-host on Hesperia’s strand; some search
For seeds of fire hid deep in veins of flint;
Some scour the wild beasts’ tangled forest-lairs,
Or point to new-found streams. But good Aeneas
Makes for the hill-top, where aloft sits throned
Apollo, and a cavern vast, the far
Lone haunt of the dread Sibyl, into whom
The Delian bard his mighty mind and soul
Breathes, and unlocks the future. Even now
’Neath Trivia’s grove and golden roof they come.
Daedalus, flying from Minos’ realm, ’tis said,
Dared on swift wings to trust him to the sky.
Upon his uncouth journey floated forth
Toward the chill Bears, and stood light-poised at last
On the Chalcidian hill. Here first to earth
Restored, he dedicated to thy name,
Phoebus, the oarage of his wings, and built
A giant temple. On the doors behold!
The murder of Androgeos; therewithal
The sons of Cecrops, bidden, alas! to pay
For yearly ransom, seven of their sons’ lives:
The urn stands, and the lots are drawn. Uptowers
From Ocean, fronting it, the Gnosian land:
Here her fell love o’ the bull, Pasiphae
Mated by cunning, and, that mongrel-birth,
The Minotaur, a twy-formed offspring, stands,
Record of monstrous passion; here was that
Laborious dwelling with the wandering maze,
Inextricable, but that Daedalus,
Pitying the princess’ mighty passion, solved
Himself the riddle of its winding paths,
Guiding blind footsteps with a thread. Thou too
In such a work hadst borne a mighty part,
Had grief allowed, O Icarus. Thy fall
Twice had he sought in gold to fashion, twice
The father’s hands dropped. Aye, and still their eyes
O’er all would have been ranging, had not now
Come from his quest Achates, and with him,
Priestess of Phoebus and of Trivia,
Deiphobe, Glaucus’ child, who therewithal
Thus hails the king: “Such shows a time like this
Demands not: better were it now to slay
Seven bullocks from the unbroken herd, and ewes
Picked duly of like number.” Having thus
Addressed Aeneas—nor were the heroes slack
To do her sacred bidding—the priestess now
Summons the Teucrians into the high fane.

The mighty face of the Euboean rock
Is scooped into a cavern, whither lead
A hundred wide ways, and a hundred gates;
Aye, and therefrom as many voices rush,
The answers of the Sibyl. They had gained
The threshold, when the maid exclaims: “ ’Tis time
To ask the oracles; lo! the god, the god!”
Before the doors thus speaking, suddenly
Nor countenance, nor hue, nor braided locks
Stayed in one fashion: but her bosom heaves,
Her heart swells wild with frenzy; and more vast
She seems, nor mortal rings her voice, when now
Touched by the nearer breath of deity.
“So slack to vows and prayers,” she cries, “so slack,
Trojan Aeneas? for the mighty mouths
Of the awed temple will not ope till then.”
So spake she, and was mute. A shudder chill
Ran through the Teucrians’ hardy frames, the while
Their king from his heart’s deepest pours forth
prayer. 55

“O Phoebus, who the heavy woes of Troy
Hast always pitied, who erst the Dardan shaft
And hand of Paris didst guide against the bulk
Of the son of Aeacus, at thy bidding I
Pierced all those seas that roam round mighty shores,
The far-withdrawn Massylian tribes, and fields
That skirt their quicksands, till at length we grasp
The flying shores of Italy: thus far
Let Troy’s ill fate have followed her. Ye too
May justly spare the race of Pergamus,
Gods all and goddesses, to whom Ilium
And the vast Dardan fame was an offence.
And thou most holy seer, who dost foreknow
The future, grant—I do but ask the realm
Owed to my destiny—that Teucria’s sons
May rest in Latium with their wandering gods,
And storm-tossed Trojan deities. Then I
To Phoebus and to Trivia will uprear
A shrine of solid marble, and holy days
In name of Phoebus. And thee too awaits
In our new realm a mighty sanctuary. 77
For there thine oracles and mystic dooms,
Spoke to my people, will I set, and choose
Men, and ordain them thine, O gracious one.
Only to leaves commit not thou thy strains,
Lest they fly scattered, sport of whirling winds;
Chant them with thine own lips, I pray.” He made
An end of speaking. But the seer, not yet
Patient of Phoebus, in the cavern storms
Immeasurably, if haply from her breast
She may shake off the mighty god; but he
So much the rather plies her raving mouth,
Tames her wild heart, and moulds her to his might. 80

And now the temple’s hundred monster-gates
Ope of themselves, and through the air convey
The answers of the Sibyl: “O thou that hast
Outborne at length the sea’s vast perils, know
Yet worse on shore await thee. True, the sons
Of Dardanus to Lavinium’s realm shall come;
Of this care ease thy bosom; yet shall it not
Rejoice them of their coming. War, grim war,
And Tiber foaming high with blood, I see. 87
Simois and Xanthus and a Dorian camp
There shalt thou lack not; yea, for Latium
Even now a new Achilles hath been found,
Himself too goddess-born. Nor anywhere
Shall Juno from the Teucrians hold her hand,
While, suppliant in thy need through Italy,
What race, what city, shalt thou leave unsued?
Once more is cause of all the Teucrians’ woe
An alien bride, once more a foreign bed.
Yield not to ills, but face them boldlier thou,
Even as thy fortune suffers thee. The first
Pathway to safety, little as thou deem’st,
Shall from a Grecian town appear.” In such
Words from the shrine doth Cumae’s Sibyl chant
Her awful riddles, and echo through the cave,
In darkness shrouding truth; so shakes the reins
Apollo in her raving mouth, and plies
Deep in her breast the goad. Soon as had ebbed
Her frenzy, and the frantic lips were still,
The hero speaks—Aeneas: “No phase of toil
To me, O maid, strange or unlooked for comes. 103
All things have I forecast, and in my mind
Traversed ere seen. One boon I beg: since this
Is called the portal of the infernal king,
And the dark pool of Acheron’s overflow,
Let me to my dear sire’s own presence pass;
Teach thou the way, and ope the sacred gates.
Him I through flames and thousand following darts
Rescued upon these shoulders, and bore safe
From midst the foemen: he, my wayfellow,
Endured with me all seas, all threats of sky
And ocean, weak of body, beyond the lot
And strength of age. Moreover he it was
Charged and implored me with this suppliant suit
Thy threshold to approach. Both son and sire
Pity, I pray thee, of thy grace; for thou
Canst all things, nor for naught hath Hecate
Made thee the mistress of Avernian groves. 118
If Orpheus could recall his loved one’s shade,
Armed but with Thracian harp and tuneful strings,
If Pollux, dying in turn, redeemed his brother,
Trod and retrod the way so oft—why speak
Of mighty Theseus, of Alcides why?
My lineage also is from Jove in heaven.”
So spake he praying, and clasped the altar; then
The seer brake silence: “Sprung from blood of gods,
Trojan Anchises’ son, easy the road
Down to Avernus: night and day the door
Of gloomy Dis stands open; but thy steps
Back to retrace, emerge to upper air,
This is the task, the labour this. Some few,
Favoured and loved of Jupiter, or borne
By their own glowing virtue to the sky,
Sons of the gods, attained it. All between
Is forest-clothed, and with black-gliding coil
Cocytus winds about it. But if thou
So yearn’st at heart, if such thy longing, twice
To stem the Stygian pool, twice view the gloom
Of Tartarus; and it please thee to give play
To a mad quest, hear what must first be done.
Hid in a tree’s dark shade there lurks a bough,
Gold both in leaf and limber twig, and called
Sacred to nether Juno. All the grove
Hides it, by obscure valleys closed in gloom.
But none may probe the vaults of earth or ere
He pluck the gold-tressed sapling from the tree.
This to be brought as her peculiar gift
Fair Proserpine ordained. The first torn off,
Fails not a second, gold no less, whose spray
Sprouts of the selfsame ore. So with thine eyes
Search deep, and, duly finding, with thy hand
Pluck it, for freely at a touch ’twill yield,
If thou art called of fate: not, otherwise,
By any force wilt thou prevail to win,
Or with hard steel to tear it. Furthermore
The breathless corse of one that was thy friend
Still lies—alas! thou know'st not—and with death
Taints the whole fleet, while on our threshold here
Thou hoverest, seeking counsel. Him first bear
To his own place, and hide in tomb, and bring
Black cattle in expiation, before all: 133
So shalt thou see at last the Stygian groves,
And realms unfooted by the quick.” She spake,
And with closed lips was silent.

But Aeneas
With downcast eyes and gloomy brow strides on,
Quitting the cave, alone with his own heart
Revolving hidden issues. At his side
Goes true Achates, with like load of care
Planting his footsteps. Many a thought they wove
In varying converse—of what lifeless friend
The priestess spake, what corse for burial. So
At length arrived, on the dry beach they see
Misenus, snatched by an untimely death,
Misenus, son of Aeolus, than whom
None more renowned with clarion’s clang to rouse
Heroes, and fire the war-god with his blast. 163
Great Hector he had served, at Hector’s side,
Famous alike for trumpet and for spear,
Would join the fray: whom when Achilles quelled
And robbed of life, he, bravest of the brave,
Had ta’en Aeneas the Dardan for his lord,
Following no meaner destiny. But then,
While with his hollow shell he thrills the main,
Madman, and challenges the gods to match
His music, Triton, if the tale be true,
Seized him, in jealousy, and under sea
Plunged in a moment amid foaming rocks.
So all around they clamoured with loud cries,
And, foremost, good Aeneas. Then with speed
The Sibyl’s bidding they dispatch with tears,
A funeral-altar toiling to upbuild
Of heaped boughs, and rear it to the sky. 178
Into an ancient forest forth they fare,
The wild beasts’ lofty cover. Down go the pines.
Loud rings the ilex to the smiting axe,
And ash-trees and the splintering heart of oak
Are cleft with wedges: from the hills they roll
Huge mountain-ashes down. Aeneas, no less
Foremost amid such toil, cheers on his friends,
And girds him with like weapons. Then alone
With his sad heart he ponders, gazing o’er
The boundless forest, and thus prays aloud: 186
“If now that golden branch upon the tree
Might to our eyes in this vast grove appear!
Since all too truly spake the prophetess
Of thee, alas! Misenus.” Scarce had he
Uttered the word, when, as it happed, twin doves
Under his very eyes from heaven came flying,
And light on the green sod. The mighty chief,
His mother’s birds discerning, prays with joy:
“Oh! be my guides, if any path there be,
And steer your airy course into the grove,
Where the rich bough o’ershades the fertile ground.
And our perplexity forsake not thou,
O goddess-mother.” So saying, he stops to mark
What signs they bring, their course bend whitherward. 198
They, feeding, still fly forward just so far
As the pursuer’s eye might bear in sight.
Then, having gained Avernus’ poisonous jaws,
Swiftly they mount, and, gliding through clear air,
Perch both, and settle upon the wished-for tree,
Flashed through whose boughs the gold’s contrasting
gleam.
As mistletoe, when winter chills the woods,
Bursts into new leaf, sown on alien tree,
And, saffron-berried, clips the tapering trunk,
Such was the seeming of that leafy gold
On the dark ilex; so in the light breeze
Rustled the foil. Aeneas instantly
Seizes and rives it from its lingering hold
With hungry clutch, and bears it ’neath the roof
Of the prophetic Sibyl. 211
Nor less meanwhile
The Teucrians on the shore Misenus wept,
Paying the last dues to the thankless dust.
First, rich with pine-brands, of hewn timber vast,
A pyre they raise, with dark leaves wreathe the sides,
Plant funeral-cypresses in front, above
Deck it with gleaming arms. Some set to heat
Water, and cauldrons heaving on the flame,
And wash the death-cold body, and anoint,
And make loud moaning. Then the wept-for limbs
Upon the couch they lay, and over them
Cast purple robes, the well-known raiment: some,
Sad service, bowed them to the heavy bier,
And, eyes averted, their ancestral wont,
Applied the torch and held. The heaped gifts blaze—
Frankincense, viands, and bowls of streaming oil. 225
When sank the embers, and the flame was stilled,
The remnant of the thirsty dust they drench
With wine, and Corynaeus gathered up,
And in a brazen casket hid, the bones.
He with pure water, too, thrice paced the round
Of comrades, with the light dew sprinkling them
From bough of fruitful olive, and purified
The heroes, and spake out the latest words.
But good Aeneas, for tomb, a mighty mound
Heaps o’er the dead, and his own arms, both oar
And trumpet, ’neath a skyey mount, which now
From him is called Misenus, and preserves
From age to age his everlasting name. 255

This done, with speed he girds him to fulfil
The Sibyl’s bidding: a deep cave there was
With huge gape monstrous, jagged, and hemmed in
By the dark mere and forest’s gloom, o’er which
Nothing that flies could wing a scathless way,
Such breath from the black jaws outpouring sped
Into the vault of heaven (from whence the Greeks
Have called the place Aornos). And here first
The priestess ranges four black-bodied bulls,
Pours wine upon their brows, and ’twixt the horns
Plucking as first-fruit throws the topmost tuft
Into the sacred flames, calling aloud
On Hecate, queen both in heaven and hell. 277
Others set knives beneath them, and in bowls
Catch the warm blood. Aeneas a black-fleeced lamb,
Unto the mother of the Eumenides
And her great sister, with his own sword strikes,
A barren heifer, O Proserpine, to thee,
Then to the Stygian king inaugurates
Altars by night, and casts upon the fire
Whole carcasses of bulls, pouring fat oil
Upon the blazing entrails. But behold!
Hard upon dawn and sunrise, ’neath their feet
The ground ’gan rumble, and a-quaking fell
The forest-ridges, and through the gloom there
seemed
Dogs howling, as the goddess drew anigh.
“Hence, hence, unhallowed ones!” the priestess
shrieks;
“From the whole grove avaunt! and thou, Aeneas,
Set forth upon the road, pluck sword from sheath;
Now need’st thou all thy courage and a stout heart.” 261
Thus far she spake, and like a fury plunged
Into the cave’s mouth: he, no falterer, keeps
Pace with the steps of his advancing guide.
Gods of the spirit-realm, and voiceless shades,
And Chaos and Phlegethon, vast tracts of night
And silence, grant me, what mine ear hath heard
To utter, and, with your fiat, to unfold
Things whelmed in darkness and the under-world.
On strode they blindly through the gloom, beneath
The solitary night, through the void halls
And ghostly realms of Dis: as men may walk
The wood-way ’neath a coy moon’s grudging light,
When Jupiter with shade hath curtained heaven,
And black night of her colour robs the world. 272

Fronting the portal, even in Orcus’ jaws,
Grief and avenging Cares have made their bed;
And pale Diseases house, and dolorous Eld,
And Fear and Famine, counsellor of crime,
And loathly Want, shapes terrible to view.
And Death and Travail, and, Death’s own brother,
Sleep,
And the soul’s guilty joys, and murderous War
Full on the threshold, and the iron cells
Of the Eumenides, and mad Discord, who
With blood-stained fillet wreaths her snaky locks. 281
Spreads in the midst her boughs and aged arms
An elm, huge, shadowy, where vain dreams, ’tis said,
Are wont to roost them, under every leaf
Close-clinging: and many a monster-form beside
Of various beasts—Centaurs against the door
Are stalled, and twy-formed Scyllas, and Briareus,
He of the hundred hands, and Lerna’s brute
Horribly hissing, Chimaera armed with flames,
Gorgons and Harpies, and the shadowy shape
Three-bodied. Here, in a tremor of sudden fear,
Grasped at his sword Aeneas, and with bare edge
Opposed their coming, and, but for warning word
From his wise comrade that they were but thin
Unbodied lives, ’neath hollow shows of form
Flitting, upon them he would rush, and cleave
Shadows in twain with ineffectual sword. 294
Hence runs a road to the Tartarean waves
Of Acheron leading, where his eddying gulf,
Seething with mud and a wild whirlpool, boils
Into Cocytus belching all his sand.
These floods and waters a grim ferryman
Guards, of fell squalor, Charon, on whose chin
Lies a thick grizzle, all untrimmed; his eyes
Are orbs of staring fire, and by a knot
Hangs from his shoulders a soiled garb. Himself
Plies with a pole his craft, and tends the sails,
Freighting with dead the dusky barge; now old,
But with the age of godhead hale and green.
Toward him the whole crowd rushing floods the
bank;
Matrons and men, and great heroic frames
Done with life’s service, boys, unwedded girls,
Youths placed on pyre before their father’s eyes: 305
Countless as forest-leaves that fluttering fall
In the first chill of autumn, or as birds
Flock countless shoreward from the weltering deep,
When the chill year, now chasing over-sea,
Drives them to sunny lands. There stood they praying
Each to be first o’erferried, and stretched forth
Their hands with yearning for the further shore.
But the sour boatman takes now these, now those,
And others from the strand thrusts far aloof.
Aeneas, sore startled by the tumult, cries:
“Say, maid, what means this thronging to the stream? 315
What seek the spirits? or by what law quit these
The brink, skim those the leaden oar-swept tide?”
Briefly to him the aged priestess spake:
“Anchises’ son, sure offspring of the gods,
Cocytus’ deep pools and the Stygian marsh
Here thou discernest, by whose power the gods
Fear to swear falsely; helpless, tombless all
This crowd, which thou behold’st; yon ferryman
Is Charon; those that cross have found a grave.
But o’er the dread banks and hoarse-sounding flood
Waft them he may not, till their bones have rest. 328
A hundred years about these shores they flit
And wander, then at length, their ban removed,
The longed-for pools revisit.” Anchises’ son
Halted, and stayed his steps, revolving much,
And pitying from his heart their cruel fate.
There—woful forms, and lacking death’s last due—
Leucaspis and Orontes he espies,
Chief of the Lycian fleet, whom both, from Troy
Borne over squally seas, the South o’erwhelmed,
Winding in watery shroud both craft and crew. 336
Lo! there the helmsman Palinurus went,
Who late, star-gazing on their Libyan voyage,
Pitched from the stern had fallen amid the sea:
Whom, when at length the sorrowing face he knew
Through the thick gloom, he first addressed: “What
god,
O Palinurus, snatched thee from our sight,
And in mid ocean plunged thee? Tell me who:
For, ne’er till then found faithless, in this one
Presage Apollo fooled my mind, who sang
That scathless over sea thou shouldst arrive
Ausonia’s bounds. Is this his promised word?” 346

But he: “Nor Phoebus’ tripod failed thee aught,
My chief, Anchises’ son, nor any god
Plunged me in ocean: for behold! while I
Clave to the tiller, as my charge was, and steered,
Hurled headlong, I tore off, with mighty force,
And dragged it with me. By the rough waves I swear
No terror seized me for myself so much
As for thy ship, lest now, of tackle shorn,
Dashed from beneath her master, she should fall
Amid such mounting billows. Three wintry nights
Over the boundless ocean-plains the South
With fury drave me: scarce, the fourth dawn, high
On a wave’s crest I sighted Italy. 357
By inches I swam shoreward; safety now
Was in my grasp; had not the savage folk,
As heavy with soaked weed my fingers’ clutch
Caught at the rugged mountain-heads, with sword
Assailed and for a prize misdeemed me. Now
The wave holds, and winds toss me on the beach.
But by the pleasant light and air of heaven,
And by thy sire, I pray thee, by thy hopes
In young Iulus, pluck me from these ills,
O thou unconquered! Either, for thou canst,
Cast earth on me, reseeking Velia’s port,
Or, if there be a way, if any way
Thy goddess-mother show thee—for not all
Unwarranted of heaven, methinks, wouldst thou
Stem these vast waters, and the Stygian mere—
Grant to my tears thy hand, and bear me o’er
The billows with thee, that at least in death
I may find quiet resting.” Thus he spake,
And thus the prophetess began: “From whence,
O Palinurus, sprang this wild desire? 373
Shalt thou unburied view the Stygian waves,
And the stern river of the Eumenides,
Or tread the bank unbidden? Cease to hope
That heaven’s fixed doom can be unbent by prayer:
But, thy hard lot to solace, hear and heed:
For lo! the border townsfolk far and near,
Goaded by heavenly portents, shall appease
Thy dust, and build a tomb, and to the tomb
Pay yearly offerings; and the place shall bear
The name of Palinurus evermore.”
These words allayed his pain, and drove the grief
Awhile from his sad bosom; and he takes
Joy in the land that is to bear his name. 383

So they pursue the path, and near the stream.
But at that point, when from the Stygian wave
The boatman saw them through the silent wood
Moving, and striding toward the bank, he thus
Accosts them, and upbraids withal: “Whoe’er
Thou art, that to our river comest in arms,
Stand, and say why thou comest, and check thy step.
This is the place of shades, Sleep, slumberous Night;
The quick on Stygian barge I may not bear.
Nor was it to my joy that erst I took
And sped Alcides on the watery way,
Nor Theseus and Peirithous, albeit
Both god-begotten and of unconquered strength. 394
He the Tartarean warder sought to enchain
Before the king’s own throne, and cowering dragged;
These from the bride-chamber of Dis essayed
His queen to ravish.” Whereunto replied
Briefly the priestess of Amphrysus: “Here
Is no such trickery: cease to storm: these arms
Mean not offence: let the huge gatekeeper
With ceaseless baying scare the bloodless ghosts;
Guard Proserpine her uncle’s doors from stain:
Lo! here, renowned for goodness as for arms,
Trojan Aeneas to the nether shades
Of Erebus descends, to seek his sire. 403
If thee such goodness moves not to behold,
At least this bough”—the bough which lay within
Her robe disclosing—“canst thou not ignore.”
Then ebbed the swelling tide of his heart’s wrath,
Nor further spake he. At the awful gift
Wondering, the doom-wand, hid from sight so long,
He turns the dark-blue barge, and nears the shore.
Then other spirits, which on the long thwarts sat,
Thrust forth, he clears the benches, and on board
Takes vast Aeneas; groaned beneath his weight
The seamy craft, and through its chinks let in
The marsh-wave freely. Safe across the stream
Both prince and priestess he unships at last
On grey-green sedges and unsightly mire! 416
These are the realms huge Cerberus makes ring
With his three-throated baying—a monstrous bulk
Stretched in the cave’s mouth fronting them. To him,
Seeing his neck now bristling with its snakes,
A bait the priestess throws, with honey drugged
And medicated meal. His triple maw
With ravenous hunger opening, from her hand
He caught it, and, his monster-length relaxed,
Lies prone, spread huge o’er all the cavern-floor.
The warder sunk in sleep, Aeneas takes
The entrance, and quits swift the water’s rim,
Renavigable never. 425

Forthwith are heard
Voices of mighty wailing, and the cry
Of infant souls upon the threshold’s brink,
Whom, dowerless of sweet life, torn from the breast,
A dark day quelled and plunged in bitter death.
Next them were those by false charge doomed to die:
Not that their places without lot or judge
Are dealt them: Minos, as inquisitor,
Handles the urn, the silent council calls,
And learns the story of their lives and crimes.
And next have place the unhappy souls, who wrought
Their own end, guiltless, and flung life away,
Loathing the sunlight. Ah! how fain were these
Now in the upper air to bide both want
And hardship! Fate forbids: the unlovely swamp
Binds with its sullen wave, while pens them fast
Styx, with her ninefold barrier poured between. 435
Not far from hence, on every side outstretched,
Are shown the Mourning Fields: such name they bear.
Here, whom fell love with cruel wasting gnawed
Close walks conceal, and myrtle-groves embower:
Their pangs even death removes not. There he sees
Phaedra, and Procris, Eriphyle sad,
Showing the wounds her ruthless son had dealt,
Evadne, and Pasiphae, and with these
Laodamia, and once man, now maid,
Caeneus, by fate to his old shape restored.
And, among these, Phoenician Dido roamed,
Fresh from her wound, within the mighty grove:
Whom when the Trojan hero stood anigh,
And knew, though dim through darkness—as a man
Sees when the month is young, or thinks he sees,
The moon through clouds arising—the tears fell,
And with sweet words of love he greeted her: 455
“Unhappy Dido, was the tale then true,
Brought to mine ears, that thou wert quenched in
death,
And with the sword hadst sought the end of all?
Alas! was I thy doomsman? By the stars
I swear, and by the gods above, and by
Whate’er is sacred in the under-world,
Right loth, O queen, was I to quit thy shore.
But heaven’s decrees, which now to walk the shades,
Tracts rough with squalor, and abysmal night,
Compel, then drave me with their high behests:
Nor could I think that I should bring thee dole
So deep by my departure: stay thy step:
Withdraw not from my gaze: whom fliest thou?—this
Of all my greetings doomed to be the last!” 466
Aeneas with such words ’mid welling tears
Her fiery soul, fierce-glancing, sought to soothe.
She held her looks aloof, eyes fixed on earth,
And at his proffered speech changed face no more
Than hard flint stood she, or Marpesian rock.
At length she whirled away, and frowning sought
The green gloom, where Sychaeus her first lord
Echoes her grief, and gives her love for love.
Natheless Aeneas, stunned by her sad fate,
Follows with pitying tears her steps afar. 476
From hence he girds him to the appointed path.
And now the utmost fields they gain, where those
War-famous dwell apart. Here Tydeus, here
Parthenopaeus meets him, famed in arms,
And the pale spectre of Adrastus; here,

# The Aeneid VI

Much wept by those on earth, and fallen in war,
The Dardan chiefs, whom all in long array
He groaned beholding—Glaucus, Medon, there,
Thersilochus, Antenor’s children three,
And Polyphetes, Ceres’ priest, and, yet
Grasping the car, Idaeus, yet his arms. 485
Thronging, the souls press round him, right and left;
Nor does one look suffice them: still they love
To linger, pace beside him, and inquire
His cause of coming. But the Danaan lords,
And Agamemnon’s cohorts, when they spied
The hero’s armour gleaming through the shade,
Quake with vast fear: some, turning, fled, as erst
They sought the ships; some lift a meagre voice:
The would-be war-cry mocks their gaping mouths. 495
Aye, and the son of Priam here he saw,
Deiphobus—sore mangled all his frame,
Face and both hands rent cruelly, his ears
From the maimed temples shorn, and nostrils lopped
With shameful butchery. Nay, scarce knew he him,
Cowering and cloaking his rough chastisement,
Then in the oft-heard accents hailed him first:
“Deiphobus, thou warrior dread, and sprung
From Teucer’s lofty line, who listed, say,
To wreak such cruel vengeance, or who thus
Had power upon thee? To mine ears it came
On that last night of all, that, wearied out
With endless slaughter of Pelasgians, thou
Hadst on an heap of mingled carnage fallen. 504
Then I myself on the Rhoetean shore
Upreared an empty tomb, and with loud voice
Thrice called upon thy spirit: thy name and arms
Still mark the spot: thee, friend, I could not see,
Nor lay, ere parting, in our native earth.”
Whereto the son of Priam: “In naught hast thou
Failed me, O friend, but to Deiphobus
And to the dead man’s shade hast quitted all.
But fate and the pernicious guilt of that
Laconian woman plunged me in this woe:
These tokens are by her bequeathed. For how
That latest night in treacherous joys we spent
Thou knowest, must even remember all too well. 514
When o’er the lofty citadel of Troy
Leapt at a bound the doom-fraught horse, and bare
Armed soldiery within its labouring womb,
She feigned a solemn dance, and, leading round
The Phrygian dames with Bacchic revelling-cries,
Held in their midst herself a mighty torch,
And called the Danai from the fortress-height.
Then I with trouble spent, weighed down with sleep,
Was holden of our ill-starred bridal bower,
Lying with deep sweet slumber overwhelmed,
Deep as the calm of death. My peerless wife
Meanwhile all arms from out the palace moves—
The true sword first from’neath my pillow filched—
Calls Menelaus in, throws wide the door,
Hoping forsooth that to her lover this
Would prove a mighty boon, and so be quenched
The fame of old offenses. Why delay?
They burst into my chamber: joins their crew,
Prompter of crimes, the son of Aeolus.
Ye gods, like measure to the Greeks repay,
If with pure lips revenge I claim. But come,
Tell me in turn what chance brings hither thee,
A living man: by ocean-wanderings led,
Or at the hest of heaven? What fortune, say,
Spurs thee to seek the sad, unsunned abodes,
Regions of Chaos?” In this interchange
Of talk, Aurora in her rosy car
Had crossed the mid pole on her path through
heaven; 536
And haply all the allotted time they thus
Had wasted, but the Sibyl at his side
Spake a brief warning word: “Night comes apace,
Aeneas, and we with weeping wear the hours.
This is the spot where splits the road in twain:
The right leads to the giant walls of Dis,
Our way to *Elysium*: but the left wreaks doom
On sinners, and to guilty *Tartarus* sends.”
Deiphobus made answer: “Be not wroth,
Great priestess; I will hence, fill up the tale,
To darkness get me back. Our glory, go,
Go, entertain a happier fate.” Thus far
He spake, and, speaking, turned his steps away. 541

Aeneas looks swiftly back, and ’neath a rock
Sees leftward a wide fort, with triple wall
Girded: and round it a fierce torrent goes
Of billowy fire, Tartarean *Phlegethon*,
Who hurls the rocks in thunder: full in front
A vast gate, columns of solid adamant!
So that no might of man, nay, not the hosts
Of heaven avail to shatter it in war.
An iron tower stands skyward, where enthroned,
Girt with a gory robe, Tisiphone
Guards sleeplessly the threshold, night and day. 556
Hence groans are heard, and sound of cruel stripes
And clank of iron, and trailing chains. Aeneas
Stopped, and stood rooted, by the din dismayed.
“What shapes of crime are here, O maiden, say;
With what pains visited? What cry so swells
To heaven?” Then thus the prophetess began:
“Famed Teucrian leader, no pure foot may tread
The accursed floor: but Hecate herself,
What time she set me o’er the Avernian groves,
Taught me the punishments of heaven, and led
Through all its precincts. Here—an iron reign—
Rules Gnosian Rhadamanthus, of dark crimes
Both punisher and judge, from guilty lips
Extorting whatso’any upon earth,
Exulting in the empty cheat, hath left
Of sins inexpiate till the hour of death. 569
Straightway Tisiphone, armed with vengeful scourge,
Swinges and spurns the guilty, in her left
Brandishing snakes, and summoning the ranks
Of her fell sisters; then the awful gates
Open at last upon harsh-grinding hinge.
Seest thou what warder sits before the door?
What grim shape guards the threshold? But within,
Monster of fifty throats black-yawning, keeps
Ward a yet fiercer Hydra. Therewithal
Lo! *Tartarus*’ self, that opes sheer down, and strikes
Into the nether darkness, twice so far
As to Olympus’ skyey top and heaven
The eye scans upward. Here that ancient brood
Of earth, the Titan children, where the bolt
Felled them, lie wallowing in the deep abyss. 581
Here too beheld I, bodies of vast bulk,
The twin sons of Aloeus, who essayed
With rude hands to tear ope the mighty heaven,
And hurl Jove downward from his throne on high.
Aye, and I saw Salmoneus suffering still
The cruel doom that fell while aping yet
Jove’s fire and thunders of Olympus: he,
Drawn by four horses, and with waving torch,
Through the Greek tribes and ’midst of Elis town
In triumph rode and claimed the rank of gods,
Madman! the clouds’ incomparable bolt
With brass to mock and tramp of hoofed steeds! 591
But through thick clouds the Sire Omnipotent
Let loose a shaft—no brand or smoky glare
Of pine-torch he—that with its mighty wind
Down drave him headlong: there too Tityos,
Nursling of Earth, all-mother, might be seen,
Whose bulk o’er nine whole acres stretched, the while
A crook-beak’d monstrous vulture, gnawing still
The imperishable liver and entrails rife
With anguish, digs for dainties, housing deep
Within his bosom, and no respite gives
To the requickened fibres. Why tell o’er
The Lapithae, Ixion, Peirithous,
On whom a black crag, ever like to slip,
Frowns and seems falling? the high festal couch
Shines golden-propped; the feast before their eyes
Is spread with royal splendour; hard at hand
The eldest of the Furies, couched, forbids
Their fingers touch the board, and up she starts
With torch high-lifted and loud-thundering mouth. 609
Those who their brethren loathed while life endured,
Or smote a parent, or for client knit
The mesh of fraud, or over treasures found
Brooded alone, nor meted to their kin—
The mightiest number these—or who were slain
For loves adulterous, or to rebel arms
Clave, and feared not with masters to break faith,
Prisoned, await their doom. Seek not to learn
What doom, what phase or fate, hath whelmed them. Some
Roll a vast stone, or racked on wheel-spokes hang;
Sits hapless Theseus and for ay will sit;
And Phlegyas, wretchedest of men, warns all,
And with loud voice bears witness through the
shades: 619
‘Be taught, learn justice, and spurn not the gods!’
One sold for gain his country, on her neck
Planted a mighty tyrant, for a bribe
Made laws and unmade; one his daughter’s bed
Assailed, banned nuptials; all some monstrous guilt
Have dared, and of their daring reaped the joy.
Not though a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths
Were mine, a voice of iron, would these avail
To sum in gross and single all the crimes,
No, nor their penalties rehearse by name.” 627

So Phoebus’ aged priestess, and anon
“Up! seize the path, fulfil the attempted task,
Speed we our steps,” she cried; “I see the walls
Reared by the Cyclops’ forges, and the gate,
With arch confronting, where they bid us lay
The appointed tribute.” She had said, and through
Dim ways they, striding side by side, snatch up
The intervening space, and near the doors.
Aeneas then takes the entrance, on his limbs
Sprinkles fresh water, and makes fast the bough
Full in the gateway. This at last performed,
The goddess’ dues accomplished, they arrived
The happy region and green pleasaunces
Of the blest woodlands, the abode of joy. 639
An ampler ether with purpureal light
Clothes here the plain; another sun than ours,
And other stars they know. Some ply their limbs
Upon the grassy wrestling-ground, and strive
In sport, and grapple on the tawny sand;
Some, footing, beat the dance, and chant the lay.
Here too the Thracian priest, with trailing robe,
Makes eloquent the seven divided notes
To match their measures, and, with fingers now,
And now with comb of ivory, strikes them. Here
Are Teucer’s ancient stock, a glorious line,
The high-souled heroes born in happier years,
Ilus, Assaracus, and Dardanus,
Founder of Troy. He marvels to behold
Their arms and ghostly chariots from afar. 657
The spears stand fixed in earth; their steeds, unyoked,
Roam grazing o’er the plain. What pride had each,
Alive, in arms and chariot, or what pains
To pasture his sleek steeds, the same no less
Attends them still, now hid beneath the earth.
Lo! some he sees to right hand and to left
Feasting along the greensward, or in choir
Chanting a joyous paean, ’mid a grove
Of perfumed bay, whence risen Eridanus
Rolls wide through forests of the upper world.
Here is the band of those who suffered wounds,
Fighting for country, or, while life remained,
Were priests and pure, or holy bards that spake
Things worthy Phoebus, or who sweetened life
With new-found arts, earning by service wrought
Of some to be remembered—these are all
With snow-white fillet bound about the brow. 669
Whom, pouring round, the Sibyl thus addressed,
Musaeus before all, for midmost he
Of that vast multitude their upward gaze
O’ertops with towering shoulders: “Happy shades,
And thou, of bards the best, what region, say,
What haunt, now holds Anchises? For his sake
Have we come hither, and crossed the mighty floods
Of Erebus.” To her the hero thus
Brief answer made: “No fixed abode is here;
In shadowy groves we dwell, and make our home
The slope of banks, or freshet-quickened mead;
But, tends your heart’s wish thither, mount this ridge:
Soon will I set you on an easy track.”
He spake and strode before, and from above
Shows them the shining levels; then they quit
The mountain-summits. 678

Prince Anchises now
Deep in a green dell lay with busy thought
The souls there pent surveying, thence to pass
Up to the light of heaven, and, as it chanced,
Was telling o’er the tale of all his kin,
The well-loved offspring of his seed to be,
Their fates, their fortunes, characters, and deeds.
But when advancing towards him o’er the sward
He saw Aeneas, both eager palms he stretched,
And his cheeks ran with tears, and from his lips
This utterance fell: “And art thou come at last,
And has the love long looked for by thy sire
Conquered the toilsome road? May I behold
Thy face, my son, and hear the well-known voice
And answer? So indeed with pondering heart
I deemed that it would be, counting the days;
Nor did my longing cheat me. O’er what lands,
What vast seas, art thou borne to my embrace,
Tossed by what perils, O my son! What fears
Had I lest Libya’s realm should prove thy bane!”
But he: “It was thy mournful shade, my sire,
Aye thine, so oft appearing, drave me toward
These portals. Our ships ride the Tuscan main.
Give, father, give me thy right hand to clasp,
Nor from my arms withdraw thee.” Thus he spake,
Bathing his face, the while, with floods of tears.
Thrice, as he stood, his arms he sought to cast
About his neck; and thrice the baffled hands
Closed upon nothing, and a form that fled,
Like to light breezes, one with winged sleep. 702

Meanwhile Aeneas within the vale’s recess
Spies a sequestered grove, wood-whispering brakes,
And therewith *Lethe* river, that flows by
The dwellings of repose. Here, round about,
Nations and peoples without number flew;
Even as in cloudless summer, when the bees
Settling on meadow-flowers, now this, now that,
Stream o’er the milk-white lilies, all the plain
Hums with their buzzing. At the sudden sight
Aeneas starts, and witless asks the cause,
And what those floods afar, and who be they
That throng the banks in multitude so vast.
Then Prince Anchises: “Souls, to whom are owed
By fate new bodies; they by *Lethe*’s stream
Drink heedless draughts of long forgetfulness. 715
These to tell o’er and show thee face to face
Long have I yearned, and count my seed to be,
That thou the rather may’st my joy partake
In Italy new-found.” “And must we deem,
Some spirits, father, heavenward mount from hence,
And to their sluggish bodies back return?
Holds them so fond a longing for the light,
Unhappy souls?” “I will even tell thee, son,”
Replies Anchises, “nor prolong thy doubt,”
And all in order point by point reveals. 723
“Know first that heaven, the earth, the watery
plains,
The moon’s bright orb, and Titan’s starry sphere—
These doth a spirit inly feed; a mind,
Its limbs pervading, stirs the whole mass through,
And with the vast frame mingles. Hence arise
Mankind, and beastkind, winged life, and what
The sea bears monstrous ’neath his marble floor.
Of fiery vigour, heavenly source, those germs,
Save as impaired by flesh corruptible,
Dulled with frames earthy, and limbs prone to
death.
Hence they desire, and fear, and grieve, and joy.
Nor light of heaven can they discern, shut fast
In the blind darkness of their prison-house.
Nay, nor when life with its last beam departs,
Doth every ill, or all the body’s plagues,
Ah! hapless, leave them wholly; many a blot
Must, long ingrained there, cling in wondrous wise.
Therefore, by sorrow schooled, of their old ills
They pay the punishment: some hang exposed
To the void winds; some have the dye of guilt
Purged in vast whirlpool, or burnt out with fire.
Each his own weird we suffer—and then are sent
To range *Elysium*, and, some few, possess
Those happy fields—suffer, till lapse of time,
Now run full circle, shall eradicate
Each inbred blemish, and leave naught behind
But sense aethereal and pure spirit-fire.
These, having whirled a thousand years away,
Are in a vast throng summoned all by God
To *Lethe*’s stream, that, memory lost, they may
Heaven’s vault revisit, and a wish beget
Into the body to return once more.”

Anchises ceased, and drawing thence his son
And eke the Sibyl into the mid press
And murmuring throng, takes stand upon a mound
Whence in long line he might peruse them all,
Full face, and learn their features, as they came.
“Come now, the Dardan offspring, and their fame
Hereafter following, from Italian stock
What seed awaits thee, spirits of renown,
Heirs of our name, I will unfold in words,
Thy fortunes teach thee. Yonder, whom thou seest,
A youth, and leaning on a headless spear,
Nearest to light hath drawn a place; he first
From the mixed strain of Italy shall rise
Into the air of heaven, an Alban name,
Silvius, thy youngest offspring, whom, late-born,
Child of old age, thy wife Lavinia
Shall in the forest rear to be a king
And sire of kings, from whom our race shall rule
In Alba Longa. Procas next to him,
Glory of Trojan race, and Capys too,
And Numitor, and, second of thy name,
Silvius Aeneas, excellent alike
In goodness and in arms, if ever he
Come to his Alban kingdom. Lo! what men!
What might, see, in their bearing! and their brows
With civic oak o’ershadowed! These for thee
Nomentum, Gabii, and Fidenae’s town,
These towering Collatium on the hills shall rear,
Pometia, and the fort of Inuus,
Bola, and Cora. Those shall then be names,
Now nameless lands. Aye, and the son of Mars
Shall join him to his grandsire—Romulus,
Reared by his mother Ilia from thy blood,
Assaracus. Seest how the twin plumes stand
Upon his crest, and how his sire even now
By his own token marks him for a god? 780
Lo! ’neath his auspices yon glorious Rome
Shall bound, my son, her empire with the world,
Her pride with heaven, and with encircling wall
Clasp to her single heart the sevenfold hills,
Blest in a breed of heroes: even as when
The Berecyntian mother in her car
Rides through the Phrygian cities, turret-crowned,
Glad in her brood of godhead, as she clasps
A hundred children’s children, dwellers all
In heaven, and tenants of the heights above.
Both eyes turn hither now, this race behold,
Thine own, the Romans. Here is Caesar, here
The whole line of Iulus, that shall pass
One day beneath the mighty pole of heaven. 790
This, this the man so oft foretold to thee,
Caesar Augustus, a god’s son, who shall
The golden age rebuild through Latian fields
Once ruled by Saturn, and push far his sway
O’er Garamantians and the tribes of Ind,
A land that lies beyond the stars, beyond
The year’s path and the sun’s, where, prop of heaven,
Atlas upon his shoulder turns the pole,
Studded with burning constellations. See!
Even now, against his coming, Caspian realms
At the gods’ omens shudder; aye, and plains
Maeotic and the mouths of sevenfold Nile
Quake and are troubled. Not Alcides even
Traversed so much of earth, I trow, albeit
The brazen-footed hind he pierced, and stilled
The Erymanthian groves, and with his bow
Affrighted Lerna; nor who steers his car
With reins of vine-leaf, Liber, as he guides
From Nysa’s lofty crest his tiger-team. 807
And still by prowess to spread wide our power
Doubt we, and doth fear hinder us to tread
Ausonia’s land? But who is he afar
With olive-boughs conspicuous, in his hand
Vessels of sacrifice? I recognize
The locks and hoar beard of the Roman king,
Who shall the rising city base on law,
From lowly Cures and a land of need
Launched on a mighty empire. Next in turn
Comes Tullus, who shall break his country’s peace,
And stir ease-sunken warriors to the fray,
And ranks disused to triumphs; and hard on him
Ancus, o’erboastful, and too much even now
Caught by the breath of the vain multitude. 816
Wouldst see the Tarquin kings too, the proud soul
Of Brutus the avenger, and the rods
Of power retrieved? He first, with consul’s sway,
Shall the stern axes wield, and his own sons,
New strife upstirring, for fair freedom’s sake,
Bid to their doom, unhappy one! Howe’er
Censured in after time, his country’s love
And boundless thirst for honour shall prevail.
The Decii and the Drusi too behold
Far off, Torquatus cruel with his axe,
Camillus bringing home the standards. Those
Whom yonder glittering in like arms thou seest,
Of one heart now and while in darkness penned,
Let but their eyes attain the light, alas!
Each against each, what wars will they provoke,
What stricken fields and carnage! From the Alps’
Heaped barriers and Monoecus’ citadel
The sire descending, while his daughter’s lord
Confronts him with the armies of the East! 831
Make not a home within your hearts, my sons,
For strifes so cruel, nor the broad thews she bred
Bend at your country’s bosom. And thou first
Forbear, who from Olympus dost derive;
Fling from thine hand the weapons, O my blood!
He yonder to the Capitol on high
Shall drive his victor chariot, triumphing
O’er Corinth, for Achaean slaughter famed.
He Argos and Mycenae shall uproot,
City of Agamemnon, and the heir
Of Aeacus himself, from war-renowned
Achilles sprung, his ancestors of Troy
Avenging and Minerva’s outraged shrine. 840
Who thee, great Cato, would to silence leave,
Or thee, O Cossus? Who the Gracchan clan,
Or the two Scipios, thunderbolts of war,
The bane of Libya, or Fabricius
Puissant in poverty, or, Serranus, thee,
Sowing amid the furrow? I am spent,
And whither whirl ye me, O Fabii?
Thou art that Maximus, our mightiest, who
Alone by loitering dost the State restore.
Others the breathing brass shall softlier mould,
I doubt not, draw the lineaments of life
From marble, at the bar plead better, trace
With rod the courses of the sky, or tell
The rise of stars: remember, Roman, thou,
To rule the nations as their master: these
Thine arts shall be, to engraft the law of peace,
Forbear the conquered, and war down the proud.” 853
So Prince Anchises in their wondering ears
Spake, and yet further: “How Marcellus strides,
Look you, conspicuous with the splendid spoils,
Triumphant, and o’ertowering all men! he
Shall stay Rome’s empire, when invasion’s storm
Beats fiercely, ride the Carthaginian down,
Aye, and the rebel Gaul, and dedicate
To Sire Quirinus the thrice-taken spoils.”
And here Aeneas, for at his side he saw
A youth of peerless form in radiant arms
Pacing, but with unjoyful brow, and glance
Dejected: “Who is he, my sire, who thus
Attends the hero as he steps? A son,
Or later offspring of his mighty race? 865
What buzzing crowds about them! his own mould
How mighty! but black night around his head
With harsh gloom hovers.” Prince Anchises then
With brimming tears began: “Seek not, my son,
To know thy kin’s vast sorrow; him to earth
Fate shall but show, nor grant a longer stay.
Too potent in your eyes, O gods, had seemed
The Roman stock, were such gifts given to keep.
What wail of heroes shall that field of Mars
Waft to his mighty city! what funeral-train
Shalt thou behold, O Tiber, as thy stream
Flows by the new-made tomb! No boy e’er bred
Of Ilian race shall to such height of hope
Uplift his Latian sires, nor e’er the soil
Of Romulus so boast her of a son. 877
Mourn for his goodness, for his old-world faith,
His hand in war unconquered! Man to man,
None could have grappled him unscathed, on foot
Strode he against the foeman, or with spur
Goaded the red flanks of his foaming steed.
O boy, our sorrow, if any way thou couldst
Burst the harsh bonds that doom thee, thou shalt be
Marcellus. Bring me lilies with full hands,
The bright flowers let me strew, these gifts at least
Heap o’er his shade, and the vain tribute pay.” 885

So here and there, through the whole realm of mist,
In its broad fields they roam, surveying all.
And when Anchises had from end to end
Guided his son, and fired his soul with love
Of future fame, thereafter he makes known
What wars must next be waged, and teaches him
Of tribes Laurentian, and Latinus’ town,
And how to shun or suffer every toil. 892
There are twin gates of Sleep, whereof the one
Of horn is rumoured, and real spirits thereby
Win easy outlet; and one finished fair
Of gleaming ivory, but false dreams are thence
Sent by the *Manes* to the world above.
There with these words Anchises, following forth
His son and eke the Sibyl, sees them pass
Out at the ivory gate: the hero speeds
Fleetward, returning to his friends, then steers
Straight for Caieta’s port along the shore;
The prows drop anchor; the sterns press the beach. 901

## Book VII

Thou too, Caieta, dying, a deathless fame,
Nurse of Aeneas, to our shores hast given;
And still thy glory guards thy place of rest,
And the name marks, if such renown be aught,
Thy bones in great Hesperia. But, the rites
Of death paid duly, and a funeral mound
Reared, good Aeneas, now the deep was stilled,
Sails on his journey, and leaves port behind. 7
The gales breathe on into the night; the moon
White-orbed their course denies not; all the deep
Glitters beneath her quivering beam. From hence
Next skirted are the shores of Circe’s land,
Where the rich daughter of the Sun makes ring
With ceaseless singing her unfooted groves,
And in proud hall burns odorous cedar-wood
For light in darkness, with shrill-whirring comb
Crossing the subtle web. From hence are heard
The growls and wrath of lions, against their chains
Rebellious, roaring late into the night,
And bristly swine, and bears within their pens
Raging, and howling of huge wolfish forms,
Whom Circe, goddess fell, with drugs of power,
Stripped of man’s likeness, had arrayed in hides
And features bestial. Which so monstrous change
Lest the good Trojans suffer, into port
Once wafted, or draw nigh the dreadful shore,
With favouring breezes Neptune filled their sails,
Sped flying, and bore them past the seething shoals. 24

Now ’gan the sea with ruddy beams to blush,
And in high heaven the dawn on roseate car
Shone saffron-tinted, when down dropped the breeze,
And every breath of wind sank suddenly,
And on the slow smooth surface toil their oars.
Thereat Aeneas from out the deep descries
A mighty grove before him; cleaving it,
Lo! Tiber’s pleasant stream in hurrying swirls,
And yellow with much sand, bursts forth to sea.
Around, above, were birds of various plume,
Haunters of bank and river-bed, that charmed
The air with song, and fluttered through the grove.
He bids the crew shift course, and shoreward steer,
And, blithe of heart, enters the shady stream. 36

Now aid me, Erato; what kings had sway,
What exploits marked the time, how stood the weal
Of ancient Latium, when the outland host
First beached their galleys on Ausonia’s shore,
I will unfold, and of the opening strife
Recall the prelude. Do thou teach thy bard,
Thou goddess. I will tell of grisly wars,
Tell of embattled hosts, kings to their death
By fury driven, and the Tyrrhenian ranks,
And all Hesperia gathered under arms.
A mightier roll of exploit opens up
Before me, and a mightier task I try. 44
O’er fields and cities lulled in lasting peace
Reigned King Latinus yet, now full of years;
Son he to Faunus and Laurentum’s nymph
Marica, saith the legend. Faunus’ sire
Was Picus; from thy loins, O Saturn, he
Claims lineage; of his blood first founder thou.
Son and male heir the king had none, cut off
By doom of heaven in youth’s first dawn. His home
And stately palace one sole daughter kept,
Now ripe for husband, of full age to wed.
From Latium’s breadth, Ausonia’s utmost bounds,
Came many a wooer; before all who came,
Turnus the goodliest, mighty by descent
From sires and grandsires, whom as son to clasp
The royal consort yearned with keen desire:
But heaven with many a fearful sign forbad. 60
There was a laurel in the secluded depth
Midmost the palace-court, of sacred leaf,
And cherished many a year with awe, which King
Latinus, finding, as he laid, folk say,
The citadel’s foundation, had himself
To Phoebus dedicated, and from thence
Gave to his settlers their Laurentian name.
Upon its topmost point a cloud of bees,
Wondrous to tell, with mighty buzzing borne
Across the clear air, settled, foot with foot
Linked fast together, and from the leafy bough
Hung there, a sudden swarm. Forthwith the seer:
“A foreign hero I descry,” quoth he,
“Hither approaching, and a host that seek
The selfsame quarter by the selfsame way,
And lord it in the topmost citadel.”

# The Aeneid VII

Moreover, while the altar with pure torch
She kindles, and beside her father stands,
The maid Lavinia in her flowing locks,
O horror! seemed to catch the flame, and all
Her head-gear to let burn with crackling fire—
Ablaze her queenly tresses, and ablaze
The jewelled splendour of her coronal—
Till, wrapped in a dun glare of smoky light,
She spread the fire-god all the palace through.
Fearful in sooth and wondrous to behold
That sight was rumoured: for herself, they sang,
Should be renowned in fortune and in fame;
But to her folk it boded mighty war.
Vexed by such portents, to the oracle
Of Faunus, his prophetic sire, the king
Betakes him, and consults the grove 'neath high
Albunea, that, of woods the mightiest,
Rings with her haunted well, and through the gloom
Breathes forth a deadly vapour. Hence the tribes
Of Italy and all the Oenotrian land
In doubt seek answers. Hither when the priest
His gifts hath borne, on fleeces of slain sheep
Stretched him 'neath hush of night, and sought
repose,
Full many a phantom flitting he discerns
In wondrous wise, and divers voices hears,
Enjoys communion with the gods, and holds
Converse with Acheron in Avernus' depth.
Here King Latinus, too, himself then suing
For answers, with a hundred woolly sheep
Did sacrifice, and propped upon their hides
And outspread fells was lying, when suddenly
A voice gave utterance from the forest-depth:

> “Seek not in Latin wedlock to unite
> Thy daughter, O mine offspring, nor put faith
> In bridal bowers made ready; sons from far
> Approach, whose blood must bear our name to
> heaven.
> And whose posterity, where the circling sun
> Views either ocean, shall the whole world see
> Move 'neath their feet obedient.”

Such response
Of his sire Faunus, and such warning given
Beneath the hush of night, within his lips
Latinus locks not; but Fame flitting wide
Had through the Ausonian cities borne the tale,
When now the children of Laomedon
Made fast their galleys to the grassy bank.
Aeneas and his chief captains, with fair-faced
*Iulus*, stretch their limbs beneath the boughs
Of a tall tree, and set the banquet on,
And 'neath the viands along the sward lay cakes
Of sacrificial meal— great Jupiter
So bade them— and with country fruits pile high
The wheaten floor. All else, it chanced, consumed,
When, driven by lack of food, they turned to munch
The thin flour-fare, with hand and venturous teeth
Invade the circle of the fateful crust,
Nor from the out-pressed squares refrain them;

> “Ha!
> Eat we our tables too?”

*Iulus* cries
Jesting, and adds no more. That utterance heard
First set a term to trouble; and at once
Catching it, as it left the lip, his sire
Checked him, astounded at the sign from heaven.
Then,

> “Hail, O land, from destiny my due,
> And ye, Troy’s faithful hearth-gods,” he exclaimed,
> “Here is our home, and this our country; yea,
> My sire Anchises— I recall it now—
> Bequeathed me these dark words of destiny:
> ‘When wafted to an unknown shore, my son,
> Hunger compels thee, as food fails, to eat
> Thy tables, then remember, look to find
> A home, way-wearied; thy first dwellings then
> Found, and entrench them with a rampart.’ This,
> This was that hunger that till last remained,
> To mark destruction’s utmost. Wherefore come,
> Blithely explore we, with first ray of dawn,
> What is this place, or what folk dwell therein.
> And where the nation’s city, in divers ways
> Forth faring from the harbour. Now to Jove
> Bowls of libation pour ye, and with prayers
> Call on my sire Anchises, and set fresh
> The wine-cup on the board.”

So saying he binds
With leafy branch his temples, and adores
The Genius of the spot, and, first of gods,
Earth, and the nymphs and streams unknown as yet:
Then Night too, and the rising Signs of Night,
And Ida’s Jove invokes, and in due course
The Phrygian Mother, and his parents twain
In heaven and Erebus. Then from the height
The Almighty Sire thrice thundered clear, and shook
And from the sky with his own hand displayed
A cloud resplendent with bright shafts of gold.

Here through the Trojan ranks swift rumour spreads,
The day has come their destined walls to found.
Eagerly they renew the feast, and cheered
By the great sign from heaven, set on the bowls,
And crown the wine-cups. Soon as next day’s dawn
'Gan earth with light to sprinkle, scattering wide,
They explore the Nation’s city, bounds, and coast;
These are the waters of Numicius’ fount,
This Tiber stream; here the brave Latins dwell.
Then chose Anchises’ son from every rank
A hundred envoys, bidding them repair
To the king’s stately ramparts, all decked out
With boughs of Pallas, bear the hero gifts,
And for the Teucrians claim his clemency.
They tarry not, but at his bidding speed,
Borne with swift strides along. Himself marks out
The ramparts with low trench, prepares a site,
And the first dwelling camp-wise girds about
There on the shore, with battlements and mound.
And now the warriors, all their journey done,
Beheld the Latin towers and roofs arise,
And to the wall draw near. Before the town
Boys, see, and youths in manhood’s opening bloom,
Ply horsemanship, and tame amid the dust
Their chariot-teams, or stretch the eager bow,
Or the tough javelin hurl with strength of arm,
Or challenge to the race and boxing bout;
When, spurring forward, lo! a messenger,
Who to the aged monarch’s ear brings word
Of mighty men in uncouth garb at hand.
Into the palace he bids summon them,
And midmost sits on his ancestral throne.
The stately pile, gigantic, reared aloft
On hundred columns in the city’s top,
Once palace of Laurentian Picus, stood,
Awful with groves and olden sanctity.
Here 'twas auspicious that kings first receive
The sceptre, and uplift the rods of power.
This temple was their senate-house, and this
Their holy feast-hall: here the elders wont,
After ram slain, at the long boards to sit.
Aye, and the forms of their forefathers, ranged
A-row of ancient cedar, Italus,
Father Sabinus, planter of the vine,
In semblance holding still a curved hook,
And hoary-headed Saturn, and the shape
Of two-faced Janus, in the entry stood,
And other kings primaeval, and who else
Fighting for country had borne wounds in war.
And on the sacred doors great store of arms,
As captive chariots, curved axes, hung,
And helmet-crests, and massy bars of gates,
Javelins, and shields, and beaks from vessels torn.
Himself too, with Quirinal augur-staff,
And scanty toga girt, was seated there,
And in his left hand held the sacred shield,
Picus, of steeds the tamer, whom his bride
Circe, love-maddened, smote with golden rod,
With drugs transformed into a bird, and flecked
His wings with colours. Such the shrine wherein
Latinus, sitting on his father's seat,
Summoned the Teucrians to his presence-hall,
And hailed them, entered, with these words of peace:

> “O sons of Dardanus— for not to us
> Unknown your race and city, and we have heard
> Of your sea-faring hither— what seek ye? say
> What cause, what need, hath borne your barks so far
> O'er the blue billows to Ausonia’s strand?
> Whether track lost, or tempest-driven— such hap
> As sailors suffer oft on the high sea—
> Ye have passed between our river banks, and safe
> In haven ride, shun not our welcoming,
> And know the Latins are of Saturn’s seed,
> A race made righteous by no bond of law,
> But of their own free will refraining them,
> And by the fashion of their ancient god.
> And I indeed, though dim with years the tale,
> Still mind me of the Auruncan elders saying
> How from these fields sprang Dardanus, from hence
> To Phrygian Ida’s cities won his way,
> And Thracian Samos, now named Samothrace.
> Hence from the Tuscan house of Corythus
> Forth fared the hero: now upon a throne
> In the gold palace of the starry sky
> He sits, and swells the altar-roll of heaven.”

He spake, and Ilioneus took up the word:

> “King, peerless son of Faunus, nor wave driven
> Hath louring storm compelled us to your coast,
> Nor star or shore from the right course beguiled:
> Of purpose sail we all with willing hearts
> To this your city, outcasts from a realm,
> Erewhile the mightiest which the sun beheld
> In his far journey from the ends of heaven.
> From Jove our lineage springs; in Jove for sire
> Exult the Dardan youth; our king himself
> Is of Jove’s lofty line, Aeneas of Troy,
> Who to thy doors hath sent us. What wild storm,
> Poured forth from fierce Mycenae, swept the plains
> Of Ida, by what destinies impelled
> Europe met Asia, and world clashed with world,
> Even he hath heard whom earth’s remotest bound
> Withdraws by ocean’s baffled rim, or whom
> The zone of the sun’s fury, that lies stretched
> Midmost the four zones, severs from his kind.
> Forth from that deluge over the wide waste
> Of waters borne, we for our country’s gods
> Crave a scant home, a harmless gift of coast,
> And air and water, free alike to all.
> No blot upon your kingdom shall we be,
> Nor light your fame be bruited, nor the grace
> Of deed so noble perish; nor shall e'er
> Ausonia’s sons repent them to have clasped
> Troy to their bosom. By the fates I swear
> Of lord Aeneas, and by the strong right hand,
> Whether in troth or arms and battle tried:
> Full many a race and nation— scorn us not
> That we come proffering garlands in our hands
> And prayers upon our lips— have wooed and willed
> To knit us to themselves; but heaven’s decrees
> With their high mandate drave us to seek out
> No land but yours. From hence sprang Dardanus;
> Hither Apollo bids us back, and goads
> Toward Tuscan Tiber and the sacred pools
> Of fount Numicius with his high behests.
> Some slender offerings of his former state
> Beside he gives thee, from the flames of Troy
> A remnant rescued. With this gold his sire
> Anchises at the altar poured the wine:
> This was the gear of Priam, when, as wont,
> Unto the assembled nations he gave law—
> Sceptre, to wit, and sacred diadem,
> And robes, the handiwork of Ilian dames.”

As thus spake Ilioneus, Latinus held
His face set firmly in one downward stare,
And to the earth cleaves motionless, his eyes
Rolling intently. Nor doth broidered robe
Of purple, no, nor Priam's sceptre stir
The king so deeply, as in thought he broods
Upon his daughter’s bridal troth and bower,
And ponders in heart’s core the oracle
Of ancient Faunus. This then is the man,
That traveller from an outland home, and son
By fate predicted, summoned with like sway
To share his kingdom; he, whose race should prove
In valour peerless, destined by their might
To hold the universe in fee. At length
Joyful he cries:

> “Heaven prosper our intent,
> And its own presage! granted be thy suit,
> O Trojan! nor spurn I the gifts. While reigns
> Latinus, a rich land’s fertility
> Lack shall ye never, nor the wealth of Troy.
> Let but Aeneas, if his heart so yearn
> To us-ward, if for hospitable ties
> Impatient, and the name of fellowship,
> Himself draw near, nor shrink before the gaze
> Of friendly faces. Of my terms of peace
> This shall be part, your prince’s hand to press.
> Ye now in turn this message bear from me
> Back to your king. A maiden child have I,
> Whom with a lord of our own race to wed
> Nor oracles from out my father’s shrine
> Nor many a prodigy from heaven permits.
> Sons from an outland country are to come—
> So chant they Latium’s destiny— whose blood
> Must raise our name to heaven. That this is he
> By fate demanded I both deem, and, if
> My mind of truth aught presage, him adopt.”

So saying, the sire from out his whole array
Picks chosen steeds: three hundred stood there sleek
In lofty stalls: these bids he straight be led
Wing-footed forth, for every Teucrian one,
With purple and with broidered housings decked;
Droop to their chests gold necklets; trapped with
gold,
Red-gold the bits between their champing teeth;
But for Aeneas, for their absent king,
Car and twin coursers of celestial strain,
With nostrils snorting fire, sprung from the stock
Of those which subtle Circe to her sire
Raised, and by stealthy mating mixed the breed.
So dowered, so greeted by the king, Troy’s sons,
Towering on steed, hie homeward and bring peace.
But from Inachian Argos, as she came,
Lo! the fierce spouse of Jove her airy voyage
Was holding when, from heaven far off as lies
Sicilian Pachynus, she espied
Aeneas' rejoicings, and the Dardan fleet.
Even now she sees them building homes, even now,
Their barks abandoned, trusting to the shore.
Stabbed with sharp agony she stopped, and then,
Shaking her head, this heart-wrung utterance
poured:

> “Ah! loathed stock, ah! Phrygian destinies
> At odds with ours! upon Sigeum’s plain
> Say could they perish, or, when captive ta'en,
> Be captured? did the flames of Troy burn up
> Her warriors? through armed hosts, through fire, they
> have found
> An outlet. But my deity belike
> At length lies spent; or, surfeited with hate,
> I have turned me to my rest: nay, even when hurled
> From home and country, o'er the billows I
> Relentless spared not to pursue them still,
> And bar the exiles’ path on every main.
> Upon the Teucrians have been spent the powers
> Of sky and ocean. What did Syrtes, say,
> Or Scylla, or Charybdis’ weltering waste
> Avail me? In the Tiber’s wished-for bed
> They shroud them, careless of the main and me.
> Mars on the monstrous Lapithaean brood
> Could ruin wreak; the Sire of gods himself
> To Dian’s wrath old Calydon consigned—
> For what desert of sin so heinous doomed
> Or Lapithae or Calydon? But I,
> Jove’s mighty consort, who have deigned to leave
> Nothing undared— ah! wretched, to all shifts
> Have turned me— by Aeneas am subdued.
> Well, if my deity lack might enow,
> I’d spurn not to ask aid from whencesoe'er;
> If powerless to bend heaven, I’ll stir up hell.
> 'Twill not be mine to bar him from the throne
> Of Latium— be it so; and Lavinia stands
> Immutably his fate-appointed bride:
> Yet stay the hour, heap hindrances on hopes
> So mighty— this I may, and extirpate
> Of either prince the people: at such cost
> Of their own kin let son with sire unite!
> O maid, with Trojan and Rutulian blood
> Shalt thou be dowered, and for thy brideswoman
> Bellona waits thee. Nor did Cisseus’ child
> Alone of women travail with a brand,
> And bring forth nuptial fires; nay, Venus too
> Hath the like offspring— a new Paris— borne,
> A bale-torch to the towers of Troy re-risen.”

So saying, she dropped to earth, an awful form,
And from the dwelling of the sisters dread,
Even from the nether darkness, summons forth
Baneful Allecto, to whom dolorous wars,
Wraths, treacheries, and disastrous feuds, are dear.
Loathed even by Pluto, who begat her, loathed
By her own hellish sisters, is the pest;
So many her changing shapes, so fierce her forms,
So thick she bristles with black-sprouting snakes.
Her Juno thus with goading words bespoke:

> “Grant me this service, this thy proper task,
> O Night-born maiden, lest mine honour fail,
> Or fame fall shattered, and the sons of Troy
> With marriage-bonds be able to win o'er
> Latinus, or Italia’s bounds beset.
> Thou canst arm brothers of one mind for strife,
> With hate wreck houses, on the homes of men
> Fling scourge and funeral-torch; a thousand names
> To thee belong, a thousand arts of ill.
> Stir thy rife bosom, snap the cords of peace,
> Sow battle’s rancorous seed; let all at once
> Desire, demand, and clutch the tools of war.”

Forthwith Allecto, steeped in Gorgon-bane,
To Latium first repairs, and the proud halls
Of the Laurentian monarch, and besets
Amata’s silent bower, who, as she mused
Upon the coming of the Teucrian lords,
And Turnus’ bridal troth, was seething hot
With all a woman’s grief, a woman’s ire.
At her the goddess from her steely locks
A serpent hurls, and in her bosom plants
Hard by the heart; that, maddened with the pest,
She may the whole house in confusion whelm.
'Twixt robe and ivory bosom in it creeps,
Glides without touch, and maddens unaware,
Its vipery breath instilling: the great snake
Becomes the twisted gold about her throat,
Becomes the hanging head-band, wreathes her hair,
And o'er her body winds its slippery way.
Now, while the first contagion creeping in
With clammy poison penetrates her sense,
And wraps her bones in fire, ere yet the soul
Through all her bosom's depth had caught the flame,
Mildly she spoke, in mother's wonted wise,
Over her daughter shedding many a tear,
And at the Phrygian bridal:

> “Is it then
> To Teucrian exiles that Lavinia’s hand,
> Good father, must be given? Hast thou no touch
> Of pity for thy daughter and thyself?
> None for her mother, whom, with the first north
> wind,
> Yon faithless rover will leave desolate,
> Flying o'er ocean with his maiden-prey?
> Was it not thus the Phrygian shepherd thrid
> His way to Lacedaemon, and from thence
> Bore Leda’s Helen to the towns of Troy?
> What of thy plighted word? Where now the love
> Of old time for thy people, the right hand
> So oft to Turnus, to thy kinsman, given?
> If from a foreign race must needs be sought
> A son for Latium, and that purpose hold,
> And thy sire Faunus’ word upon thee weigh,
> Then I deem foreign every land self-ruled
> That from our sway lies severed, and that thus
> The gods declare it. Aye, for Turnus too,
> If back to its first fount his line be traced,
> From Inachas and sire Acrisius sprang,
> And mid Mycenae.”

When, with words like these
Making vain trial, she sees Latinus still
Withstand her, and the serpent’s raging bane
Deep in her very heart has sunk, and now
Pervades her wholly, then the unhappy queen,
Goaded by monstrous horrors, unrestrained
Storms, like a thing possessed, from end to end
Of the broad city. As at times a top
Scuds 'neath the twisted whip-cord, which boys drive
In a great circle round some empty hall,
Intent upon their sport; it, lash-impelled,
Careers in curved courses; o'er it gape
The silly youthful throng, and still admire
The whirling box-wood; their blows lend it life:
She at no tardier speed is onward borne
Through midst of cities and impetuous tribes.
Nay, to the forest, under feigned spell
Of Bacchic power, essaying mightier crime,
Launched on a mightier madness, forth she flies,
And hides her daughter on the wooded heights,
To rob the Teucrians of their bride, and stay
The nuptial torches, wildly clamouring

> “Evoe Bacchus!” shrieking “Thou alone
> All worthy of the maid, in that she wields
> For thee the pliant wand, thee celebrates
> In dances, trims the sacred lock for thee.”

The rumour flies, and lo! the matrons all,
A sudden frenzy kindling in their breasts,
The self-same passion at one moment drives
To seek new dwellings. They have left their homes,
Bared necks and tresses to the breeze; but some
With quivering shrieks fill heaven, and clad in skins
Bear wands of vine-wood. Midmost, all aglow,
Herself uplifts a blazing pine, and chants
The marriage-song of Turnus and her child,
Rolling a blood-shot eye, and sudden shouts
Fiercely:

> “Ho! Latian mothers, wheresoe’er,
> Hearken! If any kindness yet survive
> For poor Amata in your loving hearts,
> Pricks you compunction for a mother’s right,
> Loose from your locks the wreaths, take up with me
> The revel.”

So 'mid forest depths, amid
The wild beasts’ lonely covert, far and wide
With Bacchic goad Allecto drives the queen.
When the first rage seemed whetted to her will,
Latinus’ counsel to confusion turned,
And all his house, forthwith on murky wing
Floats the grim goddess to the city walls
Of the bold Rutule, which fair Danae
For her Acrisian settlers, as folk tell,
Founded, borne shoreward by the furious South.
By men of old the place was Ardea called;
And Ardea still her mighty name retains,
Though fallen in fortune. Here in his high halls
Turnus at murk midnight deep slumber drew.
Allecto doffs grim face and fury-form,
Shifts to an old wife’s semblance, and ploughs up
Her baleful brow with wrinkles: hoary locks
She dons and fillet, then, twining therewithal
An olive-sprig, takes shape as Calybe,
The priestess old of Juno and her shrine,
And with these words confronts the warrior’s sight:

> “Turnus, wilt suffer to see all thy toils
> Poured out in vain, the crown that is thine own
> Signed o'er to Dardan settlers? Lo! the king
> Denies thee bride alike and blood-bought dower;
> And for his throne is sought an outland heir.
> Go now, face thankless perils, jeers for pay;
> Go, tread the Etruscan armies down, protect
> With peace the Latins. Such the very words
> Saturn's almighty daughter, self-revealed,
> Bade utter in thine ear, when thou shouldst be
> Lapped in the hush of night. Uprouse thee then,
> And blithely bid thy warriors arm and march
> Forth from the gates to battle, and burn up
> These that have moored them in our river fair,
> The Phrygian captains and their painted keels.
> The mighty power of heaven commands it. Yea,
> Let King Latinus’ self, an he demur
> To yield thee bridal and his oath obey,
> Now taste and prove the power of Turnus armed.”

Then, jeering at the prophetess, thus oped
The youth his lips in answer:

> “Of a fleet
> Arrived in Tiber's water-way the tale
> Hath not escaped my hearing, as thou deem'st.
> Fashion me no such terrors: not of us
> Unmindful is queen Juno; but thyself
> Old age, good mother, quelled with slow decay,
> Of truth waxed barren, vexeth with vain cares,
> And fools thee, prophetess, 'mid warring kings
> With empty fear. Thy task it is to guard
> God's images and altars; wars and peace
> Leave men to manage, by whom wars are waged.”

Allecto at such words blazed out in wrath.
But in mid utterance a swift shudder seized
The warrior's limbs; his eyes grew stony-stiff;
So thick with myriad serpents hissed the fiend,
So vast her form expanded. Rolling then
Her fiery eyes, as he lay faltering there,
Searching what more to say, she spurned him back,
Reared from her locks twin serpents, cracked her
whips,
And with wild utterance added:

> “It is I,
> Look you, whom, quelled with slow decay, old age,
> Of truth waxed barren, fools 'mid warring kings
> With empty fear! Turn thee and look on these.
> From the dread Sisters’ dwelling am I come,
> And in my hand I carry wars and death.”

So saying, a torch she hurled at him, and fixed
The fire-brand all a-smoke with murky light
Deep in his breast. Vast terror brake his sleep,
And a sweat bursting forth bathed all his frame,
Body and bone. For arms he wildly shouts,
Ransacks for arms both couch and castle; then
Lust of the sword and frenzy of cruel war
Storm high within him, wrath to boot: as, when
With mighty roar a faggot-fire is heaped
Under a seething cauldron's sides, up-dance
With heat the waters; the pent flood within
Rages and reeks and surges high with foam;
Nor can the wave now hold itself; anon
Flies the dark vapour to the void. He then
Calls on his captains, outraging fair peace,
To march on King Latinus; bids all arms
Be ready, to compass Italy and thrust
The foeman from the land: himself for both,
Teucrian and Latin too, would sole suffice.
When thus he had said, called heaven to hear his
vows,
Rutule cheers Rutule eagerly to the fray:
One the rare charm of youth and beauty moves,
One his ancestral royalties, and one
His deed-renowned hand.
While Turnus thus
With breath of valour fills each Rutule breast,
Allecto hies on Stygian wing to seek
The Teucrians, marking, with a new device,
The spot where fair *Iulus* on the bank
Snares the wild quarry, or on foot pursues.
Here flings upon his hounds the maid of hell
A sudden fury, and with the well-known scent
Infects their nostrils for the stag's hot chase—
First source of ill, which set the rustic heart
Afire for war. A stag of matchless mould
There was, and spreading antlers, from its dam
Stolen and nourished up by Tyrrheus’ sons
And their sire Tyrrheus, of the royal herds
Ruler, and ranger of the wide domain.
Their sister Silvia with all tenderness
Had tamed it to obedience, and would deck
Its antlers and with pliant wreaths entwine,
Comb the wild thing, and in pure water lave.
Trained to her hand, and at the master’s board
Familiar, it would wander in the woods,
And of itself again, how late soe'er,
Home to the well-known threshold wend its way.
Now wandering wide, *Iulus’* ravening hounds
Amid their hunt aroused it, as down stream
It chanced to float, or on the grassy bank
The heat allayed. Ascanius, too, himself
Fired with the love of peerless praise, bent bow
And levelled shaft, nor swerved his hand for lack
Of a god guiding; and with loud whirr, driven
Through belly and through flank, the bolt sped
home.
But to the well-known roof for shelter fled
The stricken beast, into the homestead crept
Moaning, and, blood-bedabbled, with loud plaint,
As supplicating aid, filled all the house.
First sister Silvia, smiting hand on arm,
Cries out for help, and summons the stout hinds.
They, for within the silent forest yet
Lurks the fell pest, ere looked for, are at hand.
One with fire-hardened stake for weapon, one
With heavily knotted club: what every hand
First groping found, wrath makes a tool of war.
Tyrrheus, just cleaving, as it chanced, an oak
With wedges’ force split four-wise, gripped an axe,
And breathing out fierce rage, cheers on the band.
But from her watch-tower the grim goddess now,
Seizing the hour for mischief, to the stall’s
High roof repairs, and from its summit winds
A pastoral point of war, on wreathed horn
Straining the hellish note: from end to end
Shuddered the whole grove, and the forest-depths
Re-echoed: heard it Trivia’s lake afar,
Heard it Nar’s river, white with sulphurous wave,
And Velia’s springs; and mothers at the sound
Trembled, and clasped their children to their breasts.
Then, hurrying at the call, the signal-blast
By the dread trumpet given, from every side
The dauntless husbandmen snatch arms and rush
Together: nor less the Trojan youth pour forth
Aid for Ascanius through the open gates.
The ranks are set: no more in rustic strife
Is plied the knotty club or fire-seared stake;
Nay, but with two-edged steel they fight it out,
While the dark harvest bristles far and wide
With naked sword-blades, and the flash of brass
Sun-fretted darts its radiance to the clouds:
As, when a wave beneath the rising gale
'Gins whiten, the sea slowly heaves, and rears
Its billows higher, then from the lowest deep
Mounts in one mass to heaven. And hereupon
First of the foremost by a whizzing shaft
Young Almo is struck down, once eldest-born
Of Tyrrheus; for the wound within his throat
Lodged, and choked up the channel of moist speech
And the thin life with blood. Around him fell
Full many a warrior-form, and with them old
Galaesus, as for peace he interposed;
Erewhile of all men the most upright he,
And wealthiest in Ausonian soil. For him
Five bleating flocks, five herds, from pasture came,
And with a hundred ploughs he turned the sod.
While on a doubtful field so sways the fight,
The goddess, proved no weaker than her word,

Thus, having dipped the war in blood and opened
With death the onset, quits *Hesperia's* land,
Wheels through the skyway, and to *Juno* thus
Speaks in proud tone triumphant: “At thy suit
See discord ripened into dolorous war!
Bid them knit friendship or strike treaty now!
I, who have sprinkled with Ausonian blood
The *Teucrians*, will add this beside— so be
Thy will assured to me— draw neighboring towns
With rumors to the fray, and fire their hearts
With the mad war-god's lust, from far and near
To aid them. I will sow the land with arms.” 55

*Juno* replies: “Enough of fears and plots;
Firm stand the grounds of quarrel; in armed fight
Man grapples man; the weapons chance supplied
Reek with fresh blood today. Such nuptial rite,
Such bridal let them hold— the peerless seed
Of *Venus* and great *Latium's* king. That thou
With freer foot shouldst roam the air of heaven,
The mighty Sire, lord of *Olympus'* height,
Would suffer not; give place; what further toil
May happen, myself will cope with.” Such the words
*Saturnia* spake. But the other rears aloft
Her serpent-hissing pinions, quits the vault
Of heaven, and homeward to *Cocytus* hies. 562

There is a spot midmost of *Italy*
Beneath tall mountains, famous, and renowned
In many a land, Amsanctus' vale; 'tis hemmed
On this side and on that by wooded walls
Dark with dense foliage; and amidst it boils
And swirls among the rocks with broken roar
A torrent. Here is shown an awful cave,
Outlet of cruel *Dis*; and a vast chasm,
Where up bursts *Acheron*, opes its noisome jaws;
Thereinto plunged the Fury, loathed power,
And lightened earth and heaven. 571

Nor less meanwhile
Sets Queen *Saturnia* to the work of war
Her consummating hand. From field to town
Rush the whole shepherd-rout, bear home their slain—
Young Almo, and Galaesus' mangled face—
Conjure the gods, and on *Latinus* call.
*Turnus* is there, 'mid fierce death-kindled cries
Redoubling terror: “*Teucrians* called to reign—
A *Phrygian* shoot engrafted— he himself
Spurned from the door!” Then they, whose matrons still,
Blinded by *Bacchus*, foot the pathless groves
In dance— for mighty is *Amata's* name—
Muster from all sides, and importune war. 582

Straight, one and all, in spite of signs, in spite
Of dooms from heaven, by some thwart power beguiled,
Clamor for cursed strife. With emulous zeal
Round King *Latinus'* palace-gates they swarm.
He like an unmoved ocean-cliff withstands—
An ocean-cliff, which, when a great crash falls,
And multitudinous billows bark around,
Holds steadfast by sheer bulk: in vain the crags
And foamy rocks roar round it; and the weed,
Dashed on its bases, is washed idly back. 590

But when no power to quell their blind resolve
Is given, and at fierce *Juno's* beck goes all,
Then, heaven and the void air invoking oft,
“Ah! broken,” cried the sire, “by fate are we,
And driven before the tempest! Ye yourselves
Will with your impious blood atone for this,
Fond wretches! Thee, O *Turnus*, thee the crime
And its dread reckoning shall await; and thou
Wilt sue to heaven too late for prayers to aid.
My rest is won, and, hard on harbor's verge,
'Tis but a happy death I miss.” Therewith
He ceased to speak, within his palace doors
Immured him, and let go the reins of power. 600

There was a wonted rite in *Latium's* realm
*Hesperian*, holy held from age to age
By *Alba's* cities, as today by *Rome*,
Earth's mightiest, when they rouse the god of war
To battle, whether against *Getic* foes
Intent to launch amain the dolorous fray,
Or *Arabs*, or *Hyrcanians*, or to march
On *India's* sons, or track the morning star,
And from the *Parthian* their lost standards claim.
There are twin gates of War— so named and known—
By holy fear and terror of fell *Mars*
Made venerable: a hundred brazen bolts
Constrain them, and the eternal strength of iron,
Nor *Janus* on the threshold slacks his guard. 610

Here, be the fathers' will on battle bent,
The *Consul* in *Quirinal* robe arrayed
And *Gabine* cincture, the harsh-grinding valves
Himself unbars, himself invokes the fray,
Then all the war-host follow, and with one throat
The brazen clarions blare their hoarse assent.
Now too on this wise was *Latinus* bidden
War to proclaim against the sons of *Troy*,
Unclose the sullen portals. From their touch
The sire recoiled, turned from the loathed task
Shrinking, and shrouded him in eyeless gloom.
Then, gliding from on high, the queen of heaven
With her own hand the lingering portals pushed,
And *Saturn's* daughter upon back-swung hinge
Asunder burst the iron-bound gates of war. 622

*Ausonia*, erst supine, immovable,
Anon takes fire. Some gird them o'er the plain
To march afoot; some, mounted on tall steeds,
Storm through a cloud of dust; all shout for arms.
Some furbish with rich lard the buckler smooth,
The javelin bright, or on the whetstone wear
Their axes to an edge: with joy they thrill
To advance the standard, hear the trumpet bray. 628

Five mighty cities set their anvils up
To fashion arms anew— *Atina* strong,
Proud *Tibur*, *Ardea*, and *Crustumeri*,
And turret-crowned *Antemnae*. For headgear
Helmets they hollow, and for the boss of shields
Bend wicker-plait; some corslets beat from brass,
Smooth greaves from pliant silver. Even to this
The pride of share and hook, to this hath fallen
All passion for the plough: their fathers' swords
I' the furnace they re-temper. And now sounds
The clarion, speeds the watchword for the war.
One in hot haste plucks helm from house-wall; one
Couples his snorting coursers to the yoke,
In shield and hauberk triple-twilled with gold
Arrays him, and girds trusty sword on thigh. 640

Now, *Muses*, ope the gates of *Helicon*
And wake the song— what kings were roused to war.
What hosts behind them following filled the plain;
Bloomed with what heroes, with what armor burned,
Even then the nursing soil of *Italy*:
For, being maids immortal, ye both mind
And can recount them: scarcely to our ears
Floats through the ages a thin breath of fame.
First to the field, despiser of the gods,
Speeds fierce *Mezentius* from the *Tyrrhene* coast,
And arms his ranks for battle; hard by him
*Lausus* his son, than whom no goodlier man,
Save *Turnus* of *Laurentum*. At his back
*Lausus*, steed-tamer, beast-destroyer, leads
His thousand from *Agylla's* town— in vain;
Worthy of happier service as a son,
And other than *Mezentius* for his sire. 651

Behind them on the grassy sward displays
His palm-crowned chariot and victorious steeds
A hero, sprung from *Hercules* the fair,
Fair *Aventinus*: on his shield he bears
A hundred serpents, his ancestral sign,
The snake-encircled *Hydra*. Him by stealth
The priestess *Rhea* on wood-clothed *Aventine*,
Woman with god commingling, bare to light,
When the *Tirynthian* victor, *Geryon* quelled,
Arrived the *Laurentian* fields, and there bathed
His kine *Iberian* in the *Tuscan* stream.
Javelins and cruel pikes they wield for war,
And with smooth-polished dart *Sabellian* fight.
Himself, swinging a lion's monstrous fell
Shaggy with fearful bristles, o'er his head
Flung with its flashing teeth, thus strode on foot
Into the palace, grisly-rough, the garb
Of *Hercules* about his shoulders clasped. 669

Then brethren twain from *Tibur's* hold, a folk
Called from their brother's name *Tiburtus*, come,
*Catillus* and keen *Coras*, *Argive* youths.
First of the foremost, on they press, where darts
Throng thickest: as when from some tall mountain-top
Descend two cloud-born *Centaurs*, *Homole*
Or snow-capped *Othrys* quitting with swift stride;
The mighty forest as they go gives place,
And with loud crash the thickets yield them way. 677

Nor lacked the founder of *Praeneste's* town,
King sprung from *Vulcan* 'mid the pasturing herds,
And by the fireside found, as every age
Hath deemed him— *Caeculus*. A rustic band
Spread wide attends him, those that dwell on steep
*Praeneste's* height, or *Gabian Juno's* fields,
Chill *Anio*, or the stream-dewed *Hernic* rocks;
Whom rich *Anagnia* nurtures, or whom thou,
Sire *Amasenus*. Arms they have not all,
Nor shield, nor sounding chariot. The more part
Sling bullets of blue lead. Some javelins twain
Brandish in hand, with tawny wolfskin cap
For headgear: the left foot bare-soled they plant;
The other a raw bull's-hide sandal sheathes. 690

*Messapus*, the steed-tamer, *Neptune's* child,
Whom none with fire, nor yet with steel, may quell,
Tribes long inert and ranks to battle strange
Calls suddenly to arms, grasps sword once more.
These have *Fescennine* warriors in their host,
And *Aequi* of *Falerium*; these hold high
*Soracte* and *Flavinian* fields, the lake
And hill of *Ciminus*, and *Capena's* groves.
In measured time they march and chant their king:
As snow-white swans that, through the liquid clouds
From food returning, utter forth their full
Long-throated strains. The stream and *Asia's* fen
Afar ring smitten. Nor had one deemed them there
A mail-clad army blent in vast array,
But rather of hoarse birds an airy cloud,
That from the deep mid-ocean shoreward ply. 705

Lo! *Clausus* of old *Sabine* blood, who leads
A mighty host, himself a host in might!
From whom the *Claudian* tribe and clan today,
Since *Rome* was with the *Sabine* shared, spreads wide
Through *Latium*: and along with them the vast
Cohort of *Amiternum* and old-world
*Quirites*, all *Eretum's* folk, and they
Of olive-rife *Mutusca*; men who throng
*Nomentum's* city and the *Rosean* plain
Hard by *Velinus*; who the rugged rocks
Of *Tetrica*, and mount *Severus* hold,
*Casperia's* town, and *Foruli*, and where flows
*Himella's* stream; who drink of *Tiber's* wave
And *Fabaris*, or whom chilly *Nursia* sends,
With *Horta's* squadrons and the *Latian* tribes,
And they whom *Allia*, evil-boding name,
Parts with dividing current: numberless
As billows that on *Libya's* sea-door roll,
When fierce *Orion* sets in wintry wave,
Or thick as clustering corn-ears, that beneath
The young sun ripen, or on *Hermus'* plain,
Or *Lycia's* yellowing fields. Their bucklers clang,
And the earth quakes for terror as they tread. 722

*Halaesus* next, of *Agamemnon's* stock,
Foe to the name of *Troy*, yokes steed to car,
And whirls a thousand warlike tribes along
To fight for *Turnus*, men who till with hoe
The wine-blest *Massic* region, or sent forth
From their high hills by the *Auruncan* sires,
Or *Sidicine* low-dwellers hard at hand;
Comers from *Cales*, and who dwell beside
*Volturnus'* shoaly river, and with these
The rough *Saticulan*, and the *Oscan* band;
Smooth-polished clubs for missiles, 'tis their wont
With a tough thong to fit them; the left arm
A leathern target shields; curved swords they bear
For close encounter. 732

Nor must thou depart
Unhonored of our song, O *Oebalus*,
Whom, as folk tell, the nymph *Sebethis* bare
To *Telon*, when now full of years he ruled
The *Teleboic* realm of *Capreae*.
But, with his sire's domain waxed ill-content,
Even then the son was curbing 'neath his sway
The wide *Sarrastian* peoples, and the plains
By *Sarnus* washed, folk that in *Rufrae* dwell
And *Batulum* and *Celemna's* furrowed fields,
And those on whom the battlements look down
Of apple-boughed *Abella*. These were wont
In Teuton-wise long darts to hurl amain:
Peeled cork-tree bark for headgear, their slight shields
Are glittering brass, and glittering brass their swords. 743

And thee too, *Ufens*, from her mountain-perch
*Nersae* sent forth to battle, fame-renowned,
And fortunate in war, whose *Aequian* folk
On their stiff clods are rugged beyond all,
And to hard hunting in the woods inured.
In arms they task the furrow, and evermore
Amass new plunder, and by rapine live. 749

Aye, and a priest of race *Marruvian* came,
His head with garland of rich olive dight,
By King *Archippus* sent, *Umbro* the brave,
Who on the viper's brood and water-snakes
Of baneful breath, with charm of voice and touch
Shed slumber, and assuaged their wrath, his craft
Their bites allaying. But stroke of *Dardan* spear
To heal he skilled not, nor his slumbrous charms
Availed against their wounds, nor herbs with care
Culled on the *Marsian* mountains. Wept for thee
*Anguitia's* grove, for thee the glassy wave
Of *Fucinus*, the crystal pools for thee. 760

There *Virbius* to the war in beauty strode,
Son of *Hippolytus*, whom in flower of fame
His mother sent, *Aricia*; nursed he was
In groves *Egerian* round the humid shores,
Where *Dian's* rich and gracious altar stands.
Aye, for *Hippolytus*, so runs the tale,
By stepdame's treachery done to death, and torn
By his scared steeds, to glut a sire's revenge,
Returned to daylight and the air of heaven,
Called by the *Healer's* herbs and *Dian's* love. 769

Then, wroth that mortal should from shades of hell
Rise to the light of life, the Almighty Sire
With his own levin-bolt to *Stygian* wave
Thrust down the finder of such craft and cure,
The *Phoebus*-born. But *Trivia* of her grace
In a dim dwelling hides *Hippolytus*,
To nymph *Egeria* and her grove consigned,
Alone, obscure, in woods of *Italy*
With altered name, as *Virbius*, to live on.
Whence too, from *Trivia's* shrine and hallowed groves
Horn-hoofed steeds are banished, for that they,
Frighted by ocean-monsters, on the shore
Flung car and warrior. But the son no less
His fiery steeds along the level plain
Was driving, and rushed charioted to war. 782

Himself too *Turnus*, of surpassing mold,
Amid the foremost moving, arms in hand,
By a whole head overtops them; his proud helm,
Tressed with a triple plume, *Chimaera* bears,
Out-breathing from her jaws *Aetnean* fires,
The madlier raging with more baleful flames
As deeper the red field with carnage ran.
But his smooth shield *Io* with lifted horns
In gold emblazoned, now with hair o'ergrown,
Now turned to heifer, a stupendous sign,
And *Argus*, the maid's warder, and therewith,
His flood out-pouring from a graven urn,
Sire *Inachus*. Behind the hero comes
A cloud of footmen, and o'er all the plain
The shielded ranks are thickening, *Argive* men;
The *Auruncan* musters with the *Rutule* ranks;
And old *Sicani*, the *Sacranian* host
And gay-shielded *Labici*; who thy lawns,
O *Tiber*, and *Numicius'* sacred shore
Till, or with ploughshare tame the *Rutule* heights
And *Circe's* ridge; over whose fields enthroned
Rules *Jove* of *Anxur*, and *Feronia* sits
Rejoicing in her greenwood; where out-stretched
Lies the black marsh of *Satura*, and where
Along the valley-bottoms winds his way
Cold *Ufens*, till he plunges in the deep. 802

To crown them comes *Camilla*, Volscian-bred,
Heading her horse-troop, squadrons bright with brass,
A warrior-maid, her woman's hands unused
To loom or basket of *Minerva's* wool,
But strong to bide the battle, and on foot
Outrace the breezes: she might even have sped
Over the unlopped harvest-blades, nor bruised
The tender ears in running, or have skimmed
Mid-ocean, poised upon the billow's swell,
Nor in the surges dipped her flying feet.
At her, astonished, youths and maidens all
From house and field throng gazing, as she goes,
Agape with wonder at the royal pomp
Of purple draped about her shoulders smooth,
Her tresses intertwined with clasp of gold,
To mark the *Lycian* quiver that she bears,
And pastoral wand of myrtle tipped with steel. 817

## BOOK VIII

When *Turnus* from his citadel flung out
The flag of war, and hoarse the clarions blared,
When his bold steeds he roused, and clashed his arms,
Straight every heart is stirred; all *Latium* thrills,
Leagued in one wild uprising, and her sons
Rage madly. From all sides the warrior chiefs,
*Messapus*, *Ufens*, and *Mezentius*
The god-despiser, call their musters in,
And strip the wide fields of their husbandmen.
Then to the city of great *Diomede*,
To sue for succor, *Venulus* is sent
With tidings of a *Teucrian* host afoot
In *Latium*; that *Aeneas*, to their shores
Fleet-wafted, with his vanquished household gods
Invades them, claims to be their destined king;
That to the *Dardan* lord cleaves many a tribe,
And louder and more loud through *Latium's* breadth
His name is rumored: what he builds on these
Beginnings, to what outcome of the fray,
Should fortune follow at his back, aspires—
This must to *Diomede* more plain appear
Than to King *Turnus*, or the *Latin* king.
So sets the tide through *Latium*. But the prince,
*Laomedon's* great son, beholding all,
Is rocked upon a mighty sea of cares;
Hither and thither his swift mind he parts,
Speeds it all ways, and sweeps the round of thought:
As when from water in a brazen vat
A flickering beam, shot by the mirrored sun
Or bright moon's image, flits from side to side
O'er all things, and at last up-mounting strikes
The fretted ceiling of the roof on high.
'Twas night, and weary creatures, the world o'er,
Both bird and cattle-kind, deep slumber held;
When Prince *Aeneas* on the bank beneath
Heaven's chilly vault, and by the dolorous war
Heart-troubled, stretched him, and let sleep at last
Steal o'er his limbs. To him appeared the god
Of that fair spot, he of the pleasant stream,
Old *Tiber*, rising 'mid his poplar-leaves;
Veiled in a grey-green mantle of fine lawn,
With shadowy reeds about his locks, he thus
In words addressed him, and his grief allayed: 55

“O heaven-descended, thou who bring'st us back
*Troy's* city from the foeman, and preserv'st
Her towers forever, on *Laurentum's* soil
And *Latium's* fields long-looked for, here for thee
Waits a sure dwelling— draw not back— and sure
*Penates*: nor be scared by threats of war:
All the gods' swelling anger has died out;
And now, lest these things to thine eyes appear
A dream's vain figment, thou shalt find anon,
Under the holm-oaks on the margin laid,
A mighty sow, with thirty head of swine
New-littered, white, stretched out along the ground,
White young about her udders; sign whereby
*Ascanius* in thrice ten returning years
Shall *Alba* found, of glorious name: I chant
No doubtful doom. Now, mark, the present need
How to dispatch and triumph o'er, in brief
Will I discover. *Arcadians* on this coast,
A race derived from *Pallas*, in the train
Of King *Evander* following, have a site
Chosen, and built a city on the hills,
From their sire *Pallas* *Pallanteum* called. 76

These with the *Latins* wage perpetual war;
These welcome to thy tents, and knit with bonds
Of friendship. I myself betwixt the banks
And straight up stream will lead thee, that thou may'st
The adverse current conquer, oar-impelled.
Up, goddess-born! and with first set of star
Do homage meet to *Juno*, and disarm
With suppliant vows her wrath, her threats; to me
Thou shalt pay conqueror's tribute. Lo! 'tis I,
Whom grazing here the banks with brimming flood,
And cleaving the rich cornland thou behold'st,
Blue *Tiber*, river best-beloved of heaven. 94

Here doth my watery mansion outlet find,
Life-source of lofty cities.” Having said,
Into his deep pool plunged the river-god,
Seeking the bottom. Night and slumber left
*Aeneas*: he rises, and the Orient beam
Marks of the sun in heaven, then from the flood
Takes duly in the hollow of his hands
Water, and holds it, and pours forth to heaven
Such words as these: “O *Nymphs*, *Laurentian Nymphs*,
Whence rivers have their being, and thou too,
O Father *Tiber*, with thy hallowed flood,
Take to your care *Aeneas* and at length
From perils fend him. Whencesoever be fed
The pool that holds thee, pitier of our woes,
Wherever thou hast thy glorious outgoing,
Ever with offering, evermore with gifts,
By me shalt thou be graced, the horned flood,
Lord of *Hesperian* waters. Only grant
Thy presence, and with nearer token seal
The heavenly utterance.” Thus he spake, and chose
From out his fleet twin biremes, fits their decks
With oarsmen, and equips with arms the crew. 80

But lo! a sudden portent strange to see!
White, of one color with her milk-white young,
Along the wood, on the green bank lay stretched
A sow, conspicuous; which to thee, to thee,
O mightiest *Juno*, good *Aeneas* slays
In sacrifice, and at the altar sets,
With all her offspring. Through that livelong night
*Tiber* his swelling stream assuaged, and so,
With refluent effort halting, hushed his tide,
That, like still pool or quiet mere, he spread
A watery plain, whereon the oar might lack
All labor. So with favoring shout they speed
Upon the voyage begun: the tarred pine slides
Along the surface: wonder holds the waves,
Wonder the unaccustomed grove, to see
The shields of warriors gleaming bright afar,
And the gay vessels gliding on the stream.
They with their rowing wear out night and day,
Pass the long bends, are roofed with divers trees,
And cleave green forests on the glassy flood.
The fiery sun to heaven's mid cope had climbed,
When walls and citadel afar they spy,
And scattered house-roofs, which *Rome's* power today
Has matched with heaven, then but the needy realm
Swayed by *Evander*. Shoreward speedily
They turn their prows, and to the town draw nigh. 101

It chanced that day the *Arcadian* monarch paid
Due honor to *Amphitryon's* mighty son
And the high gods, within a grove that faced
The city. His son *Pallas*, hard at hand,
With all the chiefs and simple senate, brought
Incense, and warm blood at the altar smoked.
Soon, as they saw the lofty ships glide in,
Through the dark grove, and rest on silent oars,
Scared at the sudden vision, all leap up
And quit the board. But *Pallas*, undismayed,
Forbids break off the banquet, grasps a spear,
Speeds toward them, and from a far hillock cries:
“Warriors, what cause to try an unknown path
Constrains you? Whither fare ye? Of what race?
Sprung from what home? and bring ye peace or war?” 117
Then Prince *Aeneas* from the lofty stern
Speaks, in his hand a peaceful olive-branch
Out-stretching: “These are *Trojans* whom ye see;
Darts deadly but to *Latins*, who have spurned
And forced us into flight with wanton war.
We seek *Evander*: bear this message back,
And say the flower of *Dardan* chiefs are come
Craving an armed alliance.” At the sound
Of that great name *Pallas* stood thunderstruck:
“Whoe'er thou art, descend, and with my sire
Speak face to face, and enter the abode
Of hospitable hearth-gods.” So, with grasp
Of welcome, to the chief's right hand he clave:
Forth through the grove they fare, and quit the stream. 125

Then courteously *Aeneas* hails the king:
“Best of the sons of *Greece*, to whom I pray—
So wills it *Fortune*— and come proffering boughs
With fillet decked, I feared not for that thou
A *Danaan* leader art, Arcadian-born,
And from the twin *Atridae's* stem derived;
But my own worth, high auguries from heaven,
And our ancestral kinship, and thy fame
Spread through the world, have knit me to thy side,
And led me fain along the path of fate.
*Dardanus*, father of our *Ilian* town
And founder, to the *Teucrians* came of old,
Sprung from *Electra* the *Atlantid*, so
Greek legend saith; *Electra* was begot
Of mightiest *Atlas*, who up-shouldering bears
The orbs of heaven. Your sire is *Mercury*,
Whom *Maia* fair on chill *Cyllene's* top
Conceived and bore; but *Maia*, if tales heard
Win credence, from the selfsame *Atlas* sprung,
*Atlas*, who holds aloft the starry heaven:
So branches from one blood the line of both. 152

On this relying, no embassage I planned,
No artful first approaches: me myself,
Yea mine own person, have I brought, and come
A suppliant to your doors. The selfsame race,
The *Daunian*, persecutes ourselves, as thee,
With cruel warfare: if they drive us forth,
'Twere all as one, think they, beneath their yoke
To thrust *Hesperia* wholly, and possess
Both seas that wash her shores, above, below. 157

Take and return our friendship; we have hearts
Valiant for war, high courage, and a youth
In action tried.” *Aeneas* ceased. The king
Long since the speaker's countenance and eyes
And his whole frame was scanning; then he makes
Brief answer: “Bravest of the sons of *Troy*,
Thus to receive, to recognize thee thus,
How fain am I! How I recall the words,
The voice, the features of thy sire, the great
*Anchises*! for I mind how *Priam* once,
Son of *Laomedon*, when he came to view
The realm of *Hesione* his sister, bound
For *Salamis*, passed thence and visited
*Arcadia's* chill borders. In those days
The down of early manhood clothed my cheeks;
And I admired the *Teucrian* lords, admired
*Laomedon's* great son, but high o'er all
*Anchises* towering. With youthful zeal I burned
To accost the hero, and clasp hand to hand. 167

Approaching, eagerly his steps I led
To *Pheneus'* city. He, departing thence,
A glorious quiver gave me, *Lycian* shafts,
A gold-embroidered scarf, and bridles twain
All golden, which my *Pallas* owns today.
Therefore the hand ye seek is joined with yours
In treaty, and when first tomorrow's dawn
Shall earth revisit, I will send you hence,
Glad of our succor, and with stores supply.
Meanwhile, since hither as my friends ye come,
This yearly rite, which to defer were sin,
Keep with us, of your grace, and learn even now
To grow familiar at your comrade's board.” 177

So saying, the viands and wine-cup, erst removed,
He bids set on afresh, with his own hand
Ranges the heroes on a grassy couch,
To a heaped cushion of rough lion's fell
Welcomes *Aeneas*, as most honored guest,
And entertains him on a maple throne.
Then those appointed, with the altar-priest,
In emulous service bring roast flesh of steers,
Pile upon baskets *Ceres'* hand-wrought boon,
And serve the wine-cup. There *Aeneas* feasts,
With him the *Trojans*, upon long bull's chine
And sacrificial morsels. When at length
Hunger was ousted, lust of food appeased,
Spake King *Evander*: “These our solemn rites,
This wonted feast, this altar so divine,
No idle superstition, that knows not
The gods of old, hath ordered; as men saved
From deadly perils, O my *Trojan* guest,
These offerings pay we, and of right renew. 189

First look upon yon cliff-hung crag, and how
Huge blocks afar lie scattered, and void stands
The mountain-dwelling! Of down-tumbled rocks
How vast the havoc! Here was once a cave,
Deep-yawning inward, where, terrific shape,
Half-human *Cacus* dwelt, to the sun's rays
Impenetrable; and evermore the ground
Reeked with fresh blood, and to its tyrannous doors
Hung nailed men's faces, blanched with grim decay.
This monster's sire was *Vulcan*; his the flames
Dark-issuing from his mouth, as on he strode
In bulk gigantic. To us also time
Brought in due course, at our desire, the aid
And advent of a god. For hard at hand
*Alcides*, mightiest of avengers, stood,
Now glorying in the slaughter and the spoils
Of triple *Geryon*, as this way he drove
His giant bulls, triumphant, while the kine
Filled vale and riverside. But *Cacus* now,
In a brute-frenzy, not to leave undared
Or unattempted aught of crime or guile,
Four bulls of peerless beauty stole from stall,
With heifers of surpassing mold to match. 208

These by the tail, no forward track to leave,
Into his cavern, with back-pointing steps,
He haled, and hid them in the gloomy rock:
No footprint led the seeker to the cave.
Meanwhile, when his full herds *Amphitryon's* son
Would from their pasture shift, at point to go,
Bellowed the parting oxen; all the grove
O'erflows with their complaining, and the hills 214

# THE AENEID VIII

Are clamorously forsaken. To that cry
One of the heifers from the cave’s vast depth
Lowed in response, and from her prison foiled
The hope of Cacus. In Alcides’ heart
Black-venomed wrath straight into fury blazed.
Seizing his arms and heavily-knotted club,
Full speed he hies him up the skyey steep.
Then first our folk beheld Cacus afeard,
And trouble in his eyes: away he speeds
Swifter than Eurus, his feet winged with fear,
And seeks the cave: soon as, shut fast within,
He had burst the chains, and let the vast rock fall,
Which hung there by his father’s art and iron—
Propped firm and barricaded thus the door,
Lo! he of Tiryns, in a frenzy of wrath,
Was close upon him, to this side and that
Turning his eyes, as each approach he scanned,
And gnashing with his teeth. Thrice he surveys,
Boiling with anger, Aventine’s whole hill,
Thrice tries in vain the rocky portal, thrice
Sinks wearied in the valley. A sharp peak
Stood there, with rocky sides up-rising sheer
Above the cave’s back, far as sight could soar,
Fit dwelling for foul birds to build in. This,
As headlong from the ridge it leftward leaned
Over the river, from the right he shook
Straining against it, and up-wrenched, and tore
Loose from its lowest roots, then suddenly
Launched forth; and, as he launched it, bellowed loud
The mighty welkin, and asunder leapt
The river banks, and the affrighted stream
Flowed backward. But the cave and ample hall
Of Cacus lay discovered, bare to view,
With its dark hollows yawning to their depth:
As the rent earth should open wide her mouth,
Unlock the infernal dwellings and disclose
The pale realm hated of the gods, whereby
The vasty gulf should from above be seen,
And the ghosts tremble, as floods in the light.
Him, then, quick-caught by the unlooked-for glare,
Pent in his rock-cage, uttering uncouth roars,
Alcides from above plies home with darts,
Calls every arm to aid him, and bombards
With boughs and mighty mill-stones. He the while,
Escape none else remaining, from his jaws
Vomits a vast smoke, marvellous to tell,
Wraps in pitch darkness the whole den, and blots
All eyesight out, up-rolling from the abyss
One stifling night of blackness blent with fire.
This brooked not fierce Alcides: through the flames
With headlong bound he cast him, where the smoke
Was billowing densest, and the mighty cave
Boiled with black vapour. Cacus here he seized,
Still belching forth vain fires amid the gloom,
Locked limbs about him, and strangled as he cleaved,
Till his eyes started and his throat lacked blood.
Straight are the doors burst, the black den laid bare,
The stolen cattle and the theft forsworn
Shown to the eye of heaven; and by its feet
The huge misshapen carcass is dragged forth.
Men’s souls cannot be sated, as they gaze
Upon the terrible eyes, face, bristling breast
Of the man-monster, and his fire-quenched throat.
Hence sprang this high observance; and with joy
Have younger generations kept the day:
Potitius, the first founder, and the house
Pinarian, keeper of the sacred rites
Of Hercules, erected in the grove
This altar, which shall evermore be called
Mightiest, and mightiest evermore shall be.
“Up, then, O warriors! such high deeds to grace
Garland your locks, hold forth the cup in hand,
Call on our common god, and with good will
Pour ye the wine.” He scarce had said, when lo!
About his locks the twy-hued poplar’s twine,
Shade dear to Hercules, festooned and hung,
And his right hand the sacred beaker clasped.
Then on the board right quickly one and all
Make glad libation, and the gods adore.

Evening meanwhile adown Olympus’ slope
Draws nearer; and the priests, Potitius first,
Marched, as was wont, skin-clad and carrying fire.
They spread the board afresh, new dainties bring
For the new feast, and heap the altars high
With laden trenchers. Then come forth to sing
The Salii round the altar-glow, brow-bound
With sprays of poplar; here a band of youths,
Of elders there, commemorate in song
The fame and feats of Hercules; how first
With grip of hand he strangled the twin snakes,
The monsters of his step-mother; anon
Dashed peerless cities to the ground in war,
Troy and Oechalia: how hard toil on toil,
As King Eurystheus’ vassal, he endured,
By cruel Juno’s doom. “Unconquerable,
Thou didst the cloud-begotten and twy-formed
Hylaeus slay and Pholus with thy might,
Thou too the Cretan monster, and the vast
Lion that dwelt beneath the Nemean rock.
Trembled at thee the Stygian lake, at thee
Hell’s warder, couched above his mumbled bones
In the blood-boltered cave: no bodily shape
E’er daunted thee, no, not Typhoeus’ self,
Up-towering armed; nor round thee, shiftless caught,
Reared Lerna’s worm its multitudinous head.
Hail, very child of Jove, to the high gods
An added glory! with propitious foot
To us and thine own rites draw kindly nigh.”
Such themes in song they celebrate, and crown
All with the cave of Cacus, and himself
Out-panting blasts of fire. To their loud din
The whole grove echoes and the hills resound.

Then, sacrifice done duly, one and all
Turn city-ward. The king, o’er-crept with age,
Moved onward, keeping ever at his side
Aeneas and his son, with various talk
Lightening the way. Aeneas on all around
Casts quick admiring eyes; spot after spot
Enthralls him; and with rapture he inquires
And learns the legends of the men of old.
Then, founder of Rome’s fortress on the height,
Spake King Evander: “In these woodlands once
Dwelt native Fauns and Nymphs, a race of men
From tree-stocks sprung and stubborn hearts of oak,
Who had no rule, no art of life, nor knew
To yoke the steer, heap wealth, or husband it,
But fed on branches and rough hunting-fare.
Then from Olympus’ height first Saturn came,
Flying the arms of Jove, from his lost realm
An exile. He the untutored race, broadcast
Among the mountain-tops, together brought,
And gave them laws, and chose for the land’s name
*Latium*, since there safe-hidden he had lain.
Under his sceptre were the golden years
Men tell of, in such peace he ruled the folk;
Till a worse age and duller-hued crept in
Little by little, and wild rage of war,
And lust of having. Then the Ausonian host
And tribes Sicanian came; and many a time
The land of Saturn cast her name away;
Then kings arose, and with his monstrous bulk
Fierce Thybris, from whom we of Italy
Have since called Tiber’s river, when Albula
Lost its true olden name. Myself, from home
Outcast and exile, to the utmost bounds
Of ocean questing, the resistless might
Of Fortune and inevitable Fate
Here planted, by my mother’s dread behest,
The Nymph Carmentis, driven, and by the word
And warrant of Apollo’s voice divine.”
He said, and passing thence the altar shows
And gate Carmental, name by Rome of yore
In honour of the Nymph Carmentis given,
That prophetess of sooth, who first foretold
The future greatness of the Aeneadae
And Pallanteum’s glory. Next he shows
A vast grove which brave Romulus made serve
For sanctuary, and ’neath the chill rock’s depth
Lupercal, by Parrhasian custom called
Of Pan Lycaean. And he shows the grove
Of sacred Argiletum, and invokes
The spot to witness, and recounts the death
Of his guest Argus. Hence he leads them on
To the Tarpeian Rock, the Capitol,
Gay-golden now, but whilom bristling rough
With woodland thickets. Its dread awe made quake
Even then the fearful rustics; aye, even then
They shuddered at the forest and the rock.
“This grove,” said he, “this hill with leafy crown
Is a god’s dwelling, but what god’s, unknown.
Arcadia’s folk believe they oft have seen
Jove’s very hand the darkening aegis shake,
And summon up the storm-cloud. Here again
Two cities seest thou with dismantled walls,
Relics and records of the men of old:
One fort Sire Janus, and one Saturn, built—
This called Saturnia, that Janiculum.”
So parleying they drew nigh the roof where dwelt
Thrifty Evander, and saw cattle stray
Lowing within Rome’s Forum and superb
Carinae. When to his abode they came,
“These doors,” said he, “Alcides’ conquering feet
Once entered; him this palace hath contained.
Dare to spurn riches, O my guest, and shape
Thyself, too, worthy godship, and approach
All undisdainful of our humble hoard.”
He spake, and ’neath the roof-tree’s narrow slope
Led great Aeneas, and set him on a couch
Of strewn leaves, and a Libyan she-bear’s fell.
Night falls, and clasps the earth with dusky wings.

But Venus, mother-like, with no vain fear
Scared, and disturbed by the Laurentians’ threats
And rude up-rising, thus to Vulcan speaks,
And in her golden nuptial bower begins,
Breathing the love-tones of immortal lips:
“While Argive kings were ravaging with war
Troy’s doomed towers, and ramparts soon to sink
In hostile flames, no succour I, nor arms
Craved of thine art or power; nor, dearest lord,
Thee or thy travail would I tax for naught.
Deep though my debt to Priam’s sons, and oft
Though my tears mourned Aeneas’ sore distress.
Now, by Jove’s sovereign word, his foot stands firm
Upon the Rutule shore: I therefore now
Come suing, and of the godhead I adore
Crave boon of arms, a mother for her son.
Thee Nereus’ daughter, thee Tithonus’ bride,
Could with their tears unbend. See what a league
Of nations, see what cities with closed gates
Now whet the sword, to uproot me and mine.”
The goddess ceased, and with the soft embrace
Of snowy arms about his body wound
Fondled him, as he faltered. Quick he caught
The wonted fire; the old heat pierced his heart,
Ran through his melting frame: as oftentimes
A fiery rift, burst by the thunder-clap,
Runs quivering down the cloud, with flash of light.
This saw his spouse, and at her guile rejoiced
In conscious beauty. Then thus spake the God
Enthralled by love immortal: “Wherefore seek
Afar for pretexts? Whither then hath fled
Thy faith in me, my goddess? Nay, hadst thou
So yearned of yore, even then I had not sinned
To arm the Teucrians; nor the Almighty Sire,
Nor Fate forbad it, that for ten years yet
Troy-towers should stand, and Priam’s life endure.
And now, if war thou hast in hand to wage,
If such thy purpose, lo! what pains soe'er
My craft can offer, what from ore of iron
Or molten electrum may be wrought; so far
As fire and air may stead thee— cease to pray,
Mistrustful of thy power.” So saying, he gave
The embrace she longed for, on her bosom sank,
And wooed calm slumber to o’er-glide his limbs.

Soon as the first repose had banished sleep,
Hard on the half-way course of driven night,
What time a woman, forced to eke out life
With distaff and Minerva’s slender toil,
Stirs up the embers of her slumbering fire,
To labour adding night, and by the glare
Plies hard her handmaids o’er the tedious task,
That she may keep her husband’s couch from stain
And rear her infant sons, not otherwise,
Nor than that hour more slothful, from soft bed
Rose to his anvil-work the lord of fire.
There is an isle hard by Sicania’s coast
That rises, and Aeolian Lipare,
With smoking rocks precipitous, where beneath
Thunders a cave, and Aetna’s vaults, scooped out
By Cyclopean forges; the strong strokes
Of anvils to the ear bring echoing groans;
Hisses the steel ore through its hollow depths,
And from its furnaces pants fire— the home
Of Vulcan, and Vulcania the land’s name.
Then hither from heaven’s height the lord of fire
Descends. In their vast cave the Cyclops-brood
Were forging iron, Brontes and Steropes,
And naked-limbed Pyracmon. By their hands
Shaped, and e’en now part-burnished, was a bolt
Such as the Sire from heaven’s wide cope to earth
Hurls many a time; part yet unfinished lay.
Three shafts of writhen shower, of watery cloud
Three, had they fused together, three of red
Flame and of winged south-wind, and were now
Mingling terrific flashes with the work,
And din, and dread, and wrath’s pursuing fires.
Elsewhere a chariot and swift-flying wheels
For Mars were they dispatching, wherewithal
He rouseth men and cities, and eagerly
With serpent-scales of gold were burnishing
The terrible aegis, stormy Pallas’ arm,
Snakes intertwined, and on the goddess’ breast
The Gorgon’s self, throat-severed, and with eyes
Rolling. “Away with all!” he cried. “Take hence,
Aetnean Cyclopes, your unfinished tasks,
And hither hark ye: armour must be made
For a bold warrior. Now is need of strength,
Now of deft hands, and all your master-skill:
Spurn loitering!” There he ceased: they swiftly all
Bent to the task, like share to each assigned.
Flows brass in torrents, and flows ore of gold;
Melts in huge furnace the wound-working steel.
A mighty shield they shape, sole to withstand
All weapons of the Latins, welding it
Orb upon orb clenched seven-fold. Some, the while,
Working the windy bellows, in and out
Let the blasts drive; some dip i’ the water-trough
The sputtering brass: groans with their anvils’ weight
The cave-floor. They alternately in time
With giant strength uplift their arms, and turn
The massy metal with the forceps’ grip.

While on Aeolian shores the Lemnian sire
Speeds on the work, Evander the kind dawn
And matin-songs of birds beneath the eaves
Rouse from his lowly dwelling. The old man
Rises, and with a tunic clothes his limbs,
And binds Tyrrhenian sandals round his feet;
Then, fast to side and shoulder buckling on
A Tegean sword, flings back the panther’s hide
Low-drooping on his left: and therewithal
Twain watch-dogs from the lofty threshold go
Before him, and their master’s steps attend.
Toward the secluded chamber of his guest
Aeneas fared the hero, of their talk
Mindful, and his own promised boon. Nor less
Meanwhile Aeneas was astir betimes;
Beside him strode Achates, by the king
Pallas his son. Encountering they clasp hands.
Then, seated in the palace-midst, at length
Enjoy free converse. First the king began:
“O mightiest leader of the Teucrian host,
Who living, ne’er will I confess the realm
And power of Troy defeated,— scant enow,
To match a name so famous, are our means
Of warlike aid: on one side hems us in
The Tuscan river, on one the Rutule foe
Presses, and thunders round our wall in arms;
But mighty tribes, a camp with kingdoms rich
With thee to knit I purpose— safety shown
By chance unlooked for. At the call of Fate
Hither thou wendest. Not far distant lies
A peopled city, reared of ancient stone,
Agylla, where the war-famed Lydian race
Once had their home upon the Etruscan heights.
Full many a year it flourished, and then passed
’Neath the proud sceptre and fierce iron sway
Of king Mezentius. Why the tale repeat—
His impious butcheries and mad tiger-deeds?
Hoard them, ye gods, on his own head to fall,
And on his children’s! Nay, he would even link
Dead corpses to the quick, hand locked to hand,
And mouth to mouth— grim torment— and so steeped
In the rank moisture of that vile embrace
By lingering death destroy them. But at length,
Sick of his frantic raging, his own folk
Hie them to arms, close king and palace round,
Cut down the guards, and at the roof fling fire.
He, ’mid the carnage, safe to Rutule soil
Flies, and finds shelter with the friendly host
Of Turnus. All Etruria hereupon
Hath risen in righteous fury, and reclaims
Her king for vengeance. Of these thousands I
Will make thee chief, Aeneas: for their ships
O’er all the shore throng clamouring, and bid march
To battle, whom their aged seer restrains,
Thus chanting doom: ‘Maeonia’s chosen hearts,
Prime flower and pith of a brave race of old,
Whom righteous anger hurls upon the foe,
Fired with just wrath against Mezentius, none
Italian-born so proud a race may tame;
Choose outland leaders.’ Then the Etruscan host,
By the gods’ warning frighted, on yon plain
Reposed them. Tarchon to myself hath sent
Envoys, with crown and sceptre of the realm,
The signs of empire to my charge commits,
Bids join the camp, assume the Etruscan sway.
But me the numbing frost of time-worn eld,
And strength past exploit, grudge the high command.
My son I had urged, but that his mother’s blood
Blent him a Sabine and half native here.
Thou who in years and lineage both alike
Of Fate art favoured, whom the heavens demand,
Go forth, most valiant leader of the sons
Of Troy and Italy. Aye, and with thee
Pallas, my comfort and life’s hope, I’ll send;
Thy scholar, let him learn to brook the field
And the stern work of war, thy deeds behold,
And thee from youth’s first opening years admire.
Arcadian horse two hundred, our picked strength
Of manhood, I will give him, and the like
Pallas in his own name shall give to thee.”
Scarce had he said: Aeneas, Anchises’ son,
And true Achates, with eyes earthward bent,
On many a peril mournfully ’gan muse,
When lo! the Cytherean from clear skies
Gave signal: for, unlooked for, out of heaven
Came quivering flash and thunder-peal, and all
Seemed sudden to reel round them, and anon
A Tyrrhene trumpet-clang through heaven to blare.
Upward they glance; again and yet again
Crashed the vast din; then, canopied in cloud
Amid a stormless region of clear air,
Lo! the red gleam and thunderous shock of arms.
Others stood heart-amazed, but in that sound
Troy’s hero knew his heavenly mother’s pledge.
Then, “Seek not, O my host, seek not,” he cried,
“What fate the portent bodes; ’tis I am called
From heaven. This sign the goddess who me bare
Foretold, should war assail us, she would send,
And wafted through the air from Vulcan bring
Armour to aid me. What vast carnage now
Hangs o’er the doomed Laurentines! What a price,
O Turnus, shalt thou pay me! ’Neath thy tide
How many shields, helms, bodies of the brave
Wilt roll, O father Tiber! Let them call
Their armies out, and snap the cords of peace!”
So saying, he gat him from his lofty seat,
And first with fire to Hercules awakes
The slumbering altars, and with joy draws nigh
The Lar of yesterday, and hearth-gods small.
Alike Evander and Troy’s youth alike
Slay duly chosen victims. To the ships
Then hies the hero, and re-seeks the crews,
And of their number culls the flower of war
To follow him afield; the remnant left
Ride on the downward stream, and idly float
With favouring current, to return and tell
Ascanius of their fortunes and his sire.
To Teucria’s sons for Tyrrhene borders bound
Chargers are given; a steed of choice they lead
Forth for Aeneas, in tawny lion’s skin
Housed wholly, that gleamed out with claws of gold.
Noised through the little town swift rumour flies
That to the palace of the Tyrrhene king
Horsemen are speeding. Mothers then for fear
Their vows redouble; more close on peril treads
Panic, and larger looms the shape of war.
Then to his son’s right hand, at point to go,
Fast clings Evander, and insatiate weeps.
“Ah! would but Jupiter,” he cries, “give back
The years departed, and the man I was
When close beneath Praeneste I mowed down
The foremost ranks, kindled the heaped shields
Victorious, and to nether darkness hurled
With this right hand king Erulus! to him,
Her son, Feronia at his birth had given—
Fearful to tell— a triple life to live,
Thrice to bear arms, thrice o’er to be in death
Down-stricken: yet him of all his lives that day
This right hand robbed, and stripped of arms to match.
Ne’er from thy dear embrace had I been torn,
As now, my son; nor on this neighbour-head
With armed insult had Mezentius dealt
Carnage so cruel, nor of so many sons
Bereaved my city. But O, ye powers above,
And Jupiter, prime potentate of heaven,
Pity, I you beseech, Arcadia’s king,
And hear a father’s prayer: ‘If your dread wills,
If Fate, keep whole my Pallas, if life be
Once more to see and meet him, then for life
I beg, all burdens can with patience bear.
But, if some dire mischance thou threatenest, now,
Now, Fortune, let me snap life’s cruel thread,
While sorrow masks her meaning, while hope hangs
Uncertain of the future, while I hold
Thee, boy beloved, my late and lone delight,
Clasped thus, nor heavier tidings wound mine ear.’ ”
Such final farewell words the sire outpoured,
Then swooned, and by his serfs was borne within.

Now had the horse-troop through the open gates
Issued: Aeneas at their head with true
Achates came; then other lords of Troy.
Pallas himself midmost the column rode,
With scarf and inwrought arms conspicuous seen:
As when the dawn-star, washed in ocean’s wave,
Dearer to Venus than all stellar fires,
Uplifts in heaven his sacred head and melts
The darkness. Mothers on the ramparts stand
Trembling, and following with their eyes afar
The dust-cloud, and the squadrons bright with brass.
They through the brushwood, where the journey’s end
Lay nearest, move in arms: a shout goes up,
And in formed column, hark! the four-foot tramp
Of galloping horse-hoofs shakes the crumbling plain.
There is a vast grove near cold Caere’s stream,
Wide-worshipped with ancestral awe; a cirque
Of hollow hills enfolds it, with black pine
Girdling the forest. ’Twas dedicate, folk tell,
Both grove and feast-day, to Silvanus, god
Of field and flock, by the Pelasgians old,
Who erst within the Italian borders dwelt.
Not far from hence, camped in a sheltered spot,
Were Tarchon and the Etruscans; all their host
From the high hill-top might be seen outspread
Along the tented fields. Hither repair
Aeneas and his chosen warrior train,
And for tired limbs and horses find repose.
But Venus, the white goddess, gifts in hand,
Now through the clouds of heaven drew near, and when
Her son she spied in the lone vale afar,
By the cool stream sequestered, with such words
Hailing, she flashed her presence on his sight:
“Lo! by my lord’s skill perfected, I bring
The promised boon, that thou not shrink, my son,
Or proud Laurentians or keen Turnus’ self
To bid to battle.” Cytherea spake,
And sought her son’s embrace: the gleaming arms
Beneath a fronting oak she set. He, glad
Of the divine gift and deep honour done,
Gazes insatiate, and from point to point
Lets his eyes wander, and admires, and turns
’Twixt hand and arm the terrible-crested helm
Out-darting fires, and the death-dealing sword,
And stiff brass-tempered corslet, blood-red, huge,
As when a dark-blue cloud from the sun’s rays
Takes fire, and gleams afar; then the smooth greaves—
Electrum and twice-smelted gold— the spear
And inexpressible fabric of the shield.
There had the fire-lord, skilled in prophet-lore,
Nor witless of the future, wrought the tale
Of Italy, the triumph-roll of Rome,
There all the kindred of the race to be,
Sprung from Ascanius, and the wars they waged,
One after one; thereon too he had wrought
The parent-wolf in the green cave of Mars
Lying outstretched; around her teats the twins
Hung playing, and to their mother set their lips
Undaunted; she, with shapely neck bent back,
Fondles by turns, and moulds them with her tongue.
Nor far from hence he had portrayed withal
Rome, and the Sabine maidens’ lawless rape
In the thronged seats at the great Circus games,
And a new war up-starting, as the sons
Of Romulus with aged Tatius closed
And his stern Cures. Next, the strife allayed,
Lo! these two kings were standing armed before
Jove’s altar, cup in hand, as each with each
They knit firm treaty o’er a slaughtered swine.
Hard by, the four-horse cars swift-driven had torn
Mettus in twain— thou shouldst have kept thine oath,
O Albani!— through the brake the liar’s limbs
Tullus is haling; the splashed thorns drip blood.
Here too Porsenna, bidding them take back
The banished Tarquin, with a mighty siege
Hemmed in the city, while Aeneas’ sons
Rushed on the sword for freedom. You might see
Wrath’s semblance, aye, and menace in his face.
That Cocles should so dare break down the bridge,
And Cloelia, with snapped fetters, swim the flood.
There on the top of the Tarpeian hold,
Manlius, before the temple standing guard,
Held the high Capitol, the royal roof
New-bristling with the thatch of Romulus.
And here, in gilded colonnades, the goose
Fluttered in silver, shrieking that the Gauls
Were at the gate! And lo! the Gauls were near
Among the brushwood, hard upon the height,
Shielded by darkness and night’s cloudy boon.
Of gold their locks, and golden their attire;
They glitter in striped cloaks, their milk-white necks
Circled with gold; two Alpine javelins each
They brandish, and long bucklers guard their limbs.
And here the dancing Salii he had forged,
And bare Luperci, the wool-tufted caps,
And shields that fell from heaven: and through the streets
Chaste matrons the high pomp on cushioned cars
Were leading. Far from hence hereto he adds
The halls Tartarean, lofty doors of Dis,
And dooms of sin, and, on the sheer rock poised,
Thee, Catiline, by Fury-faces scared,
And in sequestered seats the good— to them
Cato dispensing justice. Thereamidst
Rolled wide the semblance of the swelling main
Golden, but with hoar billows foamed the blue;
And dolphins of bright silver, circling round,
Swept ocean with their tails, and cleft the tide.
And fleets of brass i’ the centre could be seen,
The battle-lines of Actium; you might mark
Leucate all a-glow with war’s array,
And billows gleaming gold. Here to the strife
Caesar Augustus leading forth the host
Of Italy, with fathers and with folk,
The hearth-gods and the mighty gods of heaven,
Stands on the lofty stern; from his bright brows
Shoot two-fold fires, and his ancestral star
Dawns overhead. Elsewhere Agrippa towers,
Leading the line with winds and gods to aid;
Bright gleam his temples— proud device of war—
Beaked with the naval crown. Antonius here
With host barbaric and with motley arms,
Triumphant from the peoples of the dawn
And the Red Sea, brings Aegypt in his train,
The Orient’s strength, and utmost Bactria,
Followed, O shame! by his Aegyptian bride.
Lo! all rush on together; the whole deep foams,
With in-drawn oars and triple beaks up-torn.
Seaward they press; thou’dst deem the Cyclades
Uprooted swam the main, or mountains tall
Crashed against mountains, with such monstrous weight
The warriors mass them on the tower-crowned poops.
Hurled from the hand are showers of flaming tow
And winged steel missiles: with new carnage blush
The fields of Neptune. In their midst the queen
With native timbrel cheers her ranks, nor sees
As yet the twin snakes threatening from the rear.
Barking Anubis and strange-bodied gods
Of every kindred, against Neptune ranged
And Venus and Minerva, poise their darts.
Storms Mavors in the battle’s midst, embossed
In iron, with the fell Furies from on high;
And, in rent robe rejoicing, Discord stalks,
Bellona at her heels with blood-stained scourge.
Actian Apollo saw, and from above
His bow was bending: at whose terror all
Aegypt and Ind, with Arabs, every man,
And all the sons of Saba, turned and fled.

The queen herself to gales that heard her cry
Seemed spreading canvas, and now, now in act
To slip the loosened sheet. The lord of fire
Had fashioned her pale-faced with coming death
Amid the fray, borne on by wave and wind;

And opposite, in all his mighty bulk
Mourns Nilus, and throws open fold on fold,
With wide-spread vesture welcoming the rout
To his blue lap and watery fastnesses. 717

But Caesar, here in triple triumph borne
Within Rome's ramparts, to Italia's gods
Was dedicating through the city's breadth
Three hundred mighty fanes, his deathless vow;
With gladness, games, and shouting the streets rang.
In all the fanes were matron-bands, in all
Were blazing altars; at each altar-foot
Slain bullocks strewed the ground. The hero's self,
On fire-bright Phoebus' snowy threshold throned,
Tells o'er and hangs above those haughty gates
The gifts of nations. In long pomp wind on
The vanquished peoples, manifold of speech,
As in the fashion of their garb and gear. 725

Here Mulciber the nomad race had formed,
And ungirt Africans, the Leleges
And Cares, and Gelonian arrow-men;
There went Euphrates now with humbler wave,
And, utmost of mankind, the Morini,
The horned Rhine, and Dahae unsubdued,
And proud Araxes chafing to be bridged.
Such marvels sees the hero on Vulcan's shield,
His mother's gift, and glorying in the signs
Of things he knows not, high on shoulder heaves
The fame and fortunes of his sons to be. 731

## BOOK IX

Now while elsewhere afar these things are done,
Saturnian Juno hath to Turnus bold
Sent Iris out of heaven. It chanced that then
Turnus amidst his sire Pilumnus' grove
Sat in the sacred dell; to whom, as thus,
The child of Thaumas spake with rosy lip:
“That which no god had dared at thy desire
To pledge thee, Turnus, lo! the circling hour
Hath brought unbidden. Town, fleet, and comrades
left,
Aeneas hies him to Evander's seat
And sceptre of the Palatine; nay, more,
To the utmost towns of Corythus hath pierced,
And gathers in armed bands the rustic folk
Of Lydia. Palter not; now, now's the time
To call for steeds and chariot; stop for naught,
But instant fall on their disordered camp.” 13

She spake, and, on poised pinions reared aloft,
Cut flying a mighty bow beneath the clouds.
The warrior knew her, and, both hands upraised,
With such-like words her flying form pursued:
“Who sped thee, Iris, ornament of heaven,
Adown the cloud-way earthward to my side?
From whence this sudden splendour of the sky?
I see the pole part midway, and the stars
Roving the vault. I follow the great sign,
Whoe'er thou art, my summoner to arms.”
So saying, he gat him to the stream, from off
Its eddying face drew water, to the gods
Breathed many a prayer, and burdened heaven with
vows. 24

And now his war-host through the open plain
Moved onward in its might; no lack of steeds,
No lack of broidered raiment and of gold.
The vanward ranks Messapus sways, the rear
The warrior-sons of Tyrrheus; midmost rides
Turnus, their captain: as with seven still streams
Ganges in silence rising high, or Nile,
When his rich river ebbs from off the plain,
And now hath sunk within his bed. Anon
The Teucrians a black cloud of sudden dust
See gather, and darkness rise upon the plain.
First from a fronting mound Cai'cus cries: 35
“What mass of pitchy gloom, my countrymen,
Rolls onward? Speed to arms, bring weapons, mount
The walls! The foeman is upon us, ho!”
With clamorous shouts the Teucrians through all gates
Plunge in, and fill the ramparts. For even thus
Aeneas, warrior peerless, ere he went
Had charged them, if that aught meanwhile should
hap,
Nor venture to draw out the ranks of war,
Nor trust the plain, but keep the camp alone,
And sheltering bulwark of the walls. So now,
Though shame and anger point them to the field,
The gates they bar, his bidding do, and armed
Within their hollow towers await the foe. 46

Turnus, whose swift advance his tardier troop
Had distanced, with a score of chosen horse
Behind him, stands, ere looked for, at the gate;
Borne on a Thracian steed of dappled white,
A gold helm guards him decked with ruddy plume.
“Friends, is there any will first upon the foe
With me?”— he cries, “now mark you”: and a spear
Whirling he casts, as prelude of the fray,
And, towering high, careers along the plain. 53
His men catch up the challenge clamorously,
And with terrific war-cries follow: much
They marvel at the Teucrians' laggard hearts,
That a fair field they face not, nor abide
The battle-shock like men, but hug the camp.
Hither and thither stormily he rides
Scanning the ramparts, and, where way is none,
Questing for entrance. As a wolf, that lies
In wait for some full sheep-fold, at the doors
Stands howling, buffeted of wind and rain
At midnight; safe beneath their mother's sides
The lambs bleat loudly; he, with savage wrath
Insatiate, rages out of reach, spurred on
By the long-gathering frantic lust of food,
And droughty jaws unbloodied: even so
The Rutule's wrath takes fire, as on their walls
And camp he gazes: in his iron frame
Burns indignation—by what art essay
An entrance? from behind their ramparts how
Drive forth the Teucrians, pour them on the plain? 68

The fleet, which close beside the camp lay snug,
Hedged round with earthworks and the river-wave,
On this he falls, to his exulting mates
Cries out for fire, and grasps, himself on flame,
A blazing pine-torch. Then to work they fall,
Spurred on by Turnus' presence; the whole troop
Arm them with murky brands: the hearths are
stripped;
The reeking torch sends up a pitchy glare,
And Vulcan wafts the sooty lees to heaven. 76

What god, O Muses, from the Teucrians turned
So vast a conflagration? from their decks
Who dashed the fire? It is an old-world faith,
But famed for ever. What time Aeneas first,
On Phrygian Ida fashioning his fleet,
To the high seas addressed him, in such wise
The Berecynthian mother of the gods
Spake to Almighty Jove: “Grant, son, the boon
Which thy dear mother for Olympus quelled
Now craves of thee. A pine-forest had I
Beloved for many a year, a grove that crowned
The hill-top, whither offerings would be brought,
Dark with black pitch-trees and with maple-boles:
These, when a fleet he lacked, full fain I gave
Unto the Dardan youth: now anxious fear
Disquiets and torments me. Loose my dread,
And let a parent's prayers prevail, that these
Nor voyage may break, nor whirlwind overwhelm;
So speed them from my mountains to have sprung.” 92
To whom her son, who wheels the starry worlds:
“Whither would'st bid the Fates? for these thy barks
What seek'st thou, Mother? Shall ships of mortal
build
Win rights immortal, or Aeneas roam
Through changeful perils, unassailed by change?
What god may boast such plenitude of power?
Nay, but when, service o'er, they one day reach
Their bourne, Ausonia's haven, such as then
Have 'scaped the waves, and borne the Dardan chief
To shores Laurentian, these will I divest
Of mortal mould, and bid be goddesses
Of the great deep, as Doto, Nereus' child,
And Galatea, who breast the foaming sea.”
He spake, and by his Stygian brother's stream,
Banks that with pitch and a black whirlpool boil,
Nodded assent, and with the nod set all
Olympus quaking. 106

So the promised day
Had come, the Fates their destined hours fulfilled,
When Turnus' outrage the great Mother warned
To drive the fire-brands from her sacred ships.
Here a strange light first flashed upon their eyes,
And from the Dawn a vast cloud seemed to speed
Athwart the sky, with Ida's choirs. Then fell
An awful utterance through the air, that filled
Both Trojan ranks and Rutule: “Trouble not,
Ye Teucrians, to defend my ships, nor arm
Your hands with weapons; Turnus shall have power
To burn the seas up, ere yon sacred pines,
And go ye free, go, Ocean-goddesses;
The Mother bids you.” And the barks forthwith
Rend each her cable from the bank, dip beaks,
And dive like dolphins to the watery depth;
Then one and all—stupendous prodigy—
As maiden-forms emerge, and stem the main. 122

Astounded were the Rutules; terror fell
Even on Messapus and his plunging steeds;
Tiber himself, hoarse-murmuring, stays his flood,
And from the deep recoils. But not for that
Quailed the bold heart of Turnus; nay, with words
He roused their spirit, and spared not even to chide:
“These portents threat the Trojans; aye, from them
Great Jove himself hath reft their wonted aid;
They bide not Rutule darts and fires. So then
The seas are trackless to the Teucrians, flight
Denied them, and one half the world cut off;
As for the mainland, in our grasp it lies;
So many thousands—tribes of Italy—
For battle stand. The bodeful dooms of heaven,
Howe'er the Phrygians vaunt them, fright not me: 134
Enough to Fate and Venus hath been given,
That Troy has touched Ausonia's fertile shore.
I too have counter-fates, to smite nor spare
The accursed stock that balks me of my bride;
Not Atreus' sons alone that pang can pierce,
Nor but Mycenae's city rise in arms. 139
‘But suffering once suffices’? Yes, had once
To sin sufficed them, hating from their hearts
Well nigh all woman-kind. And these to trust
Their screening rampart, by a hindering trench
Emboldened, a poor span 'twixt death and them!
Why, saw they not Troy-walls, by Neptune's hand
Up-builded, sink in flame? But which of you,
My chosen hearts, makes ready to hew down
The rampart at sword's point, and rush with me
Upon their fluttered camp? No need have I
Of arms from Vulcan, or a thousand keels,
To face the Teucrians. Let Etruria now
Band all her sons to aid them. They need fear
No darkness, no Palladium's coward theft,
Or sentries slaughtered on the fortress-height.
Nor will we shroud us in a horse's womb
Out of men's eyes. In the broad light of day
We are purposed to ring round their walls with fire. 153
I trow they shall not say they have to do
With Danaan and Pelasgic chivalry,
Whom Hector till the tenth year baffled. Now,
Day's better part o'erpast, for what remains,
Refresh you, warriors, heartened by success,
And deem, so doing, ye fit you for the fray.” 158

Meanwhile Messapus to blockade the gates
Hath charge with sentry-pickets, and surround
The works with watch-fires. Twice seven Rutule chiefs
Are chosen with soldiery to keep the walls;
Each has a hundred warriors in his train,
Gay with red helmet-plumes and glittering gold.
They speed apart, and shift the alternate watch,
Or, stretched on greensward, let the wine have way,
And tilt the brazen bowls. The fires burn bright;
The guard with games the sleepless night prolong. 167
This spy the Trojans from the rampart's height,
As armed they man the summit; in trembling haste
They try the gates, yoke bridge and tower, bring darts.
Mnestheus and keen Serestus goad them on,
Whom Prince Aeneas, should mischance demand,
Set to control the host and guide the war.
Parting the peril, the whole band by turn,
Each at his post, keep watch along the walls. 176

Nisus, keen warrior, held the gate, the son
Of Hyrtacus, whom in Aeneas' train
Ida the huntress sent; quick-handed he
With spear, and light-winged arrows; beside him
Euryalus, than whom no comelier youth
Clave to Aeneas, or donned Trojan arms—
Whose smooth boy-face showed faint the budding
man.
These had one heart between them: side by side
They wont to rush on battle; and now too
Each with like charge was posted at the gate. 183

Quoth Nisus: “Is't the gods thus fire our hearts,
Or maketh each his wild desire a god,
Euryalus? My heart's long since afret
On war to launch me, or some great essay,
With stagnant ease ill-satisfied. Thou seest
What confidence in fortune holds the foe:
Few gleam their lights and far; themselves lie prone,
In sleep and wine dissolved; all's hushed around.
Mark further what I muse of, in my mind
What purpose rises. 'Tis the cry of all,
Both folk and fathers, that we summon back
Aeneas, send messengers with tidings sure. 193
If what I ask they promise thee—myself
The deed's own fame suffices—'neath yon mound
Methinks my feet would guide me to the walls
And fort of Pallanteum.” Euryalus,
Thrilled and transfixed with mighty love of praise,
Thus at the word his glowing friend bespeaks:
“Nisus, dost shun to knit me to thy side
In high exploit? Or should I let thee go
To face such perils singly? 'Twas not thus
My sire Opheltes, to war's work inured,
'Mid Argive terrors and the woes of Troy
Trained me and reared; nor at thy side have I
So borne me, since I followed to the field
High-souled Aeneas and his utmost fate.
Here, here's a soul that scorns the sunlight, deems
That fame thou striv'st for cheaply bought with life.” 206
Then Nisus: “No such fear of thee had I,
Nor just it were; nay, so may mighty Jove,
Or whoso on these things bends favouring eye,
Restore me to thy side in triumph. But if—
As oft in such adventure thou behold'st—
Some chance or god should hurry me to harm,
I would that thou survive me. At thine age
It is more meet to live. O, be there one
To lay me, snatched or ransomed from the fray,
In earth, or, if some wonted hap forbid,
Pay funeral offerings to my absent dust,
And grace me with a tomb! Nor let me bring
Such grief on that sad mother, who, alone
Of many mothers, dared follow thee, her boy,
And hath no heart for great Acestes' town.” 215
But he: “Thou weavest empty pleas in vain,
Nor doth my purpose alter or give way.
Speed we betimes!” He spake, and roused the watch,
Who to their charge succeed, then quits his post,
And, step by step with Nisus, seeks the prince.
All creatures else on earth were easing care
With slumber, and their hearts forgot to ache.
The foremost Teucrian lords, their flower of war,
Were kingdom's weal debating—what to do,
Who to Aeneas should the tidings bear. 228

Leaning on their long spears, and shield on arm,
Midmost the camp in a clear space they stood.
Then Nisus and with him Euryalus
In eager haste crave audience: what they urged
Was weighty, and would recompense delay.
Iulus first to their impatient suit
Gave audience, and bade Nisus speak; then thus
The son of Hyrtacus: “O sons of Troy,
Hearken with kindly heed, nor let the worth
Of what we offer by our years be weighed.
Dissolved in wine and sleep, the Rutuli
Keep silence: our own eyes have marked a spot
For stratagem left open, where yon gate
Lets in or out upon the seaward side. 237
Their line of fires is broken, and black smoke
Goes up to heaven. Let us but use the chance
To seek Aeneas and Pallanteum's fort,
Soon will ye see us here at hand with spoils,
After great slaughter done. Nor will the way
We go beguile us: down the valleys dim,
Assiduous in the chase, we have seen gleam
The city, and all the river-windings know.”
Aletes hereupon, with years o'erweighed
And ripe of wisdom, spake: “Gods of our sires,
Whose power divine still watches over Troy,
Howbeit, ye think not a full end to make
Of all the Teucrians, in that ye vouchsafe
Our youth such valour and heart-steadfastness.”
So saying, the shoulders and right hands of both
Embraced he, and bathed all his face with tears. 257
“What guerdon, heroes, of your glorious deeds
Can I deem worthy to be paid you? First
Heaven and your own hearts will the best bestow;
Then good Aeneas, what else remains anon
Will yield you, and Ascanius, whose fresh youth
Service so noble never can forget.”
“Nay I,” breaks in Ascanius, “whose sole hope
Of safety hangs upon my sire's return,
By the great hearth-gods, Nisus, thee adjure,
The guardian spirit of Assaracus,
And hoary Vesta's shrine; whatever I have
Of faith or fortune in your laps I lay:
Bring back my sire, restore him to my sight:
He here again, grief is not. Goblets twain
Silver-wrought, rough with tracery, will I give,
Ta'en by my sire, what time he smote and quelled
Arisba, and twin tripods, and of gold
Two mighty talents, and a bowl of yore,
Sidonian Dido's gift. But if our lot
Be to take Italy, to win and wield
A conqueror's sceptre, and mete out the spoil—
Thou sawest the war-steed whereon Turnus rode
In arms, all golden—none but that, with shield
And ruddy plume, O Nisus, will I pluck
Forth from the lot, thine even from this day. 277
Matrons twice six beside of choicest form
My sire will give thee, and men-captives eke,
All with their armour, and of land, to boot,
What King Latinus hath for his domain.
But thee, thrice honoured youth, whose age my own
Doth in the race press closer, from this hour
To my whole heart I take, betide what may,
And clasp thee for my comrade. Without thee,
For mine own lot no glory shall be wooed;
Come peace or war, to thee, both deed and word,
Be all my heart unbosomed.” Answered then
Euryalus: “From such bold venture me
No time shall prove degenerate, let but Fate
Be kind, not cruel. But all gifts beyond,
One boon I beg: I have a mother sprung
From Priam's ancient race, whom Ilian land
Held not, poor soul, nor king Acestes' town
From faring forth with me. Her now I leave
Unwitting of this peril, whatsoe'er,
Aye, and ungreeted—Night and thy right hand
My witness be—for that I may not brook
A parent's weeping. But do thou, I pray,
Comfort her need and aid her loneliness. 289
Let me bear hence this hope of thee: hereby
Into all dangers I shall boldlier go.”
Touched to the heart, the Dardans wept, and fair
Iulus before all, whose soul was wrung
With likeness of the love he bore his sire.
Then thus he speaks: “Assure thee of all done
That thy great exploit merits: for she shall be
As my own mother, lacking but the name
Creusa; nor slight honour waits the womb
That bore so nobly. Let what fortune may
Be the deed's sequel, by this head I vow,
As oft my sire was wont, whate'er to thee
I promise, prosperously returned, the same
Shall for thy mother and thy kin abide.” 302
Weeping he spake, and from his shoulder doffs
A gilded sword, which erst Lycaon of Crete
Wrought with rare skill, and fitted for the hand
With ivory sheath. A shaggy lion's hide
Mnestheus to Nisus gives; Aletes true
Makes interchange of helmets. Thus arrayed
Onward they move, whom all the band of chiefs,
Both young and old, escorting to the gates,
Follow with vows. And fair Iulus too,
Armed with man's thought and spirit beyond his
years,
Full many a message to his sire bade bear.
But one and all the rude winds rend amain,
And to the clouds consign them unfulfilled. 313

Thence issuing forth, they cross the trench, and seek
Through shades of night the foeman's camp—yet first
To be the death of many. In drunken sleep
Stretched on the greensward scattered forms they see,
Cars tilted on the beach, 'twixt wheels and reins
Their masters, and with these one litter of arms
And wine. First spake the son of Hyrtacus:
“Now for a bold stroke! now, Euryalus,
The deed itself invites; here lies our way.
Watch thou, and keep wide outlook, lest some hand
Should from behind assail us: here will I
Deal havoc, and by a broad lane lead thee on.” 323
He spake, then checks his utterance, and lets drive
At haughty Rhamnes, who, it chanced, high-propped
On heaped carpets, the full-chested breath
Of sleep was heaving—king himself, and seer,
Best-loved of kingly Turnus; but no whit
His seer-craft might avail to ward off doom.
Three of his folk hard by, at random laid
Among their weapons, he takes unaware,
And the armour-bearer, aye, and charioteer
Of Remus, close beside his horses caught,
And with the sword shears through their lolling
necks; 331
Then from their lord himself he lops the head,
And leaves the red trunk gurgling; with black gore
Reek couch and greensward. Lamyrus withal,
Lamus, and young Serranus, who that night
Had played full long, and in his beauty's pride
Lay there limb-vanquished by the o'erpotent god—
Ah! happier had he played a night-long bout,
Nor made an end till morn!—such havoc as when
An unfed lion, ravaging amid
Full sheep-folds—for mad famine goads him on—
Mangles and rends the mild flock mute with fear,
And roars with blood-stained mouth. Nor less mean-
while
The slaughter of Euryalus; he too
Rages like fire, and, as they blocked his path,
Falls on a vast and nameless crowd, and slays
Fadus, Herbesus, Rhoetus, Abaris,
Or ere they knew it. Rhoetus awake saw all,
But crouched in fear behind a mighty bowl; 346
Full in whose breast, as up he rose, the youth
At arm's length, to the hilt, his sword-blade plunged,
And steeped in death withdrew it. He pours forth
The red life, dying, and blood-mingled wine;
The other on his dark errand hotly hies.
Now was he making for Messapus' train,
Where the last gleams of dying fire, and steeds
Tethered a-row, and grazing, he beheld,
When Nisus briefly—for he saw him borne
Beyond all bounds with lust of carnage—cried:
“Forbear we now; the unfriendly dawn draws nigh. 355
We have drunk full deep of vengeance, through the
foe
Hewed out a passage.” Many a trophy fair—
Men's arms of solid silver wrought, and bowls,
And sumptuous coverlets, they leave behind.
Euryalus the trappings tears away
And gold-bossed belt of Rhamnes, which of yore
Right wealthy Caedicus sent as a gift
To Remulus of Tibur, when from far
For friend he sought him: to his grandson's hand
Dying he left them, by the Rutule host
After his death in war and battle won.
These he tears off, and on his shoulders brave
Binds, but in vain, then dons Messapus' helm
Well-fitted, plume-adorned. So forth from camp
They pass, and make for safety. 366

But meanwhile
Horsemen, sent forward from the Latin town,
While halts the main host on the plain arrayed,
Came bringing answers for King Turnus' ear,
Three hundred, shield-men all, by Volscens led.
Even now they approach the camp, and near the wall,
When at some distance they descry the twain
Rounding the path to leftward; and the helm
In glimmer of night betrayed Euryalus
Unheedful, and flashed back the opposing ray:
Nor seen for naught. Cries Volscens from his troop: 375
“Stand, warriors; wherefore thus afoot? and say
Who are ye that go armed, and whither fare?”
Naught urge they in reply, but speed amain
Into the woods, and trust them to the night.
The horsemen interpose, bar right and left
The well-known crossways, and with sentinels
Fringe every outlet. The wood bristled wide
With brambles and dark ilex, every way
Choked with impenetrable thorns; the path
Through the dim forest-tracks gleamed brokenly. 385
Euryalus by darkness of the boughs
Perplexed, and spoil-encumbered, is by fear
Fooled of his bearings. Nisus wins clear off:
And now, all heedless, he had passed the foe,
And region, afterward from Alba's name
Hight Alban—then the lofty cattle-stalls
Of King Latinus—when he stopped, looked back
For his lost friend, in vain. “Euryalus,
Unhappy one! where have I left thee? how
Follow, and unthrid all the tangled path
Of treacherous woodland?” Therewith, questing back,
His footsteps he retraces, roaming on
Through the hushed brakes. He hears the horses'
tread,
Hears the loud din and signals of pursuit. 397
Nor long the time till to his ear a shout
Comes, and he sees Euryalus, whom trapped
By the false ground and darkness, and confused
By sudden onslaught, the whole band even now
Hale onward, struggling valiantly, in vain.
What can he do? Say, with what force, what arms
A rescue dare? Or should he rush on doom
Amid the sword-blades, and precipitate
Through wounds a glorious death? Quick drawing
back
His arm, and brandishing a spear, he looks
Up to the moon in heaven, and prays aloud: 403
“Thou, goddess, thou, Latona's child, be near
To aid my effort, glory of the stars
And guardian of the groves; if Hyrtacus
My sire hath ever to thine altars brought
Gifts for my sake, if any I myself
Have added from the chase, and in thy dome
Hung them, or fastened to thy sacred roof,
Let me confound this banded mass, and guide
My darts through air.” He spake, and hurls the steel
With his whole body's strength. The flying spear
Sunders the shades of night, meets the turned back
Of Sulmo, and there snaps, the splintered shaft
Riving his heart: he, spouting from his breast
The hot life-stream, rolls over, chilled in death,
And long gasps heave his palpitating sides. 413
All eyes look every way. He thereupon
The keenlier poises, see! a second dart
Aimed from the ear-tip. While they hesitate,
Through Tagus' either temple sped the spear
Hissing, and clave warm in the pierced brain.
Volscens storms fiercely, but can nowhere spy
The wielder of the weapon, nor whereon
To launch his fury. “Thou at least,” he cried,
“Shalt with thy life-blood pay the debt of both,”
And so drew sword, and on Euryalus
Was rushing. Then indeed, with terror mad,
Nisus shrieks wildly, nor can shroud himself
Longer in darkness, or such anguish bear: 426
“Here, here am I, the doer; on me, on me
Turn all your steel, O Rutules! Mine the fault,
Mine only: he nor dared, nor could have done it;
This heaven, these stars, be witness, that know all!
He only loved his hapless friend too well.”
So spake he; but the sword, with strength driven
home,
Has pierced the ribs, and rends the snowy breast.
Euryalus rolls in death; the blood runs o'er
His beauteous limbs, and on his shoulder sinks
The faint neck: as a bright flower, by the plough
Shorn through, droops dying, or poppies weary-necked,
By a chance shower o'er-weighted, bow the head. 437
But Nisus leaps amidst them, seeks through all
Volscens alone, for none but Volscens stays.
The foe, massed round him close on either side,
Beat him aback. Nathless he presses on,
And whirls his lightning blade, till, plunging it
Full in the shouting Rutule's face, he reft,
Dying, the foeman's life, then, pierced with wounds,
Flung him upon his lifeless friend, and there
At last lay pillowed calm in death's repose.
Ah! happy pair! if aught my verse avail,
No lapse of hours from time's recording page
Shall e'er erase you, while Aeneas' house
Dwells on the Capitol's unshaken rock,
And the great Roman sire holds sovereignty. 449
The conquering Rutules, masters of the spoil
And plunder, now with tears the breathless corse
Of Volscens bear to camp; nor in the camp
Less wild their grief for Rhamnes lifeless found,
And all those chiefs in one fell carnage slain
With Numia and Serranus. A great throng
Makes for the dead and dying, where all reeked fresh
With slaughter, and the full streams foamed with
blood.
One with another, they recognize the spoil,
Messapus' gleaming helm and trophies fair,
That cost such sweat of battle to win back. 458

Now, rising from Tithonus' saffron bed,

# THE AENEID IX

> Young Dawn was sprinkling with new beams the world;  
> In floods the sunlight, and lays all things bare.  
> When Turnus, girt in his own warlike arms,  
> Summons to arms his men, and every chief  
> Musters for battle his brass-mailed array,  
> And with a thousand rumours whets their wrath.  
> Aye, and on upraised spear-points, piteous sight!  
> They fix, and follow with loud shouts, the heads  
> Of Nisus and Euryalus. But Troy’s sons  
> Unflinching on the ramparts' leftward side  
> Have set their line of battle—for the right  
> Is girded by the river—and there guard  
> The yawning trench, and on the lofty towers  
> Stand sorrowing, moved to see on spear-heads borne  
> Those warrior-faces, known, alas! too well,  
> And dripping with dark gore.
> 
> Winged Fame the while  
> Speeds with the tidings through the affrighted town,  
> And to the mother of Euryalus  
> Comes floating in at her ear. Then, hapless one!  
> Warmth left her frame of a sudden; from both hands  
> Dashed was the shuttle, and all her task unwound.  
> Forth flies the ill-fated dame with woman’s shrieks,  
> Rent locks, and madly for the ramparts makes,  
> And foremost fighters, heedless she of men,  
> Heedless of danger and of darts, then fills  
> The heaven with lamentations: “Is it thus,  
> Euryalus, I see thee? and could’st thou,  
> Late refuge of mine age, so leave me lone?  
> Ah! cruel; and on such perilous errand sent,  
> Might thy poor mother bid thee no farewell?  
> Alas! in a strange land thou liest, a prey  
> To Latin dogs and vultures! Nor have I,  
> Thy mother, led thy funeral-pomp, or closed  
> Thine eyes, or washed thy wounds, or with the robe  
> Thee covered, which I toiled at, night and day,  
> Easing an old wife’s sorrow with the loom.  
> Say, whither can I follow, or what land now  
> Holds thy dismembered frame and mangled corse?  
> Son, bring'st me back no more of thee than this?  
> Is't this I followed over land and main?
> 
> If ye have men’s hearts, pierce me, upon me  
> Heave all your shafts, O Rutules; with the sword  
> Me first devour: or thou, great Sire of gods,  
> Have pity, and with thy bolt to Tartarus’ depth  
> Hurl this detested head, since sunder else  
> Life’s cruel yoke I may not.” With her sobs  
> All hearts were torn; a moan of anguish passed  
> From rank to rank, their valour numbed and crushed  
> For battle. As thus she fed the flame of woe,  
> Idaeus and Actor, bidden of Ilioneus  
> And tear-dissolved Iulus, in their arms  
> Caught her, and bore within.
> 
> But hark! the trump  
> Its terrible note of clanging brass afar  
> Has uttered; a shout follows, and the sky  
> Reverberates. The Volscians side by side  
> Urge the shield-tortoise onward, fain to fill  
> The trench, and rend the rampart. Others some  
> Quest for an entrance, and with scaling-gear  
> To mount the wall, there where the line was scant,  
> And the gapped circle, sparselier manned, showed thin.  
> 
> The Teucrian host with motley missile-showers  
> Meet who assail them, and stout push of pole,  
> Taught by long warfare to defend their walls.  
> Stones too of deadly weight they roll, in hope  
> The roofed ranks to shatter, though fain are these  
> All shocks to bear beneath that impervious shell.  
> Yet fail they now: for where yon mighty swarm  
> Threatens, up-roll the Teucrians and heave o’er  
> A monstrous mass, which on the Rutulian tide  
> Wrought wide havoc, and brake their coverlet of mail.  
> 
> No longer the bold Rutules care to wage  
> A blindfold war, but from the rampart strive  
> With darts to thrust them. Otherwhere, grim sight,  
> Mezentius, brandishing a Tuscan pine,  
> Hurls smoky fire-brands; while Messapus, see!  
> Tamer of horses, Neptune’s child, tears down  
> The rampart, and cries, “Ladders to the wall!”
> 
> O Calliope, inspire me, thou and thine,  
> To sing what havoc, what deaths upon that day  
> Dealt Turnus with the sword, what warrior’s life  
> Sped each to Orcus; and unroll with me  
> The mighty margins of the scroll of war.
> 
> There was a tower that strained the upward gaze,  
> With gangways high, on site of vantage set,  
> Which all of Italy strove amain to storm,  
> And toiled their utmost to o’er-topple: this  
> The Trojans were defending, armed with stones,  
> And through the loop-holes hurled their darts in showers.
> 
> Turnus first flung a blazing torch, and drave  
> Into its flank the fire, which, swollen with wind,

> Back-settling to the side which lacks the bane,  
> Suddenly, over-weighed, down fell the tower,  
> And all the welkin thundered with the crash.
> 
> Half-dead to earth they come, the monster-mass  
> Behind them, pierced alike by their own darts,  
> And with hard splinters through the breast impaled.  
> Scarce one alone, Helenor, and with him Lycus, escaped;  
> Helenor in youth’s prime, whom slave Licymnia erst  
> Had secretly borne to Maeonia’s king, and sent to Troy  
> In arms forbidden, with bare sword light-arrayed  
> And blank shield nameless. Soon as he beheld  
> About him Turnus’ thousands, with the ranks  
> Of Latium standing on this side and that,
> 
> As a wild beast that, by the huntsmen’s ring  
> Hemmed closely, storms against the darts, and leaps,  
> Eyes open, upon death, and with a bound  
> Springs on the spear-points, even so the youth  
> Midmost the foemen rushed on doom, and, where  
> He saw the darts throng thickest, aimed his way.  
> But Lycus, with his feet far doughtier, threads  
> Through foes and darts his flight, and gains the wall,  
> Fain to clutch coping and reach comrades’ hands.
> 
> Whom Turnus, following both with foot and spear,  
> Thus taunts in triumph: “Fool, thought’st thou to escape  
> My grasp?” so seized him as he clung, and tore  
> Down with a mighty fragment of the wall.
> 
> As when, with hare or snowy-bodied swan  
> Gripped in his hooked talons, soars aloft  
> Jove’s armour-bearer, or as wolf of Mars  
> Snatches a lamb from fold, with bleat on bleat  
> Sought by its mother. From every side ascends  
> The war-shout; on they press, and from the mound  
> Fill in the trenches. Others at the roofs  
> Fling blazing brands. With a huge mass of rock,  
> Torn from a mountain, Ilioneus strikes down  
> Lucetius, as with fire in hand he drew  
> Anigh the gate; Liger, Emathion,  
> Asilas, Corynaeus, with javelin that,  
> This skilled with sly-winged arrow from afar.  
> Caeneus, Ortygius, Turnus Caeneus quells,  
> Fresh from his victory; Turnus, Itys too  
> And Clonius, Dioxippus, Promolus,  
> And Sagaris, and Idas, as he stood  
> In forefront of the bulwarks; Capys slays Privernus.  
> Him Themilla’s glancing spear at first had grazed,  
> Who, madly dropping shield, laid hand on hurt; on flew  
> The winged shaft, pinned to left side his palm, probed deep,  
> And tore with murderous breach the passages of breath.
> 
> The son of Arcens stood in splendid arms  
> With needle-broidered scarf superbly dight  
> Of dark Iberian dye, for beauty famed,  
> Whom his sire Arcens to the field had sent,  
> Reared in his mother’s grove anigh the streams

> Gift-dowered and gracious: flinging spears aside,  
> Mezentius with strained thong the whizzing sling  
> Thrice whirled about his head, with molten ball  
> Cleft the mid-forehead of the opposing foe,  
> And stretched him all his length upon the sand.
> 
> Then first, ’tis said, Ascanius his swift shaft  
> Levelled in war, till now but wont to fright  
> The flying quarry, and with his hand laid low  
> The brave Numanus, surnamed Remulus,  
> To Turnus’ younger sister late-allied  
> In wedlock. He before the vanward ranks

> Stalked vainly, clamouring loud: “Ah! blush ye not,  
> Twice captured Phrygians, yet again to be  
> Cooped within rampart by the leaguer’s ring,  
> And thus to wall off death? Lo! these the men  
> Who claim our wives at the sword’s point! What god,

> 
> Not here the Atridae, nor Ulysses here  
> Tongue-trickster. Hardy and of a hardy stock,  
> Down to the river our very babes we bring,

> Our boys hunt tireless, and wear out the woods,  
> Their sport to rein the steed, stretch shaft on bow.  
> Patient of toil, to need inured, our youth  
> Tame earth with mattocks, or shake towns with war.  
> No age of life but with hard steel is worn;  
> With spear reversed our bullocks’ flanks we goad;  
> Nor sluggish eld doth our hearts’ strength impair,  
> Or warp our vigour: on white locks we press  
> The helmet-rim, and evermore delight  
> To mass new plunder and by rapine live.
> 
> Yours are embroidered robes of saffron tint,  
> Or gleaming purple; sloth is your delight;  
> Ye love to revel in the dance, and wear  
> Sleeved tunics and stringed turbans. Phrygians ye.  
> Women, indeed, not men; go, range the heights  
> Of Dindymus, where to practised touch the pipe  
> Utters its twofold note. The timbrels, hark!  
> The Idaean mother’s Berecynthian flute  
> Calls you: leave arms to men, and quit the sword.”
> 
> Such wordy boasting and loud-threatening taunts  
> Ascanius brooked not: on the horse-hair string  
> He stretched a shaft, confronting him, and drew  
> His arms apart, and stood, first praying to Jove  
> With suppliant vows: “Almighty Jupiter,  
> Smile on my bold essay. I to thy shrine  
> Will yearly offerings bring, and set a steer  
> Brow-gilded at thine altar, dazzling white,  
> His head borne level with his dam’s, now meet  
> To butt with horn and spurn with hoof the soil.”  
> The Father heard, and from a clear sky-space  
> Thundered upon the left; at once the bow  
> Twanged with its deadly freight. The shaft drawn home  
> Flew whistling grim, and borne through Remulus’ head  
> Cleft with steel barb the hollows of his brow.
> 
> “Go then, with haughty words at valour mock!  
> The twice-ta’en Phrygians to the Rutules send  
> This answer back.” Thus far Ascanius spake;  
> The Teucrians cheer responsive, shout for joy,  
> And mount in soul to heaven. It chanced that then  
> Long-haired Apollo from a tract of sky  
> Was glancing downward on the Ausonian host,  
> And city, cloud-enthroned, and thus addressed Iulus, as he triumphed:  
> “Good luck have thou of thy new valour, boy! So men mount heaven,  
> O god-descended, sire of gods to be.  
> Rightly shall all wars, doomed to rise, sink down  
> Beneath the offspring of Assaracus. Troy cannot hold thee.”
> 
> With that word he shoots from heaven on high, disparts the breathing gales,  
> And seeks Ascanius. Then his form he shifts  
> To that of aged Butes, who erewhile  
> Was armour-bearer to the Dardan chief Anchises,  
> and true warder of the gate; thereafter charged by the lad’s sire to guard Ascanius.  
> Onward then Apollo strode, like the old man in all, both voice and hue,  
> As in white locks, and fiercely-clashing arms;  
> Then thus to fiery-souled Iulus spake:
> 
> “Child of Aeneas, enough that by thy shafts  
> Numanus unavenged hath bit the dust;  
> This thy first praise doth great Apollo grant,  
> Nor grudges arms that emulate his own.  
> Cease, boy, from further warfare.” Thus began.
> 
> But in mid utterance left the eyes of men,  
> Apollo, and into empty air afar  
> Vanished from sight. The Dardan princes knew  
> The god, and his divine artillery,  
> And heard the quiver rattling as he flew.
> 
> Ascanius, eager for the fray, they check  
> With Phoebus’ word of power; themselves once more  
> Fill up the battle-ranks, and cast their lives  
> Into the yawning peril. A shout runs  
> From tower to tower, the whole wall's length; they stretch  
> Their eager bows, and whirl the javelin-thong.
> 
> Earth is all strewn with missiles; shield and helm  
> Ring hollow to their blows; fierce swells the fight;  
> Thick as a shower that, rising from the west,  
> Beneath the watery kid-stars whips the ground,  
> Or heavy as hail that headlong pelts the sea,  
> When, rough with southern blasts, the sky-god whirls  
> His watery storm, and bursts the clouds in heaven.
> 
> Pandarus and Bitias, from Alcanor sprung

> Tall as their native pines or mountain peaks,  
> Throw wide a portal to their charge consigned  
> By the chief’s word, and, on their arms relying,  
> Bid enter free the foemen through the walls.  
> Themselves within, to right hand and to left,  
> Take stand before the bulwarks, armed in iron,  
> While the plumes flutter on their towering heads.

> Even as on either side some river’s flow

> 
> At once strange light flashed from the hero’s eyes;

> Quivered blood-red, and from his shield he darts  
> Quick gleams of lightning. Suddenly dismayed,  
> The sons of Troy know well that hated form  
> And limbs gigantic. Then huge Pandarus  
> Springs from their midst, and for his brother’s death  
> Red-hot with wrath bespeaks him: “This is not

> 
> To him spake Turnus, smiling, calm at heart:  
> “Begin, if thou hast manhood, and fall on.  
> Word shalt thou bear to Priam that here too

> “Not so this weapon, my right hand wields amain,

> Aims wound or weapon.” So saying, he rises high  
> To his uplifted sword, and with the blade  
> Full betwixt either temple, a grisly stroke,  
> Cleft him through forehead and through beardless cheeks.  
> A loud crash followed; earth reels with the vast weight;  
> Rolled in a heap, with his brain-spattered arms,

> To burst the gate-bolts and let in his friends,  
> That day the war had ended, and the race.  
> But rage impelled him, and mad lust of blood  
> Like fire upon the foe. First Phaleris  
> He overtakes, and Gyges, ’neath the knee  
> Slitting his sinews. Plucking forth the spears  
> From these, he hurls them on the fliers’ backs;

> Halys to join them, and, through shield transfixed,  
> Phegeus; then, all unwitting, on the wall  
> Still kindling war, Alcander, Halius,  
> Noemon, Prytanis. As Lynceus strides  
> Forward, calls up his comrades, with one strong  
> Bright sword-sweep from the rampart on the right  
> He takes him; severed by a single stroke  
> At arm’s length, head and helm lay rolled afar.

> Then Amycus, of woodland beasts the scourge,  
> Than whom none happier-handed to anoint  
> Darts, and envenom steel, and Aeolus’ son.  
> Clytius, and Cretheus, to the Muses clear—  
> Cretheus, the Muses’ mate, who ever loved  
> Song and the lyre, and to stretch note on string,  
> And steeds and arms and battles ever sang.
> 
> At length the Teucrian leaders hear the tale  
> Of their friends’ slaughter, and together meet,  
> Mnestheus and keen Serestus; they discern  
> Friends flying wide, the foe within their gates.  
> Then Mnestheus: “Whither next, whither,” he cries,  
> “Urge ye your flight? what other walls remain,  
> What ramparts beyond these? Shall it be told  
> That one man, O my countrymen, and he  
> Hemmed by your circling lines, wrought unavenged  
> Such carnage through the camp, to Orcus hurled  
> So many of our bravest? Coward souls,  
> Your wretched country and her ancient gods,  
> And great Aeneas— do these no pity stir,

> ’Gan Turnus from the conflict to withdraw,  
> Make for the river, and wave-encircled side.
> 
> At this the Teucrians with a mighty shout  
> Press keenlier on, and form one solid mass:  
> As when a crowd with threatening spears beset  
> Some savage lion, he, terrified, yet fierce  
> And angry-eyed, recoils; valour and wrath  
> Forbid him turn aback, nor yet, though fain,  
> Through darts and huntsmen can he force his way;  
> So now doth Turnus doubtfully withdraw,  
> No hurrying steps; wrath surges in his soul.
> 
> Aye, and even then upon the foemen's midst  
> Twice had he rushed, twice turned their ranks to rout  
> Along the wall; but the whole host from camp  
> In hot haste rally and unite, nor durst  
> Saturnian Juno lend him strength enow  
> To match them; for now Jupiter from heaven  
> Sent air-borne Iris with no mild behests  
> Charged for his sister, except Turnus quit  
> The Teucrians’ lofty ramparts. So nor shield  
> Nor good right hand avails him to stand firm,  
> On every side with pelting darts o’erpowered.  
> Clatters the helm about his hollow brow  
> With ceaseless din; the solid plates of brass  
> By stones are split, the crest dashed from his head;  
> Such strokes the boss may bear not; spear on spear  
> Trojans, and Mnestheus’ self with lightning-hand,  
> Launch thick upon him. Then o’er all his frame  
> The sweat flows, pouring—and no space to breathe—  
> Its grimy torrent; a sick panting shakes  
> The o’er-wearied limbs. At length, with headlong bound,  
> Armed at all points he plunged into the flood.  
> Its tawny eddies took him, as he came,  
> Up-bore with buoyant waters, cleansed of blood,  
> And sent him back rejoicing to his friends.

Clarus and Themon at their side are ranged
From lofty Lycia. Straining his full bulk,
Lyrnesian Acmon bears a monstrous rock,
No mean part of a mountain; he, no less than Clytius, from whose loins he sprang,
Nor his own brother Mnestheus. Some with darts
Strive to ward off the foemen, some with stones,
Or hurl the firebrand, or fit shaft to string. 131
Midmost the press, for Venus’ care most meet,
Behold! the Dardan boy, his comely head
Uncovered, glitters like a gem that cleaves
The red gold round it, to deck head or throat,
Or as gleams ivory, cunningly inlaid
In boxwood or Orician terebinth:
The milk-white neck his showery locks receives
Up-gathered in a ring of pliant gold.
Thee too, O Ismarus, the great-hearted folk
C 305 3

## THE AENEID X

Saw aim the wound, and arm the reed with bane,
High-born of house Maeonian, where men till
Rich furrows by Pactolus washed with gold. 142
There too was Mnestheus, whom his late renown
In routing Turnus from the rampart's height
Exalts to heaven, and Capys there, from whom
The great Campanian city draws her name.
These in the grip of stubborn war had closed:
Aeneas was cleaving now the midnight sea.
For, from Evander parted, and arrived
The Etruscan camp, soon as he meets the king,
And to the king relates his race and name,
Boon asked or offered, and reveals what arms
Mezentius wins to aid him, and therewith
The unbridled heart of Turnus—warning him
How mutable things human, and with pleas
Mingling entreaties—without more ado
Tarchon joins forces, and strikes treaty: then
Fate-free, the Lydian folk at heaven’s behest
Beneath an alien’s banner leap aboard.
The good ship of Aeneas leads the van,
The Phrygian lions yoked beneath her prow; 757
O’er them hangs Ida, a boon sight to see
For Teucrian exiles. Great Aeneas here
Sits and revolves in his own heart the while
War’s changeful issues; to his leftward side
Cleaves Pallas, and now asks him of the stars—
The roadway of dark night—anon of all
His jeopardies endured by land and sea.
Now open Helicon, ye goddesses,
And wake the strain, what hero-company,
Following Aeneas from the Etruscan strand,
Array the decks for war, and ride the deep. 165
First, in his brass-beaked *Tiger*, Massicus
Cleaves the sea-billows, beneath whom are ranged
A thousand warriors, from walled Clusium come,
And Cosae’s city; arrowmen are they,
Girt with light quiver and death-bearing bow.
With him grim Abas, his whole band aflame
With glorious arms, Apollo gilded bright
Upon the stern. Six hundred of her sons
Had Populonia lent him, proved in war,
But Ilva’s isle three hundred, whose rich womb
Teems with the Chalybes’ unexhausted mines. 777
Third, that interpreter ’twixt gods and men,
Asilus comes, obedient to whose will

Are victims’ entrails, and the stars of heaven,
And tongues of birds, and bodeful lightning-fires.
A thousand speeds he on in close array,
And with spears bristling, to his banner bid
By Pisa, city of Alphean birth,
On soil Etruscan. Follows in their wake
Thrice beauteous Astyr, Astyr on his steed
And gay-wrought arms relying; along with him—
All of one heart to follow—hundreds three
From Caere’s home, or who in Minio’s fields
And ancient Pyrgi dwell, and fever-fraught
Graviscae.

No, nor thee must I pass o’er,
Liguria’s bravest chieftain, Cinyras,
Or thee, Cupavo, with thy scanty train,
From whose crest springs the plumage of a swan;
Love is your reproach,—for cognizance ye bear
Your father’s form. For Cycnus, as folk tell,
Bemoaning his loved Phaethon—what time
Amid those sisters’ shadowy poplar-leaves
He sings, with music solacing love’s woe—
Donned downy feathers for the snows of age,
Left earth behind, and starward soared in song.
The son, embarked with all his warlike peers,
Urges with oars the mighty *Centaur* on;
Who leans above the flood, and menaces
With monstrous rock the billows, towering high,
And furrows with long keel the watery deep.
Summons a war-host from his native shores
Great Ocnus too, from Manto, prophetess,
Sprung, and the Tuscan river, who to thee
Gave walls, O Mantua, and his mother’s name,
Mantua now rich in noble sires, but not
All of one stock; a threefold race are they,
Four several States in each; o’er all the States
Herself the head, her strength of Tuscan blood.
Hence too Mezentius arms to his own bane
Five hundred, whom the form of Mincius, crowned
With grey-green rushes, sire Benacus’ child,
Was seaward leading in their pine of war.
Aulestes labouring onward smites the flood
With hundred tree-stems rising to the stroke;
The sea-floor is upchurned, the waters foam.
Him monstrous Triton bears, and with his shell
Frights the blue billows; downward to the flank
His shaggy front shows human, as he swims;

## THE AENEID X

Ends in a fish the belly; ’neath his waist
Half bestial the wave gurgles as it foams.
Such was the tale of chosen chiefs who came
In thrice ten vessels to the aid of Troy,
Cleaving with brass the fields of brine. 215
And now
Kind Phoebe, daylight from the sky withdrawn,
Smote mid-Olympus with night-wandering car:
Aeneas, for care denied his limbs repose,
Sole sitting, guides the helm and tends the sails;
When a fair band of once his wayfellows
See! meet him in mid course: the nymphs, whom kind
Cybebe bade have worship of the sea,
And turned to nymphs from vessels, toward him swam,
Cleaving the floods together, each and all
That had as brazen prows stood moored to shore. 223
Their king they know from far, with solemn dance
Surround him; but their skillfullest of speech,
Cymodocea, following in his wake,
Grasps with her right the stern, shoots shoulder-high,
And with her left hand oars the silent wave.
Then thus she accosts him, though he knew not her:
> “Wakest thou, son of heaven, Aeneas? Wake
> And slack the sail-sheets. Lo! thy fleet are we,
> Pine-trees of Ida from his sacred crest,
> Now ocean-nymphs. When us the Rutule false
> With sword and fire urged headlong, we thy bonds
> Unwilling snapped, and seek thee o'er the main.
> The mighty Mother, pitying, this our form
> Rewrought, and gave us to be goddesses,
> And under ocean all our days to spend. 235
> But young Ascanius wall and trench confine
> ’Mid Latium’s darts and bristling front of war.
> Idle Arcadian horse and stout Etruscan stand
> Even now together at the appointed spot.
> With interposing host to block their path,
> And bar from camp, is Turnus’ set resolve. 240
> Up then! at earliest dawn bid rouse to arms
> Thy friends, and take the shield, the lord of fire
> Gave thee himself, of adamantine might,
> And edged the rims with gold. Tomorrow’s sun,
> If vain my words thou deem not, shall descry
> Vast heaps of Rutule slaughter.” She had said,
And with her right hand pushed the lofty stern
At parting, nowise witless of the way
I 308

## THE AENEID X

Swifter than javelin, or wind-winged shaft,
It skims along the waves; thereat the rest
Quicken their course. The Trojan prince himself,
Son of Anchises, stands amazed, yet takes
Heart from the omen; then, with eyes upturned
To the high vault of heaven, he briefly prays:
> “Kind queen of Ida, mother of the gods,
> Whom Dindymus, and cities turret-crowned,
> And lions coupled to thy rein, delight,
> Be thou my guide in battle, and this sign
> Bring to fair issue, and with favouring foot
> Attend the Phrygians, goddess.’ There he ceased.
Meanwhile returning dawn sped round apace,
To broad day ripening, and had banished night:
First to his comrades he gives charge that all
Obey the signal, brace their hearts to war,
And fit them for the fray. And now he holds
The Teucrian host and his own camp in sight,
Upon the high poop standing: suddenly
On his left arm the blazing shield he rears.
The Dardans from the wall raise shouts to heaven;
Hope comes to heighten wrath; their darts they shower;
As cranes from Strymon under murky clouds
Give signal, and skim clamorously the air,
And scud before the south with trailing cry. 257
But to the Rutule prince right marvellous,
And to Ausonia’s captains, seemed the thing,
Till, looking back, the vessels’ stems they spy
Turned shoreward, the whole main one moving fleet. 269
Blazes yon helm-top; from the crest above
Spouts fire; the gold boss belches floods of flame:
As on a clear night glows the baleful glare
Of blood-red comets, or as Sirius’ heat,
Fraught with disease and drought for suffering men,
Rises, and saddens heaven with light malign.
Yet bates not gallant Turnus his bold hope
To seize the shore and beat the invaders back. 277
> “Here is the hap ye prayed for, word in hand
> To shatter them. The war-god’s very self
> Is in the hands of heroes. Now let each
> Of wife and home be mindful, now recall
> The great deeds and the glories of your sires.
> Up! let us meet them at the brink, while yet
> Confused and tottering, as their feet touch land.
> Fortune befriends the bold.” So saying, he mused
C 309 3

## THE AENEID X

Inly whom best to lead against the foe,
Or to whose charge the leaguered walls confide. 286
Meanwhile, with gangways from each lofty stern
Aeneas unships his comrades. Many wait
The slack sea’s ebb, and hazard a bold leap
Into the shallows; some with aid of oars.
Tarchon espies a beach where shoals nor pant,
Nor roars the broken billow, but unchecked
Ocean glides onward with advancing tide—
Anon steers thither, and calls upon his men: 293
> “Now, chosen crews, bend to your sturdy oars,
> Lift and bear in the barks; cleave with their beaks
> This hostile land, and let the keel’s sheer weight
> Plough its own furrow. In such a roadstead I
> Shrink not from shipwreck, once we clutch the shore.”
So Tarchon spake, and all his mates at once
Rise on their oar-blades, and to Latium’s plain
Bear in the foaming vessels, till their beaks
Now grip the dry, and every keel anon
Lies safely bedded; but not, Tarchon, thine:
For, dashed amid the shallows, while she hangs
Upon a treacherous ridge, long poised in doubt,
And wearies out the waves, she splits, and casts
Her crew among the billows; broken oars
And floating thwarts entangle them, their feet
The while dragged backward by the water’s ebb. 307
No laggard sloth checks Turnus; swift he hurls
His whole line at the Teucrians, on the beach
Halts, and confronts them. Then the trumpets sound.
First leapt Aeneas on the rustic ranks—
Fair augury of fight—and trampled down
The Latins, and slew Theron, mightiest-thewed,
Who dared assault Aeneas. The sword driven
Through links of brass, through tunic stiff with gold,
Drank of his gaping side. And next he strikes
Lichas, once ripped from his dead mother’s womb,
And sacred to thee, Phoebus, as a babe
Suffered to ’scape the perils of the steel.
And rugged Cisseus, and huge Gyas, too,
While levelling with their clubs the ranks hard by,
He smote to death; no whit might these bestead
The arms of Hercules, or their stout hands,
And sire Melampus, erst Alcides’ mate,
Long as earth yielded him his travails sore.
While Pharus, see! flings deedless words abroad,

## THE AENEID X

The hero brandishes and plants a spear
Full in his bawling mouth. Thou, Cydon, too,
In luckless quest of Clytius, thy new joy,
The young down yellowing on his cheek, hadst lain
Stretched ’neath the Dardan’s hand, a piteous sight,
Heedless of youthful loves, thy lifelong care,
Had not thy brethren, a close-banded throng,
Offspring of Phorcus, crossed the foeman’s path.
Their number seven, and seven the darts they fling:
From shield and helmet some bound idly back,
Some, by kind Venus turned aside, his limbs
Graze merely. Then Aeneas thus bespeaks
Trusty Achates:
> “Bring me store of darts;
> None of all those shall my right hand for naught
> Launch at the Rutules, which on Ilium’s plain
> In Grecian flesh stood planted.” Therewithal
A mighty spear he grasps and hurls; it flew,
And shattering through the brass of Maeon’s shield,
Cleaves plate alike and breast. To his brother’s aid
Up comes Alcanor, props him, as he falls,
With right hand brotherly; but through his arm
The spear, sped onward, wins its bloody way,
And from his shoulder by the sinews, lo!
The hand hung dying. Then, from his brother’s corse
Snatching the weapon, Numitor assails
Aeneas, yet might not strike him full, and grazed
Tail-limbed Achates on the thigh. Thereat
Clausus of Cures, in his youthful frame
Trusting, drew near, and with a javelin-cast
Smote Dryops ’neath the chin, and, urging home
The tough shaft, pierced his throat, and in mid-speech
Reft life and voice; his forehead strikes the earth,
And from his lips he vomits out thick gore. 349
Three, too, from Thrace, of Boreas’ lofty line,
And three, by their sire Idas sent to war,
And Ismarus their country, he lays low
By divers deaths. Halaesus to the fray
Hastes with the bands Auruncan, and up-speeds
Messapus, child of Neptune, steed-renowned.
Now these, now those, strive to fling back the foe,
And on Ausonia’s very verge contend.
As in the vast of air when wrangling winds
Rise to do battle, matched in wrath and might,
None to the other yields, wind, cloud, or sea,
Long sways the combat, all stand locked in strife:
So Trojan ranks and Latin, each with each
Clash; foot to foot clings, and man crowds on man. 361
But yonder, where a torrent far and wide
Had sent rocks rolling and torn bush from bank,
When Pallas his Arcadians saw, unused
To foot encounter, fly the hot pursuit
Of Latium—for the rough ground counselled them
Their steeds to abandon—now with prayers, and now
With taunting words, sole refuge in his strait,
He fires their courage:
> “Whither fly ye, friends?
> By your brave deeds, by Chief Evander’s name
> And his triumphant wars—aye, by the hope
> That springs in me to match my sire’s renown—
> Trust not to flight. It is the sword must cleave
> Through foes our passage. Where yon warrior-throng
> Press thickest, your proud country calls you back,
> Pallas to lead you. No gods bear us down;
> Mortals by mortals are we driven, who yet
> Boast lives and hands as many. Behold! the deep
> With its vast bar confines us, and land fails
> For flight: Shall ocean be our aim, or Troy?” 338
So saying, he dashed amid the hostile press.
First meets him Lagus, led by fates malign,
Whom, tugging at a huge and ponderous stone,
With javelin hurled he pierces, where the spine
Twixt ribs and ribs made severance, and plucks back
His weapon whence it clave amid the bones.
Yet Hisbo from above surprised him not,
Though surely hoping; for, as on he rushed,
Blinded with rage for his friend’s bitter fate,
Pallas forestalls him, in his swollen lung
Plunging the sword-blade. Next on Sthenius
He hurls him, and Anchemolus, derived
From Rhoetus’ ancient stem, who dared defile
His stepdame’s bridal chamber. And ye, too,
Twin sons of Daucus, on the Rutule plain
Fell, Thymber and Larides, wearing both
One likeness, e’en to your own parents’ eyes
A sweet insoluble perplexity. 392
But bitter difference now hath Pallas wrought
Betwixt ye; for thy head the Evandrian sword
Hath shorn, O Thymber, and thy lopped right hand
Gropes for its lord, Larides, and half-quick
The fingers quiver, and clutch the sword anew.
Fired by the hero’s chiding, and at sight
Of his resplendent deeds, ’twixt rage and shame

## THE AENEID X

The Arcadians steel their hearts to face the foe.
Then Pallas pierces Rhoeteus as he sped
Past in his chariot. Respite and delay
Thus much gat Ilus: for at Ilus he
Had aimed a doughty javelin from afar;
But Rhoeteus, intercepting it midway,
From thee, right noble Teuthras, as he fled,
And from thy brother Tyres, rolled from car,
Hammers with dying heel the Rutule plain. 405
As, at his wish, when summer winds have risen,
Some shepherd fires the forest here and there;
All in a moment the mid spaces catch,
And o’er the wide plains in unbroken line
Sweeps the grim-flickering edge of Vulcan’s war—
He, perched triumphant, marks the revelling flame—
So all thy comrades wax in valour one,
And glad thee, Pallas. But to meet them moves
Halaesus, brave in onset, the whole man
Behind his shield up-gathered, and hews down
Ladon and Pheres and Demodocus; 415
Strymonius’ right hand, raised against his throat,
With flashing blade he shears, then smites with a rock
The face of Thoas, and batters in the bones,
Blood mixed with brain. Halaesus in the woods
Had by his prophet-sire been hid; when now
The old man's eyes failed and were glazed in death,
Fates claim their own, and to Evander’s darts
Devote the son. At him now Pallas aimed,
First praying thus:
> “O father Tiber, grant
> Now to this weapon, which I poise for fight,
> A prosperous way through stout Halaesus’ heart;
> So shall thine oak his arms and spoils possess.” 423
This heard the god; Halaesus, while he shields
Imaon, to the Arcadian dart lays bare
His luckless breast. But Lausus, of the fight
Main champion, brooks not that his ranks be scared
By all the hero’s slaughter: at their head
Encountering he slays Abas, a tough knot
And barrier of the battle. Then goes down
Arcadia’s manhood, down the Etruscans go,
And ye, whose frames defied the slaughtering Greeks,
O Teucrians! Matched in leaders, as in might,
Host rushes upon host. The rearward ranks
Close up and crowd the battle, hand and spear
Wedged beyond wielding. Here is Pallas, see,
Pressing and straining, there, confronting him,
I 313 1

## THE AENEID X

Lausus, in age his equal, both alike
Peerless in beauty, but by fortune’s ban
Doomed to no home-return. Yet were they not
Suffered by great Olympus’ lord to close
In conflict; each beneath a mightier foe
Waits his impending destiny. 438
Meanwhile
His gracious sister now bids Turnus bring
Relief to Lausus; and on flying car
He cleaves the ranks between them. When his friends
He spied,
> “Ho now! cease fighting; I alone
> Go to meet Pallas! Pallas is my due,
> Mine only: fain were I his sire himself
> Stood here to see.” So spake he, and his friends
Withdrew them from the space proclaimed. But when
The Rutules had made room, the noble youth,
Much marvelling at the haughty mandate, stares
Amazed at Turnus, over the vast frame
Lets roll his eyes, and with fierce glance afar
Scans him at every point, then, speech for speech,
Makes answer to the monarch:
> “Now shall I
> Be praised as winner of the splendid spoils,
> Or for a famous death; and either fate
> My sire can face. Away with threats.” So saying,
He strides into the arena’s midst. About
The Arcadian’s heart-strings the blood curdles cold. 432
Turnus has leapt from chariot, and on foot
Prepares for close encounter. As a lion,
That from his lofty outlook hath espied
A bull far off, erect upon the plain
Brooding on battle, flies upon the prey,
Even such the look of Turnus as he came.
But Pallas, when he deemed the foe would be
Now within spear-cast, hastens to begin,
So some kind hap might help the bold essay
Of ill-matched powers: then thus to the great heaven
He cries:
> “By my sire’s welcome, and the board
> Whereto thou cam’st a stranger, I thee pray,
> Alcides, aid me in my vast emprise. 461
> Let him behold me from his limbs yet quick
> Strip off the blood-stained arms, and Turnus’ eyes,
> Dying, endure a conqueror.” The youth’s prayer
Alcides heard, and, stifling a deep groan
Within his heart, shed unavailing tears.
Then with kind words the Sire bespake his son:
> “Each hath his term appointed; brief the span
> Of all men's life, and irretrievable;
> But by great feats to lengthen fame, here lies
> The task of valour. 'Neath Troy's lofty walls
> Fell many a god-begotten; nay, with them
> Perished Sarpedon, mine own offspring. Aye,
> And Turnus his fates summon, now arrived
> The goal of age allotted.” Thus he spake,
And from the Rutule plain his eyes withdrew. 475
But Pallas launches with main strength a spear,
And plucks from hollow sheath his flashing sword.
On flew the shaft, and, where the shoulder-plates
Rose to their highest, lit, and forced its way
Through the shield’s edges, and glanced off at length
Even from the mighty frame of Turnus. Then
Turnus, long poising a steel-pointed spear,
Hurls it at Pallas, crying,
> “Look you now
> Whether my dart pierce deeper.” He had said,
But crashing through the centre of the shield—
Iron upon iron welded, brass on brass,
Wound all about with bull’s hide manifold—
With quivering impact the point tore, and pierced
The corslet's barrier and the mighty breast.
He plucks the warm dart from the wound in vain; 486
Outburst one way the life-blood and the life;
Prone on the wound he sinks, and over him
Loud clanged his armour, as the dying lips,
Blood-dabbled, smote upon the foeman’s soil.
Then, standing o’er him, Turnus spake and said:
> “Arcadians, heed, and to Evander's ear
> Bear this my message: say that, in such plight
> As he hath earned him, I send Pallas home.
> What grace a grave, what solace burial hath,
> Freely I grant. Right dearly will he rue
> His welcome of Aeneas.” Thus he spake,
And with his left foot pressed the lifeless corse,
Seizing the belt's vast burden, with the crime
Engraved there—in one nuptial night a band
Of youths slain foully, and the bride-bower drenched
In blood; which Clonus, son of Eurytus,
Had traced upon thick gold: but of the prize
Turnus now boasts him, glorying in the spoil. 500
Ah! mind of man, to fate and coming doom
Blind, and that knows no bridle, when elate
With prosperous fortune! there shall come a time
When Turnus fain at a great price would buy
315 n

## THE AENEID X

Pallas back scathless, and will yon proud spoils
Loathe, and the day he won them. But his friends
With many a groan and tear throng round and set
Pallas on shield, and bear him from the fray.
O grief and mighty glory to thy sire
Anon returning! This one day begins
And ends alike thy warfare; none the less
Huge heaps of Rutule dead thou leav’st behind. 505
Now no mere rumour of so dear a loss,
But weightier witness to Aeneas hies;
His friends but a bare span from death, ’tis time
Troy’s routed ranks to succour. With the sword
He reaps what’s nearest, and through serried foes,
Like fire, a wide path hews him, thee to seek,
Turnus, exulting in new deeds of blood.
Pallas, Evander—on his very eyes
Flashed the whole scene, the board whereto he came
Then first, a stranger, and the pledged right hands.
Four warriors hereupon from Sulmo sprung,
As many reared by Ufens, he takes quick,
To slay as offerings to the shade, and drench
The blazing funeral-pyre with captive blood. 520
Next from afar at Magus he had aimed
A deadly spear. But he comes crouching up
Slily, while o’er him the shaft quivering flew,
Then clasped the hero’s knees, and suppliant spake:
> “By thy sire’s soul, I pray thee, by thy hopes
> Ripening with young Iulus, spare my life
> For son and sire. A stately house have I,
> Where talent-weights of silver fair-embossed
> Lie buried deep, and massy gold is mine,
> Wrought and unwrought. Nor hinges hereupon
> The Teucrians’ triumph, nor one life alone
> Can work so vast a difference.” He had said.
To whom Aeneas thus spake in answer:
> “All
> Thy boasted store of silver and of gold
> Save for thy sons. Such trafficking in arms
> Turnus forecancelled in that hour when he
> Smote Pallas dead. So deems among the shades
> My sire Anchises, and Iulus so.” 537
He spake, and with his left hand grasped the helm,
And bending the neck backward, as he prayed,
Plunged in his sword-blade to the hilt. Hard by
The son of Haemon, priest of Phoebus, stood,
And Trivia, chapleted about the brow
With sacred fillet-bands, from head to heel
N 316

## THE AENEID X

One splendour of white raiment, glittering arms.
Him then he meets, and drives adown the plain,
Stands o’er him slipped and fallen, and slaughters him,
And in vast darkness whelms. The warrior’s arms,
Up-gathered, Serestus shoulders and bears off,
Trophy to thee, Gradivus, lord of war. 542
Now Caeculus, from the stock of Vulcan sprung,
And Umbro who from Marsian mountains came,
Repair the battle-ranks. Against them storms
The Dardan. With the sword he had lopped off
Anxur’s left arm, and, with the arm, his shield’s
Whole circle; the man had uttered some big boast,
And thought with deed to match it, and belike
Was even exalting his proud soul to heaven
With promise of hoar eld and length of days; 549
When, in bright arms exulting, Tarquitus,
Whom Dryope the nymph erewhile had borne
To woodland Faunus, crossed his fiery path.
He, drawing back his spear, pins fast in one
The corslet and huge burden of his shield;
Then, as he vainly prays, with many a word
Still ripe for utterance, hurled to earth his head,
And, rolling in the dust the yet warm trunk,
In bitter mood spake o’er it:
> “Now lie there,
> Redoubted warrior! no kind mother’s hand
> In earth shall hide thee, or heap above thy limbs
> Ancestral soil: but to the ravenous birds
> Shalt thou be left, or gulf shall drown and wave
> Bear thee, and hungry fishes lip thy wounds.” 560
Antaeus next and Lucas, foremost ranks
Of Turnus, he o’ertakes, and Numa brave,
And tawny Camers, noble Volscens’ son,
Richest in land of all Ausonia’s folk,
Who ruled in hushed Amyclae. Even as when
Aegeon, fabled of a hundred arms,
A hundred hands, and from whose fifty mouths
And breasts blazed fire, against the bolts of Jove
Clashed on like shields as many, as many swords
Drew; so Aeneas over the wild plain
Rages his fill victoriously, when once
His blade waxed warm. Nay see! he moves to meet
Niphaeus’ four-horse team and threatening front. 571
Soon as they saw him striding with huge steps,
And fiercely muttering, the steeds wheeled for fear,
I 317

## THE AENEID X

Rushed backward, and flung forth their lord, and whirled
The chariot shore-ward. Lucagus meanwhile
With twain white war-steeds dashed amid the throng,
He and his brother Liger; Liger reins
And guides the horses; Lucagus waves fierce
His circling sword-blade. Their so fiery rage
Aeneas brooked not, but upon them rushed,
Towering conspicuous with opposing spear. 579
To whom spake Liger:
> “Here dost thou behold
> Nor Diomede's coursers, nor Achilles’ car,
> Nor Phrygia’s plain: the last of war and life
> Now on this soil awaits thee.” Such wild words
Fly from mad Liger’s lips. But not in words
Troy’s hero shapes his answer; at the foe
A dart he launches; and when Lucagus
Low-leaning, as to smite them, with the steel
His team had chidden, and now, left foot advanced,
Plants him for battle, through the nether rims
Of his bright buckler entering, the spear pierced
His groin to leftward: tumbled from the car
Dying, he rolls upon the plain. To whom
In bitter accents good Aeneas spake: 591
> “Thy chariot, Lucagus, no coward flight
> Of steeds betrayed, nor foe-flung shadows vain
> Turned backward; leaping from the wheels, thyself
> The car forsak’st.” So saying, he caught the team.
Down from the chariot, stretching helpless hands,
Slid too the unhappy brother:
> “By thyself,
> And by the twain who framed thee that thou art,
> Great Trojan, leave me life, and to my plaint
> Lend pitying ear.” Yet more he would have prayed,
When thus Aeneas:
> “Not such the words erewhile
> Thou uttered’st. Die, nor brother be divorced
> From brother.” Thereat with the sword’s point his breast
He cleaves, and lets the life-breath from its lair. 601
Thus through the plain the Dardan chief dealt death,
Raging like torrent-wave or black typhoon.

## The Aeneid X

At length the young *Ascanius* and his host
Break forth, quit camp, and foil the leaguer’s ring.

Meanwhile to *Juno* thus high *Jove* begins:

“O sister mine and sweetest wife in one,
’Tis *Venus*, as thou deemed’st—nor errs aught
Thy judgment—who upholds the power of *Troy*,
Not warrior’s right hand, throbbing for the fray,
Nor fiery soul that can all danger dare.”

Quoth *Juno* meekly: “Wherefore, fairest lord,
Vex a sick heart, of thy stern words afeared?
Had but my love that power it boasted once,
And still should boast, I had not asked in vain
Of thine omnipotence to grant me this—
Leave to filch *Turnus* from the fight, and keep
Unscathed for *Daunus*, for his sire. But now
Even let him perish, and with that loyal blood
Pay forfeit to the *Teucrians*. He nathless
Draws from the stock of heaven his name, and springs
Fourth from *Pilumnus*; and his lavish hand
Hath oft thy threshold heaped with bounteous gifts.”

Briefly to her spake high *Olympus’* lord:
“If but from present death reprieve be asked,
And respite for the warrior, ere he fall,
And thou perceiv’st I rule it so, bear hence
Away, pluck *Turnus* from the impending fate;
Such scope is mine to pleasure thee. But if
There lurk beneath thy prayer some ampler boon,
As deeming that the war’s whole course may shift
And suffer change, thou feed’st an empty hope.”

And *Juno* answered weeping: “What and if
Thy heart vouchsafed me what thy lips deny,
And pledged this loan of *Turnus’* life to last?
Now, some dread end awaits him innocent,
Or I drift void of truth. Yet O to be
By false fear cheated, and that thou, who canst,
Wouldst bend thy course to better!” Having said,
Forthwith she darted from the welkin’s height,
And trailing storm through heaven, and girt in cloud,
Sought *Ilium’s* army and *Laurentum’s* camp.

Then out of hollow mist the goddess shapes
A shade, thin, void of strength, in semblance like
*Aeneas*—a monstrous marvel to behold—
Decks it with *Dardan* gear, and counterfeits
The shield, the horse-plume of the godlike head,
Gives unreal words, gives sound devoid of soul,
And mocks the very motions of his stride;
Like phantoms that, folk say, flit after death,
Or visions that befool the slumbering sense.

Now in the van of battle stalks the shade
Exulting, with its weapons goads the foe,
With shouts defies him. *Turnus* rushes on’t,
And hurls from far a hissing spear; the shape
Wheels and retires. But *Turnus*, when he deemed
*Aeneas* fled back, and with bewildered soul
Drank the delusive hope, cries: “Whither fly’st,
*Aeneas*? Quit not thy plighted bridal-bower:
The soil, thou hast crossed the waterways to find,
This hand shall yield thee.” With such clamorous shouts
He follows, and brandishes his naked blade,
Nor marks the light winds bear his boast away.

Fast by a tall rock’s base there chanced to stand
A vessel with steps set and gangway geared,
Which King *Osinius* bare from *Clusium’s* coast.
Hither the mock *Aeneas* hurrying fled,
And plunged for shelter; nor at slacker speed
*Turnus* pursues, treads all that stays him down,
Clears the high bridge, and scarce had touched the prow,
Ere *Saturn’s* daughter rends the rope, and speeds
O’er back-rolled billows the shore-sundered ship.

*Aeneas* meanwhile defies a vanished foe,
And many a warrior-frame that crossed his path
Sends death-ward. For no further shelter then
Seeks the light phantom, but took wing aloft,
And with a dark cloud mingled: the rough blast
Meanwhile bears *Turnus* through the billows’ midst.
Blind to the cause, unthankful for escape,
Backward he gazes, and lifts high his voice
With hands up-clasped to heaven: “Almighty Sire,
Hast deemed me worthy of reproach so deep,
To pay such forfeit doomed me? Whither bound?
Whence came I hither? What land in such guise
Wafts me from shore? Shall I again behold
*Laurentum’s* camp and bulwarks? What of those
Brave hearts, the followers of my sword and me?
Whom one and all—ah, horror!—I have left
To nameless butchery, yea, can see them now
Rank-scattered, and hear groaning as they fall?
What must I do? What land now deep enough
Can gape to hide me? Rather do ye winds
Take pity, and drive the ship on reef, on rock—
I, *Turnus*, from my heart implore—or cast
On cruel quicksands, where no *Rutule* foot,
Nor rumour that knows all, may track me out.”

So saying, his soul rocks this way, and rocks that,
Whether upon his sword, so deep the shame,
Madly to hurl him, and ’twixt rib and rib
Drive the stern blade, or plunge amid the seas,
So swimming gain the curved beach, and fall
Once more upon the *Teucrians*. Either way
Thrice he essayed; thrice, pitiful of heart,
Great *Juno* checked and held him. The ship skims
Cleaving the deep, and, sped by tide and wave,
To his sire *Daunus’* ancient town is borne.

Fiery *Mezentius* now by *Jove’s* behest
Takes up the battle, and falls upon *Troy’s* host
Amidst their triumph. The *Etruscan* ranks
Rally together, and on him alone,
Alone on him, with gathered fury press,
And showering missiles. Even as a rock,
That juts far out into the mighty main,
Bare to wind’s brunt, a target for the sea,
All stress, all menace both of sky and deep
Outfaces, fixed abiding; so to earth
He strikes down *Hebrus*, *Dolichaon’s* son,
And *Latagus*, and *Palmus* as he fled;
But *Latagus* full in face and mouth surprised
With a huge fragment of hill-rock he smote;
Hamstrung and helpless he let *Palmus* sprawl,
And gave the arms to *Lausus*, on his back
To wear them, in his helm to fix the crest:
*Phrygian Euanthes* too, and *Mimas*, whom,
Once friend of *Paris* and his peer in age,
*Theano* bare to *Amycus* his sire.
The selfsame night that *Cisseus’* royal child
Teemed with a firebrand, and gave *Paris* birth.
*Paris* within his father’s city lies,
*Mimas*, unknown, *Laurentum’s* coast doth keep.

Lo! as a mighty boar, by sharp-toothed hounds
Driven from the mountain-heights, which many a year
Pine-fruitful *Vesulus* hath sheltering held,
Many *Laurentum’s* marsh-land, pastured fair
Within her reedy jungle, he, once come
Amid the meshes, halts with angry grunt,
And bristles up his shoulders; none durst rage
Against him, or draw nearer; at safe range
With darts and shouts they harass him from far;
He, dauntless, slowly to this side and that
Turns with teeth gnashing, and shakes off the spears:
So, of all those who burned with righteous wrath
Against *Mezentius*, none durst draw the sword
And close in onset, but with deafening shouts
And far-sped shafts assail him. There had come
From the ancient bounds of *Corythus* a *Greek*,
*Acron*, who, leaving half-done marriage rites,
Had fled away; him seeing from afar
Amid the ranks deal havoc, gay with plumes,
And in the purple of his plighted bride—
As oft-times, ranging the deep forest-lairs,
An unfed lion, by mad hunger urged,
If haply he hath spied a fleet-foot goat,
Or towering-antlered stag, exults and opes
His monstrous jaws, uprears his mane, and hangs
Over the rent flesh, couching; the foul gore
Drenches his cruel mouth—so eagerly
Upon the foemen’s mass *Mezentius* leaps.

Down goes the hapless *Acron*, with his heels
Hammers the dark earth, dying, and stains red
The splintered spear-shaft. He too deigned not smite
*Orodes* flying, nor deal him a blind blow
With javelin-cast, but meets him face to face,
And man to man encounters, by no stealth
Filching the vantage, but sheer force of arms.
Then, on the prostrate foe with foot and spear
Pressing, he spake: “Here tall *Orodes* lies,
My men, no paltry portion of the war.”
His comrades after him glad paean raise.

With ebbing breath the other: “Whoe’er thou art,
Not unavenged I fall, nor long shalt thou
Enjoy thy victory; for thee, too, like fates
Are watching; the same fields thou soon shalt press.”
To whom *Mezentius*, with wrath-mingled smile:
“Now die; the Sire of gods and King of men
Shall look to me.” So saying, he drew the spear
From out the hero’s body; stern repose
And iron slumber on his eyelids press,
And their orbs close in everlasting night.

*Caedicus* then cuts down *Alcathous*;
*Sacrator* slays *Hydaspes*; *Rapo’s* sword
Falls on *Parthenius* and the knotty strength
Of *Orses*; *Clonius* by *Messapus* dies
With *Lycaonian Ericetes*, one
Stretched prone by stumbling of his reinless steed,
One foot to foot confronting him. Forth stood
*Agis* the *Lycian* too, whom *Valerus*
Nathless, naught lacking of ancestral worth,
Smote to the dust; then *Thronius* by the hand
Of *Salius*; *Salius* by *Nealces* falls,
For javelin and far-stealing arrow famed.
Fell *Maeon* now was meting forth to each
Like dole and mutual death; both equally
Victors, both vanquished, slew and fell, nor thought
Of flight had either. In *Jove’s* hall the gods
Of these and those the fruitless rage lament,
And that poor mortals should such toils endure.
*Venus* on one side gazes, and on one
*Saturnian Juno*. Pale *Tisiphone*
Raves on amid their thousands on the plain.

But now *Mezentius*, shaking his huge spear,
Into the field strides stormily; and lo!
Vast as *Orion* when he cleaves a path,
Wading through middle *Nereus’* mightiest pools,
And with his shoulder tops the waves, or when,
Bearing an aged ash from mountain-height,
He stalks on earth, and hides his head in cloud—
So strode *Mezentius* onward, vast in arms.

*Aeneas* adown the line of battle spies,
And moves to meet him. He his noble foe
Dauntless abides, and plants his ponderous bulk;
Then, measuring with his eyes a spear-throw’s space:
“Now let my right hand’s godhead and the dart
I poise for flight bestead me! Here I vow
To make thee, *Lausus*, thee, a living man,
Arrayed in spoils torn from the robber’s corse,
My trophy of *Aeneas*.” He had said,
And hurled from hand a hissing spear; it flew,
And glanced from off the shield, and pierced afar
Noble *Antores* betwixt side and loin—
*Antores*, friend of *Hercules*, who, sent
From *Argos*, to *Evander* clave, and found
Beneath *Italian* walls a home. But ah!
Smit by another’s wound he lies, and looks
On heaven, and, dying, of his dear *Argos* dreams.

Then good *Aeneas* hurls a spear; it sped
Right through the hollow disk of threefold brass,
Through layers of linen, and the inwoven work
Of triple bull’s hide, and lodged low i’ the groin,
But pushed not home its passage. Swiftly then
*Aeneas* drew sword, rejoicing to behold
The *Tuscan’s* blood, forth plucks it from his thigh,
And hotly presses on the staggering foe.
*Lausus* for love of his dear sire groaned deep
At sight of it, and tears rolled o’er his face.

Nor here thy piteous doom, thy matchless deeds,
If length of time e’er make believable
Such exploit, nor thyself, brave youth, right meet
To be remembered, will I leave unsung.
He, thus defenceless and sore hampered, now
Was back retiring, trailing from his shield
The foeman’s dart; forth leapt the youth, and thrust
Betwixt their points, and, as *Aeneas’* right hand
Now rose to strike, ran in beneath his sword,
And, hindering, stayed the striker. Loud his folk
Cheer him, and follow with their eyes, until
The sire, son-shielded, might win safe retreat,
And hurl their javelins, and bear back the foe
With darts from far. *Aeneas* storms with rage,
And keeps shield-covered. As, when with boisterous hail
The clouds fall headlong, plough-folk, every one,
And country hinds fly scattered from the fields,
And cowers the wayfarer in some safe hold,
Or river-bank, or high o’er-arching rock,
While rain still pelts the earth, that they may task
The daylight with returning sunshine: so
*Aeneas*, overwhelmed with countless darts, endures
The war-cloud, till it growl itself away,
Still chiding *Lausus*, threatening *Lausus*: “Why
Rush upon death, and overdare thy strength?
Love fools thee into rashness.” Not the less
Madly he riots, till in the *Dardan* chief
Fierce wrath rose headier, and the sister-Fates
*Lausus’* last threads up-gather; for now drives
*Aeneas* his strong sword through the stripling’s frame
Till the whole blade is buried. His light shield,
Frail arms for one so threatening, the point pierced,
And pierced the tunic which of pliant gold
His mother wove him, and blood filled his breast;
Then life, regretful, on its airy way
Fled to the shades, and left the body lone.

But when he saw the dying look and face,
The face so wondrous pale, *Anchises’* son
Uttered a deep groan, pitying him, and stretched
His right hand forth as in his soul there rose
The likeness of the love he bore his sire.
“Poor boy! what guerdon for thy glorious deeds—
Say what, to match that mighty heart of thine,
Shall good *Aeneas* yield thee? Those thine arms,
Wherein thou gloried’st, keep them; and thyself,
If such a care may touch thee, to the shades
And ashes of thy fathers I restore.
Unhappy! yet for thy sad end some balm
Be this: by great *Aeneas* thou art slain.”

Then hails he his attendants, chiding them
For loiterers, and uplifts their lord from earth,
Where he lay dabbling his trim locks with blood.
Meanwhile the sire by *Tiber’s* stream now staunched
His wounds with water, and for ease lay propped
Against a tree-trunk. On the boughs apart
Hangs the brass helmet, and his ponderous arms
Rest on the meadow-sward. About him stand
His flower of war; he panting and in pain
Foments his neck, and lets the flowing beard
O’erspread his bosom, many a time inquires
Of *Lausus*, and oft sends to call him back,
And bear the lad his sorrowing sire’s command.
But *Lausus*, laid on shield, a lifeless corse,
His friends in tears were bearing—mighty soul
Quelled by a mighty wound. The father’s heart,
Ill-boding, recognized their wail afar.
With showers of dust his hoary locks he soils,
And spreads both hands to heaven, and clasps his arms
About the corse. “Did then such joy of life
Possess me, O my son, that in my stead
I suffered thee, even thee whom I begat,
To meet the foeman’s stroke? Am I, thy sire,
Saved through thy wounds, and living by thy death?
Ah! to my sorrow now at last I know
What exile is! now is the wound pushed home.
Yea, and I too with infamy, my son,
Thy name have spotted, by men’s hate of me
Thrust from the throne and sceptre of my sires!
To mine own country and my people’s spite
I should have paid the forfeit, by all deaths
Freely have yielded up this guilty life.
Now I live on, from men and light of day
Not yet departing; but depart I will.”

So saying, at once upon his wounded thigh
He raised him, and, albeit from the deep wound
His force flagged somewhat, with no downcast air
Called for his war-steed. This was ay his pride,
And this his solace; hereon he was wont
From all his wars to ride victorious home.
The sorrowing creature now he thus bespeaks:
“We have lived long, O *Rhaebus*, if aught long
Pertain to mortals. Or to-day shalt thou
Bear back in triumph the bloody spoils and head
Of yon *Aeneas*, and be of *Lausus’* pangs
My co-avenger, or, if all force fail
Our path to open, shalt beside me lie:
No, nor wilt thou, methinks, my bravest, deign
Brook stranger’s bidding, or a *Teucrian* lord.”

He said, and, mounted on his willing back,
As ever wont, bestrode him, and both hands
Charged with keen javelins, his head bright with brass,
Shaggy with horse-hair plume. So galloping
He dashed amidst them. In one single heart
Upsurges a vast tide of shame and grief
With fury mingled; and thrice o’er he called
With mighty voice “*Aeneas*!” Well, I trow,
*Aeneas* knew it, and prayed a jubilant prayer:
“May the great Sire of gods so bring to pass,
So lord *Apollo*! fall on, begin the fray!”
Thus much he spake, and with his threatening spear
Moved on to meet him. But the other cried:
“Reft of my son, why thinkest thou, fierce man,
To fright me now? sole way was this whereby
To work my ruin. I shudder not at death,
No, nor spare any of thy gods. Now cease;
I come to die, but bring thee first these gifts.”

He spake, and hurled a dart against the foe,
Then yet another and another plants,
In a wide circle wheeling; but the boss
Of gold bides all. Thrice round the watchful foe
Rode he in rings to leftward, from his hand
Launching the javelins; thrice the *Trojan* prince
Bears round with him upon his brazen targe
A dense spear-forest. Then wearying to prolong
Delays so many, so many darts to pluck,
And by the unequal conflict sore bestead,
Much inly pondering, forth at last he springs,
And in betwixt the war-steed’s hollow brows
Hurls his spear mightily. The beast reared up,
Lashed with his hooves the air, his rider flung,
Then, following him, head downward, pinned to earth
And with his shoulder pressed the fallen man.

*Trojan* and *Latin* shouts set heaven ablaze.
Up speeds *Aeneas*, and plucks sword from sheath,
Then o’er him: “Where is bold *Mezentius* now,
And all his heart’s wild violence?” Unto whom
The *Etruscan*, as up-glancing he drew in
A draught of heaven, and to himself returned:
“Why, bitter foe, dost taunt and threaten death?
In slaying is no sin; nor with such thought
Came I to battle, nor did my *Lausus* so
Pledge terms betwixt us. This alone I crave,
By whatso grace to fallen foes may be:
Let earth my body hide. Girt round am I
With bitter hate of my own folk, I wot.
Fend me from this their rage, and with my son
Grant fellowship in burial.” So he spake,
Welcomed the sword to his expectant throat,
And o’er his arms let pour life’s ruddy tide.

## Book XI

Meanwhile *Aurora* rising left the sea;
*Aeneas*, though stress of grief bade yield the hour
To burial of his friends, with mind by death
Bewildered, to the gods at earliest dawn
His victor-vows was paying. A mighty oak,
Lopped bare of branches, on a mound he plants,
And decks in gleaming armour torn from Prince
*Mezentius*—trophy to thy praise, great King
Of battle. The hero’s plume, still dripping blood,
And splintered spears he hangs there, the cuirass
Twice six times smitten and pierced through and through,
And on the left hand binds the brazen shield,
And hangs the ivory sword about its neck.

Then his rejoicing friends—for the whole band
Of chiefs thronged close about him—he exhorts,
Thus breaking silence: “The main work o’ the war
Has been achieved, my heroes; for the rest,
Let every fear be banished: lo! ye see
The spoils and first-fruits of the tyrant king;
And here, my handiwork, *Mezentius* stands.
Now lies our path to *Latium’s* king and town.
Arm you in spirit; in hope forestall the fray;
That when the gods give signal to pluck hence
Our standards, and lead forth the host from camp,
No pause impede you, caught at unawares,
Nor faltering purpose, born of fear, retard.

Meanwhile our comrades, that unburied lie,
Commit we to the earth—sole honour left
In depths of *Acheron*. “Aye, go forth,” he said,
“With farewell tribute grace the peerless souls
Who with their life-blood this our country won,
And to *Evander’s* sorrowing city first
Be *Pallas* sent, whom, lacking naught of man,
The dark day reft, and plunged in bitter doom.”

Weeping he spake, and to the tent retraced
His steps, where *Pallas’* lifeless corse was laid,
Watched by *Acoetes* old, who bare the arms
Once of *Evander* the *Parrhasian*, now
In less auspicious hour was faring forth,
Of his loved foster-child the appointed friend.
And all the attendant train and *Trojan* throng
Stood round, with *Ilian* women, their locks loosed
In wonted wise for sorrow; but when *Aeneas*
Within the high doors entered, they uplift
A mighty wail to heaven, and beat their breasts,
And all the royal place resounds with shriek
Of sorrow. He likewise, when the pillowed head
And face of *Pallas* snowy-white he saw,
And marked the *Ausonian* spear-head’s gaping wound
On his smooth breast, spake with o’er-welling tears:

“Poor boy, did fortune, when so blithe she came,
Envy me thee, that thou shouldst never look
Upon my realm, or home in triumph ride?
Not such my parting promise touching thee
Made to thy sire *Evander*, when he clasped
And sped me forth to win a mighty realm,
And, fearful, warned me that right brave the foe,
Stubborn the race, we strove with. And now he,
With empty hope fooled utterly, belike
Is proffering vows, and heaping high with gifts
The altars; we, the while, a lifeless corse,
That owes no more to any god in heaven,
Escort with sorrow’s ineffectual pomp.
Unhappy, thou that wilt behold thy son
Slain piteously! Is this the home-return,
The expected triumph? This my solemn pledge?
Yet here no recreant, scarred, with shameful wounds,
Shalt see, *Evander*, nor a son so saved
That thou, his sire, for dreaded death shalt pray.
Ah me! *Ausonia*, what a tower of help
Here art thou reft of, and, *Iulus*, thou!”

So, having wept his fill, he bids them lift
The hapless corse, and picks a thousand men
From his whole host, and sends them to escort
The farewell pomp, and with the father’s tears
Their own commingle—for so vast a grief
Scant solace, yet to that sad father due.
Others of arbute-boughs and oaken shoots
In haste plait hurdle-wise a pliant bier,
And the heaped bed with leafy covering shroud.

High on the rustic litter him they lay;
Even as a flower by maiden’s finger culled,
Or violet mild, or drooping hyacinth,
Ere yet the lustre or the loveliness
Hath from its form departed; mother Earth
Feeds it no longer, nor with strength supplies.
Then garments twain, with gold and purple stiff,
*Aeneas* bare forth, which, ravished with the toil,
*Sidonian Dido* erst with her own hands
Had wrought, and shot the web with subtle gold.
One of these twain—grief’s latest rite—he wraps
About the dead, and with its covering veils
The fire-doomed tresses, and heaps high withal
Full many a prize from the *Laurentian* fray,
Bidding the booty in long line be borne.
Steeds too he adds, and darts, from foemen reft:
And captives he had bound, hands lashed behind,
To send as offerings to the shade, and, slain,
Dash with their blood the fire. The chiefs themselves
He bids bear tree-trunks clad with hostile arms,
And foemen’s titles to be fixed thereon.
Hapless *Acoetes*, overworn with age,
Is onward led, now marring with clenched fists
His bosom, now with nails his face, and falls
Forward, and casts his length upon the ground.
The car too, bathed in *Rutule* blood, they lead.
Behind, the war-horse *Aethon*, trappings doffed,
Goes weeping, and the big drops wet his face.
Others bear spear and helmet; for all else
*Turnus*, as victor, holds. Then, sad array,
Follow the *Teucrians* and *Etruscans* all,
And men of *Arcady* with arms reversed.

But when the long procession of his friends
Had wholly passed, *Aeneas*, groaning deep,
Stopped, and spake further: “Unto other tears
We by the same grim destinies of war
Are summoned hence. I bid thee hail! for aye,
O mightiest *Pallas*, and for aye farewell.”
No more he spake, but to the lofty walls
Turned him, and campward bent his steps.

And now
From *Latium’s* town came envoys, olive-wreathed,
Craving his clemency: the dead, which lay
Sword-scattered o’er the plain, would he give back,
And suffer ’neath an earthen mound to pass;
With vanquished folk and bodies void of breath
There is no warring; let him spare whom once
He hailed as hosts, and fathers of his bride.

*Aeneas*, for such a prayer he might not spurn,
Grants courteously the boon, and adds these words
Moreover: “*Latins*, say what hard mishap
Hath wound you in so vast a web of war
That thus ye fly our friendship? Do ye ask
Peace for the dead, by chance of battle quelled?
Fain would I grant it to the living too.
Nor came I, had not fate assigned me here
A place wherein to settle, nor any war
Wage I against your folk: it was the king
Left our alliance, and made choice to lean
On *Turnus’* sword for succour. ’Twere more meet
Had *Turnus* faced the death ye mourn to-day.
If with armed force he thinks to fight it out,
And drive the *Teucrians* forth, beseemed him well
To meet me man to man, and spear to spear:
He should have lived whose life was granted him
Of heaven or his right hand. Now hie ye hence,
And ’neath your hapless comrades pile the fire.”

*Aeneas* had spoken. They stood wonder-hushed,
Eyes fixed and faces in one mutual stare.
Then, old in years, and still with slanderous spite
Armed against youthful *Turnus*, *Drances* thus
Makes answer: “O mighty in fame, in arms
Yet mightier, *Trojan* hero, by what praise
Can I exalt thee to the sky? Or should
Thy soul’s uprightness, or thy toils in war
Win first my wonder? We indeed thy words
Will to our native town bear blithely back,
And knit thee fast, so fortune find a way,
To *Latium’s* king. Let *Turnus* for himself
Go seek confederates. Nay, ’twill please us well
The destined ramparts of thy walls to rear,
And on our shoulders heave the stones of *Troy*.”

He had said; and all his comrades with one mouth
Murmured assent. For twice six days a truce
They plighted, and, with peace to interpose,
*Teucrians* and *Latins* o’er the wooded heights
Roamed without scathe together. The tall ash
Rings to the two-edged steel; sky-piercing pines
They topple o’er, and still with wedges cleave
Tough heart-of-oak and scented cedar-bole,
And freight with mountain-ash the groaning wains.

And now was winged Fame, the harbinger
Of woe so vast, filling *Evander’s* ears,
*Evander’s* home and city—she, who late
Of *Pallas’* triumph o’er the *Latins* told.
Out-streaming to the gates, *Arcadia’s* sons
Grasp each a funeral-torch, their ancient wont.

## The Aeneid, Book XI

Bright gleams the road with a long line of fire
That parts the fields afar. The Phrygian band,
Moving to meet them, joins the weeping train.
Soon as the matrons saw them pass the wall,
With shrieks they set the sorrowing town ablaze.

As for Evander then— no force avails
To stay him; but he thrusts amid the throng,
And, when the bier was set, on Pallas’ form
Casts him, and clings to it with groans and tears.
Scarce loosed by sorrow, words at length win way: 151
> “Not such the pledge thou gavest to thy sire,
> My Pallas, unwarily to put thy faith
> In the fell god of battles. Well I wist
> How potent was the new-born pride in arms,
> And a first onset’s all-entrancing spell. 158
> Ah! bitter first-fruit of youth’s flower! and harsh
> Prelude of neighbour war! and vows and prayers
> No god gave ear to! and thou, holiest wife,
> And happy in thy death, that spared thee not
> To see this sorrow! But, by living, I
> Have overshot my doom, to linger on
> A son-surviving sire. Troy’s friendly arms
> Would I had followed! would the Rutule darts
> Had overwhelmed me! So should I have given
> This life of mine, and I, not Pallas here,
> Been thus with funeral-pomp borne homeward! Yet
> You would I blame not, Teucrians, nor our league
> And right hands clasped in friendship: long ago
> The lot ye deal me to mine age was owed.
> But if untimely doom was o’er my son
> Impending, ’twill rejoice me that he smote
> His Volscian thousands, ere himself was slain,
> Leading the Teucrians into Latium. Nay,
> Nor other funeral could I deem thy due,
> Pallas, than good Aeneas hath devised,
> And the great Phrygians, and the Tyrrhene lords,
> And all the host Tyrrhenian. Trophies great
> They bring of whom thy right hand did to death;
> And thou too, Turnus, a huge trunk in arms
> Wert standing now, had age and strength of years
> Been matched between ye. But why, evil-starred,
> Stay I the Teucrians from the onset? Go,
> Bear heedfully this message to your king:
> That I, bereft of Pallas, still drag on
> This hated life, thy right hand is the cause,
> Which, well thou seest, to son alike and sire
> Owes Turnus. Yea, for fortune and exploit
> No room is left thee else. The joys of life
> I ask not; 'tis forbid me: but to bear
> My son these tidings in the shades below.” 181

Meanwhile the Dawn her kindly light had reared
For suffering men, renewing task and toil.
Now Prince Aeneas, now Tarchon, have set up
Their funeral-pyres along the winding shore.
Hither bore each the bodies of their kin,
With rite ancestral; from the murky flames,
Lit under, the high vault in vaporous gloom
Is muffled. Thrice about the blazing piles,
Girt in bright arms, the course they ran, thrice o’er
Compassed on steeds the mournful fires of death,
With loud lamentings. Their tears rain on earth,
And rain on armour. Up to heaven is borne
Shouting of men, and clarion-blare. Anon
Others take spoil from slaughtered Latins torn,
And heap it on the fire— helms, goodly swords,
Bridles, and glowing wheels; but others bring
Gifts to the dead familiar, their own shields
And luckless weapons. Many a steer around
To death falls stricken; and bristly swine and sheep,
From all the country ravished, they let bleed
Above the flame. Then over the wide shore
They watch their comrades burning, and keep ward
O’er the charred embers, nor can tear them thence,
Till dewy night now turns the face of heaven,
Studded with glittering stars. 202

Nor less, the while,
The hapless Latins, far remote, have reared
Innumerable pyres: of many slain
Some in the delved earth they lay, some lift
And carry to the neighbouring fields, or send
Home to the city: what remains, one vast
And indistinguishable slaughter-heap,
They burn untold, unhonoured. Then far and wide
Flare the void fields, thick-sown with rival-fires.
Thrice dawn had driven chill darkness from the sky,
When sadly from the pyres they rake and heap
The ashes up, and undistinguished bones,
And warm above them pile the mounded earth. 212
But now in homes of rich Latinus’ town
Is the chief uproar, and the mightiest share
Of long-drawn lamentation. Mothers here
With their sons’ brides forlorn, here cherished hearts
Of sorrowing sisters, boys of sires bereft,
Curse the fell war and Turnus’ bridal troth.
Him they bid arm, with his own single sword
Fight out the quarrel, who for himself demands
The realm of Italy, honours of a prince. 219
Fierce Drances fans the fire, bears testimony
Turnus alone is challenged, he alone
Called to do battle. Many a voice withal
In various counter-strain for Turnus pleads;
The queen’s great name o’ershadows him, the praise
Of many a well-earned triumph is his stay.
Amid this stir and fiery tumult, lo!
From Diomede’s great city, to crown all,
The envoys bring sad answer: all their toils
For naught were lavished; naught have gifts, or gold,
Or strenuous prayers availed them; other arms
Must Latium look to, or with terms of peace
Approach Troy’s monarch. ’Neath that load of woe
Sinks King Latinus. That Aeneas is here,
Fate-borne at heaven’s clear bidding, the god’s wrath
Warns him, and those new graves before his eyes. 255
Therefore a mighty council of his chiefs,
By royal mandate summoned, he convenes
Within his lofty portals. They have flocked
Together, and all along the crowded ways
Stream toward the palace. In the midst is set,
Eldest in years, and first in sceptred sway,
With joyless brow, Latinus. Hereupon
The envoys from the Aetolian town returned
He bids declare their tidings, point by point
Demands full answer. Then on every tongue
Fell silence, and obedient to his word
Thus Venulus begins: 262
> “O citizens,
> We have seen Diomede and the Argive camp,
> And overpassed all perils of the way,
> And touched the hand whereby fell Ilium’s realm.
> He was founding walled Argyripa, named
> From his own nation, in the new-won fields
> Of Iapygian Garganus. So,
> When we had entered, and gat leave to speak,
> Our gifts we proffer, name and race declare,
> Who our invaders, for what cause we come
> To Arpi. Having heard us, he replied
> Thus with unruffled brow: ‘O happy race
> Of Saturn’s realm, Ausonian folk of old,
> What chance disturbs your quiet, and lures you on
> To challenge wars ye know not? We, whoe’er
> Outraged the fields of Ilium with the sword—
> I waive all sufferings ’neath her lofty walls
> In battle drained, the warriors that lie whelmed
> In yonder Simois— have, the wide world through,
> Paid, one and all, the forfeit of our crime
> In untold pangs, a remnant Priam’s self
> Might pity. Let Minerva’s gloomy star
> Bear witness, and the Euboean crags, and thou,
> Caphereus the avenger. From that field
> Wide-scattered, Menelaus, Atreus’ son,
> Far as to Proteus’ pillars exiled dwells;
> Ulysses hath the Aetnean Cyclops seen. 265
> Why of the realm of Neoptolemus
> Tell, or Idomeneus’ uprooted home,
> Or Locrians dwelling on the Libyan shore?
> Even he, the great Achaeans’ chief himself,
> Lord of Mycenae, on the threshold’s edge
> Fell by the hand of his accursed wife;
> For conquered Asia crouched a paramour.
> To think that heaven hath grudged me to return
> Home to my country’s altars, and behold
> The wife I long for, and fair Calydon!
> Nay, sight-appalling signs pursue me still,
> And my old comrades, lost to me, as birds
> Now wing the vault, or roam the rivers— ah!
> That such dire torment on my folk should fall!—
> And fill the rocks with lamentable cries. 277
> Naught else had I to look for from that hour
> When with infatuate weapon I assailed
> Celestial frames, and outraged with a wound
> The hand of Venus. Nay, constrain me not
> To such encounters. With the sons of Troy,
> Since Pergama fell down, no war I wage,
> Nor with delight mind me of ancient ills. 280
> The gifts ye bring me from your native shores
> Bear rather to Aeneas. We have faced
> The rude edge of his weapons, hand to hand
> Have grappled with him: trust me, who have tried,
> How huge he rises to the shield, how swings
> The whirlwind of his spear. Had Ida’s land
> Borne twain beside, such heroes, Troy herself
> Had stormed the gates of Inachus, and Greece,
> With doom reversed, were wailing. All the time
> We lingered ’neath the walls of stubborn Troy,
> ’Twas Hector and Aeneas by whose might
> Checked was Greek victory, and for ten years’ space
> Fell backward. Both renowned for valour, both
> Matchless for martial exploit, this man bore
> The palm for goodness. Hand to hand with him
> Unite in friendship, by what means ye may,
> But see your weapons shun the shock of his.’ 293
> Thou hast heard the monarch’s answer, gracious sire,
> And what he counsels for this mighty war.”

Scarce ceased the envoys, ere tumultuously
From mouth to mouth of the Ausonians ran
A various hubbub; as, when rocks impede
Some rushing river, from the imprisoned flood
A dull roar rises, and the neighbour-banks
Chafe loud with plashing waters. Soon as hearts
Beat calm again, and busy tongues were still,
First calling upon heaven, from his high throne
The King broke silence: “Well could I have wished,
Latins, and better had it been, ere now
To have determined of our kingdom’s weal,
Nor at such hour to bid you to debate.
While foemen sit before the walls. A war
Disastrous wage we, O my countrymen,
With the gods’ offspring and a hero-race
Invincible, who tire not of the fight,
No, nor when vanquished can let go the sword. 307
Hope in Aetolia’s confederate arms,
If aught ye had, resign it. His own hope
Is every man: but this how frail ye see;
All else, in what wide ruin overthrown,
Needs but the witness of your eyes and hands.
Nor blame I any; what utmost valour could,
We have compassed, with the realm’s whole strength have striven.
Now mark; the upshot of my wavering thoughts
I will unfold, and— give me your good heed—
Teach briefly. Bordering on the Tuscan stream
An ancient tract have I, stretched westward far
Past the Sicanian borders: tilled it is
By Rutules and Auruncans, who with plough
Task the stiff hills, and on the roughest slopes
Graze cattle. Let all this region, with its belt
Of lofty pine-clad highland, be made o’er
To Teucrian friendship; and just terms of peace
Name we, and summon them to share our realm. 322
Here let them settle, if this be their desire,
And build them ramparts. But, if other bounds,
Another folk than ours, they list to win,
Are free to quit our borders,— twice ten ships
Of oak Italian frame we, ay, or more,
If they can man them; by the water’s edge
Lies wood enow; their number and their size
Themselves shall teach us; be it ours to give
Brass, hands, and shipment-tackle. Furthermore,
For word hereof, and warrant of our league,
I will, a hundred Latins, noblest-born,
Make embassage, and proffer boughs of peace,
And bear them presents— talent-weights of gold,
And ivory, and a chair and robe of state,
Our royal emblems. Freely before all
Give counsel, and uphold the weary state.” 335

Then Drances, foe inveterate, whom the fame
Of Turnus aye with sidelong envy stirred
And stung to bitterness, lavish of wealth,
Tongue-valiant, but a frosty hand for war,
At council-board no vain adviser held,
In faction strong,— his mother’s proud descent
Ennobling whom an obscure sire begat—
Drances at length uprising, with these words,
Heightens and heaps their wrath: 337
> “Obscure to none
> Nor needing voice of ours, O gracious sire,
> The theme that thou debatest. One and all
> Whereto the State’s weal tendeth, they own they know,
> Yet dare but mutter. Let him now concede
> Untrammelled speech, and his blown pride abate,
> Through whose disastrous leading, froward mien—
> Ay, I will speak it, though with arms and death
> He menace me— so many stars of war
> Have we seen set, and the whole city plunged
> In mourning, while the Trojan camp he braves,
> Counting on flight, and scares the heaven with arms. 351
> Yet one to all those gifts thou badest send
> Or promise to the Dardans— add but one,
> Thrice gracious king, and let no blusterer’s wrath
> O’ersway thee not to give thy daughter, sire,
> In meet espousal to a peerless son,
> And on this treaty set a lasting seal.
> But if such terror hold us, heart and mind,
> Himself conjure we, sue his grace to yield,
> And their inalienable right resign
> To ruler and to realm. Why hurl so oft
> These hapless folk into the jaws of peril,
> O fount and well-spring of our Latium’s ills? 361
> No safety is in war: ’tis peace we all
> Crave of thee, Turnus, and, with peace, her one
> Inviolable pledge. I first, whom thou
> Feign’st for thy foe, nor reck I so to be,
> Sue suppliant-wise. Have pity of thine own;
> Abate thy pride, and, vanquished, quit the field.
> Enough of routs and slaughters have we seen,
> Vast tracts have left to desolation. Else,
> If glory stir thee, if such hardihood
> Thou nurse within thy breast, so hug to heart
> A palace for thy bridal dower, be bold,
> And launch thee fearless on the opposing foe. 370
> Must we, that Turnus to his arms may take
> A royal bride, as paltry lives forsooth,
> A herd unwept, unburied, strew the plain?
> Thou too, if there be in thee aught of force,
> Aught of the war-god of thy sires, confront
> And face thy challenger.”

As thus he spake
Out blazed the fury of Turnus; loud he groaned,
And from his bosom’s depth these words broke way: 377
> “Lavish, I wot, is aye thy wealth of tongue,
> Drances, when war demandeth hands, and when
> The sires are summoned, there the first art thou.
> Nathless naught need we fill our court with words,
> Which, big albeit, fly from thee safe enow,
> While the wall-rampart keeps the foe at bay,
> Nor blood yet drowns the trenches. Ay, let peal
> The wordy thunder; ’tis thy wont of old;
> And charge me, Drances, thou, with cowardice,
> Seeing thy hand hath reared such slaughter-heaps
> Of Teucrians, and set all the fields ablaze
> With trophies. What the pulse of valour can,
> Yet may’st thou prove: nor far methinks to seek,
> But round our very ramparts swarm the foe.
> We march to meet them: wherefore hold’st aback?
> Or will the war-god ever make his home
> But in that windy tongue, those flying feet? 391
> What, vanquished? I? Will any, thou foul liar,
> Flout me as vanquished justly, who beholds
> Tiber still swelling o’er with Ilian blood,
> Evander’s whole house by the roots laid low,
> And his Arcadians stripped of arms? Not such
> Did Bitias prove me, and huge Pandarus,
> Nor whom, a thousand in a single day,
> My victor-arm to nether Tartarus hurled,
> Penned and shut fast within the foeman’s wall. 398
> ‘No safety in war?’ Such brainless bodings keep
> For thine own fortune, and the Dardan’s head.
> Ay, cease not with gross panic to whelm all
> In wide confusion, laud to heaven the might
> Of a twice-conquered nation, and decry
> Latinus’ arms beside it. Now, forsooth,
> The Myrmidonian lords and Tydeus’ son
> Tremble before the Phrygian host, now, too,
> Achilles of Larissa; and Aufidus
> From Hadria’s waves flees backward. Or, again,
> When feigns the schemer’s villainy to cower
> Before my chiding, and with terror whets
> The sting of calumny! Nay, such a life—
> Cease to be troubled— by this hand of mine
> Ne’er shalt thou forfeit; let it with thee dwell,
> Of that thy breast fit denizen. Now, sire,
> To thee and thy great counsels I return. 410
> If in our arms thou rest no further hope,
> If we so friendless are, and, routed once,
> Are utterly o’erthrown, and fortune foiled
> Hath no retrieval, pray we then for peace,
> And reach out helpless hands. But ah! if aught
> Were ours of wonted valour, him would I
> Deem before all men of his travail blest,
> Peerless of soul, who, such a sight to shun,
> Fell once for all, and bit the dust, in death.
> But if means yet be ours, a host for war
> Undiminished, and Italia’s towns and tribes
> Remain to aid us; if with outpoured blood
> Troy bought her triumph— for their own dead have they,
> And the like tempest swept o’er all— why thus
> Inglorious faint we on the threshold’s edge?
> Why quake our limbs before the trumpet-call? 424
> Time, and the shifting toil of changeful days,
> Hath many a lot repaired; and many a man
> Wave after wave of fortune hath by turns
> Played with, and planted on firm ground again.
> The Aetolian— Arpi— will not succour us:
> Yet will Messapus, and Tolumnius blest,
> And all those chiefs by many a nation sent;
> Nor will scant fame attend the chosen flower
> Of Latium and Laurentum’s land. Ours, too,
> Camilla, from the Volscians’ peerless stem,
> Heading her horse-troop, squadrons bright with brass. 433
> But if the Teucrian lords bid me alone
> Do battle, and ye would have it so, and I
> Stand here the hinderer of your common good,

> I should draw back from any bold essay.
> Dauntless will I confront him, though he match
> Even great Achilles, and don arms like his,
> Wrought by the hand of Vulcan. Lo! to you
> And my bride’s sire, Latinus, I devote
> My life— I, Turnus, of the brave of old

> Aeneas summons? Let him, I implore,
> Nor Drances rather, if heaven’s wrath be here,
> With his life pay the forfeit, nor, if here
> Prowess and honour, bear the palm away!” 444

So of dark issues held they hot debate:
Aeneas meanwhile moved on from camp to field.
Lo! one with tidings, amid uproar wild,
Speeds through the palace, and with mighty dread
Fills all the city, that for battle dight
Teucrian and Tyrrhene host are marching down
From Tiber’s river o’er all the plain. At once
Confusion and heart-shaking seize the crowd,
And wrath, roused in them with no gentle stings.
With quivering hands they clutch at arms; for arms
Clamour their youth; the sires to weeping fall
And mournful mutterings. Now from every side
Rises to heaven a loud discordant din;
Even as in some tall grove when flocks of birds
Have settled, or on Padusa’s fishy stream
Swans hoarsely cry athwart the clamorous pools. 458
“Ay, crowd to council, citizens,” Turnus cries,
Seizing the moment, “and sit praising peace,
While they rush armed on empire.” No word more
He uttered, but, up-starting, swiftly flung
From out the lofty hall. “Thou, Volusus,
Bid arm the Volscian cohorts,” he exclaimed,
“And lead the Rutules on. Messapus, thou,
And Coras with thy brother, array the horse,
And o’er the wide plain spread them. Some secure
Each access to the town, and man the towers;
The rest, where I shall bid, fall on with me.” 467

At once a wild rush to the wall begins
From every quarter. Sire Latinus too
Quits council, and breaks off his high designs,
By the dark hour dismayed; and oft his heart
Upbraids him that he freely welcomed not
Dardan Aeneas to the adopted rank
Of citizen and son. Before the gates
Others dig trenches, or heave stakes and stones
On shoulder. The hoarse clarion for the fray
Gives bloody signal. Then in motley ring
Boys, see, and matrons gird the ramparts, all
To one last effort summoned. Furthermore,
Up to the temple that crowns Pallas’ height,
Thronged with a company of dames, the queen
Rides onward, bringing gifts, and at her side
The maid Lavinia, source of all that woe,
Her comely eyes cast earthward. Entering in,
The matrons fill the holy place with smoke
Of incense, and send forth a mournful cry
From the high portal: “O mighty in arms,
And mistress of the sword, Tritonian maid,
Break with thy might the Phrygian robber’s spear,
Himself cast prone on earth, and spurn him low
Beneath our lofty gates.” Turnus the while
With emulous fury arms him for the fray. 486

Even now, the ruddy breastplate donned, he stood
Bristling with brazen scales; his legs he had sheathed
In golden cuisses, and, bare-browed as yet,
His battle-blade on thigh, all golden shone.
As down he hies him from the fortress-height
Exulting, and in hope forestalls the foe:
As with snapped tether free at length, a horse
Breaks stall, and, launched upon the open plain,
Or seeks the herds and pastures of the mares,
Or, wont to plunge him in the well-known stream,
Darts forth, and, rearing his proud crest on high,
Neighs for mere wantonness; the tossing mane
Plays over neck and shoulder. Him to meet,
Backed by her Volscian host, Camilla sped,
And hard beside the gateway leapt from horse,
Queen as she was, whom following, all the band
Glide from their steeds to earth. Then thus she spake: 507
> “Turnus, if aught self-trust beseem the brave,
> I dare and pledge me here Troy’s troop to face,
> And sole against the Tyrrhene horsemen ride.
> Let me first prove the perils of the fray:
> Tarry thou here on foot beside the wall,
> And guard the ramparts.” Whereunto replied
> Turnus, his eyes on the dread maiden fixed,
> “O maiden, glory of Italy, what thanks
> Can I or hope to utter or repay?
> But since thy spirit doth all price out-soar,
> Share now the task with me. Aeneas, ’tis said—
> And scouts sent forth confirm the tale— hath pushed
> Forward, relentless still, his light-armed horse,
> To scour the plain; himself, mounting the ridge,
> Draws cityward by the lone mountain-heights. 514
> In the wood’s hollow track a sleight of war
> I purpose— to beset with armed men
> The thoroughfare of the mountain gorge. Do thou
> Meet and do battle with the Etruscan horse;
> Valiant Messapus at thy side will be,
> With Latium’s squadron and Tiburtus’ band;
> Take thou too on thyself a leader’s sway.”
So saying, Messapus and the federate chiefs
Cheered with like words to battle, he moves to meet
The foe. There is a vale that curves and bends,
Well framed for stratagems and wiles of war,
Hemmed in on either side by wooded walls
Impenetrably dark. Hereinto leads
A narrow footpath, and a strait ravine
Churlish of access. Over it there lies
High on the watch-towers of the mountain-top
A broad expanse unlooked for, safe retreat
To charge from right and left-ward, or take stand
Upon the ridge, and roll down mighty rocks. 529
Hither the warrior, thridding well-known ways,
Hies him, has seized the spot, and sat him down
Within the treacherous forest.

But meanwhile
Latona’s daughter in the halls of heaven
Addressed fleet Opis, of the sacred band
Of maids that be her fellows, and poured forth
These sorrowing words: “Lo! to the cruel war
Goes forth Camilla, maiden, and in vain
Girds on these arms of ours, though dear to me
Beyond all others. Nor soothly is that love,
Thou knowest, new-born to Dian, nor her heart
Touched with a sudden charm. When Metabus,
Now driven through hate of his tyrannic sway
Forth from his realm, Privernum’s ancient hold
Was leaving, through the battle’s press he bore
His babe in flight, to share his banishment,
And named her from her mother, in altered wise,
Camilla for Casmilla. To the long
Lone forest-heights he sped, still carrying her
Before him on his bosom. From all sides
Fierce darts beset him, and in circling swarms
Hovered the Volscian soldiery, when lo!
Athwart his flight full Amasenus’ flood
Foamed with o’er-brimming banks; so wild a storm
Had burst the clouds of heaven. Here, fain to swim,
Love for the babe withholds him, and he quakes
For his dear burden. Pondering every way,
Hardly at last this swift resolve took root: 557
A huge spear, which the warrior’s stalwart hand
Bore, of hard-knotted and fire-seasoned oak—
To this he lashed his daughter, swathed in bark
Of the wild cork, and midmost of the shaft
Bound her for throwing, and then, with mighty hand
Poising it, cried to heaven: ‘O gracious Maid,
Child of Latona, hauntress of the grove,
I vow this babe thy servant, I her sire;
Thy weapon first she grasps, and from her foe
Flies through the air, thy suppliant. For thine own,
Goddess, receive her, I implore, who now
Is to the random breezes given.’ He spake,
Drew back his arm, and strongly wheeled the spear,
And threw it: the waves roared; over the swift stream
Flies poor Camilla on the hurtling dart. 565
But Metabus, by a mighty band the while
Pressed closelier, plunges, and in triumph plucks
His gift to Trivia from the grassy bank,
Javelin and maid together. Him thenceforth
Nor homes of men, nor city-walls received;
Nor had his wild heart brooked it, but he led
A life of shepherds on the lonely hills.
Here in the brakes, amid rough forest-dens,
Reared he his daughter upon wild mare’s milk,
Squeezing the teats into her tender lips. 572
Soon as the baby-feet their earliest steps
Had planted, with sharp javelin’s weight he armed
Her hands, and from the tiny shoulder hung
Shafts and a bow. For gold to deck her hair,
And for long-trailing robe, a tiger’s spoils
Hung from her head adown the back. Even then
With tender hand she launched her puny darts,
And, whirling round her head the smooth-thonged sling,
Struck crane Strymonian, or white swan, to earth.
Her many a mother through the Tyrrhene towns
Sought for their sons, but vainly. Well content
To mate alone with Dian, she cherishes
A lifelong passion for the hunter’s darts
And maidenhood unsullied. Would she had ne’er,
Caught up by such a wave of war, essayed
To brave in fight the Teucrians! so were she
Still dear, and of my maiden band to-day. 586
But come, since harsh fate dogs her hard at heel,
Glide, nymph, from heaven, and Latium’s borders seek,
Where now begins the dark ill-omened fray,
Take these, and pluck from quiver a vengeful shaft.
Herewith, whoe’er with wound her sacred flesh—
Or Trojan or Italian— shall profane,
Let him like quittance pay me blood for blood.
Thereafter I in hollow cloud will bear
Her hapless corse for burial, and, of arms
All undespoiled, to her own land restore.”
She spake, but the other down the light air sped
Hurtling, her form in a black whirlwind swathed. 596

Meanwhile the Trojan host draw nigh the walls,
The Etruscan chiefs and all their horse-array,
Told into ordered troops. The war-steed neighs,
Paws the wide plain and with the tight-drawn curb
Fights, as he faces to this side and that:
Then bristles the wide plain with iron spears,
And the field blazes with their brandished blades.
Nor less Messapus, Latium’s swift-foot sons,
And Coras with his brother, and the light troop
Of maid Camilla, show forth upon the plain,
Confronting them; with back-drawn hands afar
They couch the spear, or shake the quivering lance; 606
And fiery-fierce now grows the tramp of men,
Neighing of steeds. By this had either host
Paused within spear-cast: then, with sudden shout,
Forward they burst, cheer on their maddened steeds,
And all together, from all sides, pour forth
Darts thick as snowflakes, that obscure the sky.
At once Tyrrhenus and Aconteus keen
Rush each on each with spears that meet amain,

# The Aeneid XI

And first deal thunderous downfall, either steed
Shock-shattered with the brunt of breast to breast.
*Aconteus*, like a levin-bolt flung forth,
Or ponderous engine-stone, is hurled afar
Headlong, and scatters to the winds his life.
Straight all is disarray; the *Latins* turn,
Set shield to back, and for the ramparts ride.
*Troy* gives them chase; *Asilas* leads the van.
And now the gates they near, when once again
The *Latins* lift the war-shout, and wheel round
Their chargers' supple necks. The victors fly,
And with loose bridle gallop fast and far.
As when, with alternating ebb and flow,
The advancing sea now rushes to the beach,
Shoots o’er the crags in torrent foam, and bathes
With curved billow all the sandy bourne,
Now, with swift ebb, retreats, and sucking back
The shingle, leaves the beach with gliding shoal.
Twice o’er the *Tuscans* to their ramparts drive
The *Rutules* headlong, and twice o’er look back
Routed, and sling behind their covering shields.
But when, for the third onset charging home,
Army gripped army, and man singled man,
Then were there dying groans, and deep in blood
Roll arms and bodies and death-wounded steeds,
Mingled with slaughtered men; the fight swells fierce.
*Orsilochus* at the steed of *Remulus*—
Himself he feared to face—a javelin hurled,
And left the steel beneath its ear, whereat
The stricken brute rears furiously, and flings
In air his fore-legs, with uplifted breast,
Sustaining not the wound. Tumbled to earth,
His rider rolled. *Catillus* hurls from horse
*Iollas*, and, of giant heart to match
His giant arms and frame, *Herminius*:
Bare-headed he with tawny locks, bare too
His shoulders; nor wounds daunt him, such a front
He offers to all weapons. The spear sped,
And, quivering through the mighty shoulder-joints,
Pinned, and bowed double all his bulk with pain.
Dark blood flows wide, as with the sword they slay,
Fighting, or seek through wounds a glorious death.
But midst the slaughter, like an *Amazon*,
One breast for battle bared, and quiver-girt,
Rages *Camilla*, and now thick and fast
Showers from her hand tough javelins, and now grips
The doughty war-axe with unwearying grasp.
While from her shoulder clangs the golden bow,
The arms of *Dian*. Nay, if forced to fly,
And backward beaten, with bow turned she aims
Retreating arrows. Round about her throng
The comrades of her choice, *Larina*, maid,
And *Tulla*, and *Tarpeia* brandishing
An axe of bronze, *Italia’s* daughters; whom
Godlike *Camilla* for her own glory chose,
And as good helpers both in peace and war:
Like *Thracian Amazons*, when *Thermodon’s* flood
Shakes to their tramp, as in gay arms they ride
To battle, or round *Hippolyte*, or when
*Penthesilea*, child of *Mars*, from war
Comes charioted, and all the woman-host
With loud tumultuous shouting madly prance,
Armed with their moony shields. Whom first, whom last,
Fierce maiden, didst thou dash to earth? What tale
Of warrior-forms stretch dying in the dust?
*Euneus* first, from *Clytius* sprung, whose breast,
Confronting and left bare, she pierces through
With her long pine-shaft. Vomiting forth streams
Of blood, he falls, and bites the gory dust,
And, dying, writhes upon his wound; anon
*Liris*, and o’er him *Pegasus*, of whom
One thrown in act to gather up the reins,
His steed stabbed under him, one hurrying up
With unarmed hand to aid him as he falls,
Meet headlong death together. Then to these
She adds *Amastrus*, son of *Hippotas*,
And, leaning forward, plies with spear from far
*Tereus*, *Harpalycus*, *Demophoon*,
And *Chromis*; yea, for every shaft that sped,
Hurled from the maiden’s hand, some *Phrygian* fell.
In uncouth arms on *Iapygian* steed,
Afar rides hunter *Ornytus*; a hide
Stripped from a bullock swathes his shoulders broad,
Turned warrior now; a wolf’s huge-gaping mouth
For head-gear—jaws and flashing teeth; his hands
Armed with rude hunting-blade: so through the ranks
He moves, and by a whole head tops them all.
Him now she caught—amid the battle’s rout
Light task enow—and speared, and over him
Cried in fierce scorn: “O *Tuscan*, didst thou deem
’Twas forest-game thou huntedst? Lo! the day
Is come that shall your people’s vaunts refute
With woman’s darts. Yet to thy father’s shades
No mean renown goes with thee, to have fallen
Slain by *Camilla’s* spear.” *Orsilochus*
And *Butes* next, in bulk *Troy’s* mightiest twain:
But *Butes* from behind she stabbed, where gleamed
The neck 'twixt helm and hauberk, as he rode,
And the light shield from his left shoulder hung:
*Orsilochus* she flies, and, heading off
In a wide sweep, wheels inward, and so foils,
Pursuing the pursuer. Then at length,
Up-towering higher, through basnet and through bone
With strokes redoubled the strong axe she drives
For all his supplicating cries: the wound
Spatters his face with the hot brain. Here happed
Upon her path, and at the sudden sight
Hung terrified aback, the warrior-son
Of *Aunus*, dweller upon *Apennine*,
Not meanest of *Ligurians*, while the Fates
Allowed his lies. He, seeing he could not shun
The fray by flight, nor turn aside the queen
Now hard at heel, with subtle craft and wile
Essaying to ply trickery, thus begins:
“What glory is it, woman as thou art,
To trust in a steed’s strength? Give o’er escape,
Dare close with me on equal ground, and come
Gird thee to fight on foot; full soon shalt know
To whom vain boasting bringeth bane.” He spake;
She, stung to fury, and with the bitter smart
Burning, her charger to a comrade gave,
And in like arms stood fronting him on foot,
With bare blade dauntless, and unblazoned shield.
But, deeming guile had won, away darts he,
Turns bridle in hot haste, rides off, and goads
His galloper to full speed with armed heel.
“Thou, false *Ligurian*, puffed with empty pride,
Thy slippery native tricks hast played in vain;
Ay, nor shall treachery win thee scathless way
To juggler *Aunus*.” Thus the maiden cries,
And swift as fire, with lightning steps, afoot
Passes the steed, confronts him, grasps the rein,
Grapples, and wreaks red vengeance on the foe:
Lightly as when a hawk, that bodeful bird,
Winging from some tall crag, o’ertakes a dove
High in the cloud, and, clutched within his gripe,
Mangles her body with hooked feet, the while
Blood and rent feathers flutter from the sky.
But with no eyeless watch the Sire of men
And gods hereon from high *Olympus’* top
Sat gazing. To the ruthless fight he goads
*Tyrrhenian Tarchon*, with no gentle stings
Pricks him to fury. So, ’mid weltering heaps,
Ranks wavering, rides he, with this cry or that
Kindles the troops, and, calling each by name,
Rallies the runaways to fight. “What fear,
O never to be shamed, O laggards still!
What coward sloth hath seized your *Tuscan* hearts?
Routs and makes rabble of such ranks as these
A woman? Say why then wield we sword, or grasp
These idle darts? To love naught slack are ye
And nightly bouts, or, when the wry-necked fife
Of *Bacchus* hath the dance proclaimed, to look
For revel and wine-cup on the loaded board—
Your joy, your passion this—till favouring seer
Announce the sacred feast, and victim fat
To the tall groves invite you.” Thus he spake,
And, courting his own death, amid the press
Spurs, and at *Venulus* like a whirlwind drives,
Hales him from horse, and in a foeman’s grip
Clasped to his breast bears off at furious speed.
A shout goes up to heaven; all *Latin* eyes
Upon them turn. Like fire along the plain,
Bearing both man and armour, *Tarchon* flies;
Then from the foe’s spear snapping off the head,
Gropes for a vulnerable point, to deal
A death-blow. The other from his throat the while,
Struggling, wards off the wound, force baffling force:
As when a golden eagle, soaring high,
Swoops and bears off a serpent in his clutch,
Foot-fastened in its folds, with claws that cling;
But the maimed snake writhes tortuous, coil on coil,
Pricks scales erect, and hisses with its mouth,
High-towering; none the less with hooked beak
He plies his struggling victim, all the while
Scourging the air with pinion-strokes: e’en so
*Tarchon* from *Tibur’s* battle-ranks bears off
His prize in triumph. *Maeonia’s* sons rush on
Following their chief’s example and success.
Then *Arruns*, ripe for doom, wheels, dart in hand,
Round swift *Camilla*, and, with many a wile
Preventing, tries what chance may best bestead.
Where’er the maid spurs furious ’mid the ranks,
There up comes *Arruns*, silent scours her track—
Where’er triumphant from the foe retires,
Thither turns he his swift and furtive rein.
Now this approach, now that, he traverses,
Circling on all sides, and relentless shakes
His deadly javelin. *Chloreus*, as it chanced,
Sacred to *Cybele*, and erewhile her priest,
In *Phrygian* arms shone glorious from afar,
Urging his foamy steed, its saddle-cloth
A fell with brass scales feathered, clasped with gold.
In foreign purple darkly dight he rode,
Launching *Gortynian* shafts from *Lycian* bow;
Gold hung the bow from shoulder, gold the casque
On the diviner’s head; a saffron scarf
Rustling with gauzy waves he had bound up
Into a knot with tawny gold, and wore
Needle-wrought tunic and barbaric hose.
Him now the maid, or fain to fix on shrine
*Trojan* arms, or to flaunt in captive gold,
From all the melee singling, huntress-like,
Chased blindly, and through the ranks all reckless burned
With woman’s love of booty and of spoil;
When *Arruns* from his ambush seized at last
The moment, and let speed his javelin, thus
Imploring heaven: “*Apollo*, chief of gods,
And guardian of *Soracte’s* sacred height,
Whom we of all men honour, for whom is fed
The glow of heaped pine, while ’midst the fire
Thy votaries we, by holy zeal up-borne,
In the live embers deep our footprints press,
Grant, Sire, that this foul shame, for thou canst all,
Be by my darts abolished. I desire
Nor arms, nor trophies of the maid’s defeat,
Nor any spoil; what else my hand has wrought
Shall win me glory: let but this dread pest
Fall ’neath my weapon, I will get me back
Inglorious to the cities of my sires.”
*Apollo* heard, and inwardly vouchsafed
Half the fulfilment of his prayer, but half
To the fleet winds he scattered. To lay low
*Camilla* with swift stroke of death—thus far
Yields he his asking; that his stately home
Should see him back return, he granted not;
The wild winds changed his utterance into air.
So, when the spear sped hurtling, launched through heaven,
Their eager thoughts and eyes the *Volscians* all
Turned toward the queen. She only nor of breeze
Nor hurtling sound nor sky-borne weapon weened;
Till, buried in her protruding breast, the spear
Clave, deeply driven, and drank her maiden blood.
Her scared troop hurry round her, and sustain
Their sinking mistress. Fearful beyond all
Flies *Arruns*, terror mingling with his joy;
Nor longer dares he on his lance rely,
Nor face the maidens’ weapons. And as the wolf,
Ere hostile darts can follow, plunges straight
By pathless ways into the mountain heights,
If shepherd he hath slain, or mighty bull,
And, ’ware of his bold deed, with slackened tail
Clapped quivering ’neath his belly, seeks the woods;
So *Arruns* whirled from men’s eyes madly, plunged,
Content with flight, amid the warrior throng.
She plucks the dart with dying hand; but deep
Betwixt the rib-bones sticks the embedded steel.
Bloodless she droops; droop too her death-chilled eyes;
The once bright colour from her face has ebbed.
Then thus with failing breath to *Acca*, one
Of her companions, spake she, who alone
Of all *Camilla’s* maiden-band had been
Friend of her bosom, and partner of her cares:
“*Acca*, my sister,” in such wise she spake,
“I can no more; even now the bitter wound
Quells me, and all around grows dim and dark.
Fly, bear to *Turnus* this my latest word:
Bid him bear up the battle, and ward off
The *Trojans* from the wall. And now—farewell.”
So saying, she dropped the reins, all helplessly
Gliding to earth. Then, cold and colder grown,
Slowly she slipped the body’s bonds, let fall
The neck now nerveless, and death-ravished head,
Dropping her war-gear; and the spirit passed
Moaning indignant to the shades below.
Then boundless uproar surging heavenward strikes
The golden stars; around *Camilla* fallen
The fight grows bloodier; in one dense array
On rush the *Teucrian* host, the *Tyrrhene* chiefs,
And, flanking all, *Evander’s Arcad* horse.
But *Opis*, *Trivia’s* sentinel, long since,
Throned on the mountain-height, sits undismayed
Watching the conflict. When amid the din
Of raging warriors far away she spied
*Camilla* by death’s bitter doom fordone,
She groaned, and thus with heart-drawn utterance spake:
“Dearly, too dearly, maid, hast thou atoned
Thine armed defiance of the sons of *Troy*,
Nor aught availed thee in green solitudes
To have served *Dian*, or on shoulder borne
The quiver of our craft. Yet hath thy queen
Not left thee, even in death’s extremity,
Bare of all honour, nor shall this thine end
Be noised not through the world, nor thou endure
An unavenged name. For whosoever
With desecrating wound hath pierced thy flesh,
The well-earned forfeit with his life shall pay.”
’Neath a tall mountain stood the giant tomb
Of King *Dercennus*, the *Laurentine* old,
Of mounded earth, and roofed with ilex dark:
Here first the lovely goddess with swift spring
Plants her, and from the lofty rising-ground
Spies *Arruns*. When in flashing armour bright
She marked him vainly swelling, “Why,” she cries,
“Swerv’st thou aside? Turn hither, and draw nigh
To meet thy doom, and for *Camilla* take
Due guerdon. Must such as thou by *Dian’s* darts
Perish?” She spake, and, like a *Thracian* maid,
Forth from gilt quiver plucked a winged shaft,
Stretched it on bow to strike him, and drew far,
Until, the bent tips meeting, and both hands
Now level, with her left the point she touched,
Her bosom with the bow-string in her right.
Forthwith the shaft’s hiss and the hurtling air
Heard *Arruns*, and the selfsame moment felt
The barb within his body. Him, gasping out
Life’s latest groan, his comrades leave to lie
Forgotten in the plain’s unnoted dust;
*Opis* to high *Olympus* wings her way.
First flies, of queen bereft, *Camilla’s* troop
Of light-armed horse; the *Rutules* break and fly;
Flies keen *Atinas*; captains scattered far
And cohorts leaderless for shelter make,
And, backward turning, for the ramparts ride.
Nor any can with darts sustain the rush
Of the death-dealing *Teucrians*, or make stand
Against them; but their unstrung bows they cast
On fainting shoulders, and the four-foot tramp
Of galloping horse-hooves shakes the crumbling plain.
Rolls toward the ramparts a black storm of dust,
And on the watch-towers mothers beat their breasts,
And raise a woman’s wail aloft to heaven.
Who through the open gates dash first, on these
The foe press madly, mingling with the rout;
Nor ’scape they piteous slaughter, but thrust through
Even on the threshold, with their native walls
And sheltering homes around, gasp out their lives.
Some close the gates, and dare not to their friends
Open, or let them pass, for all their prayers,
Within the ramparts; and anon begins
Most piteous carnage, as these guard with swords
The portal, those upon the sword-points rush.
Shut out before their weeping parents’ eyes,
Into the trenches some are headlong hurled
By the wild rout; some, spurring at full speed,
With battering force tilt blindly at the gates
And their stout barriers. At the conflict’s height
The very mothers from the walls—true love
Of country points them—when their eyes beheld
*Camilla*, shower down darts with trembling hand;
With stout oak-truncheons and fire-hardened stakes
Hotly they strive to ape the strength of steel,
And foremost for their ramparts burn to die.
Meanwhile amid the wood fills *Turnus’* ear
The terrible tale, and fraught with dire amaze
Comes *Acca’s* word; the *Volscian* ranks are quelled,
*Camilla* fallen; the foe rush fiercely on,
And with triumphant arms have swept the field;
Now to the ramparts spreads the panic. He,
Raging—so rules it *Jove’s* relentless will—
Quits his hill-ambush, the rough wood forsakes.
Scarce had he passed from sight, and gained the plain,
Ere Prince *Aeneas* enters the void glen,
And tops the ridge, and quits the forest-gloom.
So swiftly both with all their war-array
March town-ward, nor far parted each from each;
And lo! *Aeneas* at once beheld the plain
Smoking with dust afar, and therewithal
*Laurentum’s* host; and *Turnus* was aware
Of fell *Aeneas* armed for fight, and heard
The approach of tramping feet and neighing steeds.
And straight in shock of battle would they clash,
But ruddy *Phoebus* in the *Iberian* flood
Now dips his tired team, and with ebbing day
Bids night return. Before the city-walls
They bivouac, and entrench the ramparts round.

## Book XII

When *Turnus* saw the *Latins* had waxed faint,
Crushed by the war’s reverse, his promise now
Claimed for fulfilment, all eyes turned on him.
With wrath implacable he burns, and rears
Aloft his courage. As lo! on *Punic* plains
A lion, his breast by hunters wounded sore,
At last to battle stirs him, with fierce joy
Shakes from his neck the shaggy mane, and snaps
The robber’s rooted weapon, undismayed,
Roaring with blood-stained mouth; not otherwise,
Once fired, the rage of *Turnus* swells apace:
Then thus the king accosts he, and begins
With blustering speech: “In *Turnus* is no stop;
Yon dastards of *Aeneas* have no plea
Their bond to cancel, or their vows recant:
I go to meet him. Bring the holy rites,
Sire, and rehearse the treaty. Or will I
To *Tartarus* hurl this *Dardan* runagate
From *Asia*—let the *Latins* sit and see—
With my sole arm our common shame rebut;
Or let him hold us as his thralls of war,
And take to bride *Lavinia*.”

With calm breast
Answered *Latinus*: “Peerless-hearted youth,
The loftier mounts thy valour, the more meet
That I stint naught of counsel, weigh with fear
All issues. Thine is thy sire *Daunus’* realm,
And many a war-won city; nor lack I
*Latinus* gold or the goodwill to give.
In *Latium’s* and *Laurentum’s* realm are yet
Maids, nor of race to shame thee. Let me strip
The ungentle utterance bare of all disguise;
And thou in soul absorb it: unto none,
Who heretofore came wooing, might I wed
My daughter; so sang gods alike and men.
Won o’er by love of thee, won o’er by claim
Of kinship, and my sorrowing consort’s tears,
I brake all fetters, plucked from her true lord
The plighted bride, and flew to impious arms.
Thenceforth what perils, what wars pursue me still,
*Turnus*, thou seest, yea, and what mighty toils
Thyself art first to suffer. On stricken field
Twice conquered, scarce within our walls we guard
The hopes of *Italy*; *Tiber-waves* are yet
Warm with our blood, the wide plain white with bones.
Why drift I back so oft? What madness turns
My purpose? If, the light of *Turnus* quenched,
I stand prepared to welcome them as friends,
Why rather, while he lives, not stay the strife?
What will thy *Rutule* kinsmen say, what all
In *Italy* beside them, if to death—
Fortune refute the word!—I thee betray,
Seeking our daughter and alliance? Mark
War’s shifting chances; pity thine old sire,
Whom now his native *Ardea* far aloof
Holds sorrowing.” With such words he bends no whit
The fury of *Turnus*; it but mounts the more,
Grown worse with healing. When his lips at length
Got utterance, he begins: “Prithee, good sire,
The load of care, that for my sake thou hast,
Lay for my sake aside, and suffer me
To pledge my life for honour. Our hand too
Can scatter darts, and wield no weakling sword;
When we too strike, blood follows. Nowise near
Will be his goddess-mother with a cloud
To shield the recreant, woman-like, and hide
Her form in empty shadows.”

But the queen,
At these new terms of battle sore dismayed,
Stood weeping, and, as one resolved to die,
Clave to her fiery son. “By these my tears,
O *Turnus*, and if aught still touch thy heart
Of reverence for *Amata*—thou art now
Sole hope and solace of my sad old age;
*Latinus’* honour and imperial sway
Rest in thy keeping; upon thee alone
Leans all our tottering house—one boon I beg,
Forbear to fight the *Teucrians*. In yon strife
What doom soe’er awaits thee, waits no less,
*Turnus*, for me: the selfsame hour will I
Quit the loathed light, nor with a captive’s eyes
Look on *Aeneas* as my daughter’s lord.”
*Lavinia* heard her mother’s voice with cheek
Flaming and tear-suffused; for a deep flush
Kindled and o’er her burning features ran:
Even as if *Indian* ivory one should stain
With blood-red purple, or as lilies white
Blush with the blended rose; such hues o’erspread
The maiden’s features. He, with love distraught,
Fastens his eyes upon the maid. He burns
The more for battle, and briefly thus bespeaks
*Amata*: “Follow me not with tears, I pray,
Or with these dark forebodings to the war’s
Grim strife, O mother; for *Turnus* is not free
To bid death tarry. *Idmon*, do thou bear
This message—nowise welcome—from my lips
To *Phrygia’s* tyrant: soon as morrow’s dawn
With crimson chariot-wheel shall flush the sky,
Let him not *Teucrian* against *Rutule* lead;
Rest *Rutule* arms and *Teucrian*; that we twain
With our own blood may set a term to strife,
And on that field *Lavinia’s* hand be won.”
So saying, he swiftly got him home, and there
Calls for his steeds, and views them with delight
Snorting before him, which, a glorious gift,
Erst to *Pilumnus* *Orithyia* gave,
To out-vie snows in whiteness, winds in speed.
Around them, bustling, stand the charioteers,
Clap with their hollow hands the sounding chests,
And comb the maned necks. A corslet then
He binds about his shoulders, stiff with gold
And pale-hued *orichalc*, and to his use
Fits sword and shield, and red-plumed helmet-spikes;
Sword, which the lord of fire himself had forged
For his sire *Daunus*, and had dipped white-hot
In *Stygian* water. Last, a mighty spear,
As it stood propped against a column vast
Amid the hall, *Auruncan Actor’s* spoil,
Strongly he seized, and shook the quivering shaft,
Crying aloud: “O spear, that never yet
Hast balked my bidding, now the hour is come;
Thee mightiest *Actor* once, now *Turnus* wields;
Grant me with doughty hand on earth to stretch
The effeminate *Phrygian*, shatter and rend ope
His corslet, and defile with dust the locks
Curled with hot iron, and reeking-moist with myrrh.”
So raves he, fury-driven; from all his face
Shoot fiery sparks; his eager eyes flash flame:
As when a bull, against some battle-bout
Uplifts a fearful bellowing, and for proof
Flings wrath into his horns, and butts against
A tree-trunk, and provokes the air with blows,
Or, scattering sand, makes prelude of the fray.
*Aeneas* no less, girt in his mother’s gear,
Now fiercely whets the war-god in his heart,
And kindles into wrath, right glad the while
That thus, truce proffered, shall the strife be stayed.
Then comforts he his comrades, soothes the fear
Of sad *Iulus*, teaching them of fate,
And unto King *Latinus* bids return
Sure answer, and the terms of peace declare.
Scarce was the next dawn sprinkling with new ray
The mountain-tops, what time from *Ocean’s* deep
Up-spring the sun-steeds, and breathe forth the light
Through lifted nostrils, when both *Rutule* folk
And *Teucrian* ’neath their mighty city-walls
Make ready and mete out the battle-ground,
And hearths and grassy altars thereamidst
Rear to their common gods. Others the while
Bring freshet-wave and fire, girt apron-wise,
Brow-bound with vervain. The *Ausonian* host
Move onward, and in ranks close-banded pour
Through the thronged portals. Here in unlike arms
Speeds all the *Trojan* and *Tyrrhenian* host,
Even as at war’s stern bidding, ranged in mail.
Amid their thousands to and fro the chiefs
Hover, in pride of purple and of gold,
*Mnestheus*, of old *Assaracus* the seed,
And stout *Asilas*, and, from *Neptune* sprung,
*Messapus* the steed-tamer. Either host,
At trumpet-call to its own ground retire,
Fix spears in earth, and lay their shields aslant.
Then eager-thronging matrons, a mixed crowd
Of folk defenceless and infirm old men,
Fill all the towers and house-roofs; other some
Hard by the lofty portals stand at gaze.
But *Juno* from the hill, hight *Alban* now,
Then nameless, without fame or glory, peered
Forth on the plain, and either host beheld,
*Laurentine*, *Trojan*, and *Latinus’* town.
Straightway to *Turnus’* sister thus she spake—
Goddess to goddess—who hath power o’er pools
And sounding streams; such honour had high *Jove*,
The King of heaven, for theft of maidenhead
With hallowing hand assigned her: “Nymph,” she cried,
“Glory of rivers, to my heart most dear,
Whoever to high-souled *Jove’s* unthankful bed
Of *Latin* maids have mounted, thee, thou knowest,
O’er all have I preferred, for thee with joy
Found part and place in heaven: now learn thy grief,
*Juturna*, that thou blame not me. So far
As Fortune seemed to suffer, Fate allow
Good hap to *Latium*, I have guarded well
Thy town and *Turnus*: now I see him rush
Ill-matched upon his fate, and lo! the hour
Of destiny draws near, and force malign.
This fight, this treaty, never can mine eyes
Endure to look on. For thy brother thou,
If aught thou durst of more effectual aid,
On! it becomes thee. Happier days belike
Shall follow misery.” Ere she ceased, the tears
Burst from *Juturna’s* eyes, and with her hand
Thrice, four times o’er, she smote her lovely breast.
“No time for tears,” *Saturnian Juno* cries:
“Hie thee with speed, thy brother snatch from death,
If any way thou mayest, or else wake war,
Dash from their hands the plighted peace: ’tis I
Bid brave it.” And, so warned, she left her there
Doubting, wit-wildered by the baleful blow.
Meanwhile the kings ride forth, *Latinus* first,
Mighty of stature, on a four-horse car,
About whose temples gleam twelve golden rays,
Badge of the Sun, his grandsire: *Turnus* next
With snow-white pair comes charioted, his hand
Twin javelins brandishing, broad-tipped with steel.
Then Prince *Aeneas*, of *Rome’s* stem the root,
Blazing with starry shield, celestial arms,
And at his side *Ascanius*, of great *Rome*
The after-hope, move onward from the camp;
While pure-robed priest a two-year sheep unshorn,
With offspring of a bristly boar hath brought,
And by the blazing altars set the beasts.
They, with eyes turned toward the rising Sun,
Scatter salt meal from hand, and graze with knife
The foreheads of the victims, and pour wine
Upon the altars. Drawing then his sword,
Thus good *Aeneas* prays: “Now may the Sun
Attest my utterance, and this land for which
I have essayed such mighty toils to bear,
The Sire omnipotent, and his consort thou,
*Saturnia*, goddess, now at last, I pray,
More favourable; and *Mavors* the renowned,

# The Aeneid XII

Who dost all wars with power paternal sway; 180
And Floods I call, and Fountains, and what Awe
Dwells in high heaven, what gods in the blue sea:
If victory to Ausonian Turnus happen,
We vanquished will depart— so stands the bond—
Hence to Evander’s town; Iulus then
Shall quit the soil, nor e'er in after-time,
Armed for new war, Aeneas’ sons return,
Or vex this kingdom with invasion. But,
If victory will the battle to our hand—
As I deem rather, and so seal it heaven!—
Nor shall Italian at my bidding bow
To Teucrian, nor list I to reign; let both,
Unconquered, beneath equal laws unite
In everlasting bonds of amity. 191
My gods I’ll give them, and my sacred things;
The sword Latinus, as my sire, must sway,
And, as my sire, the daily round of State:
For me the Teucrians shall build walls, my town
Be named from fair Lavinia.” So spake first
Aeneas, and after him Latinus thus,
Eyes raised to heaven, and right hand starward
stretched:
“Now by the self-same Earth, Sea, Stars, I swear,
Aeneas, and by Latona’s double brood,
And two-faced Janus, and the might of gods
Infernal, and relentless Pluto’s shrine; 199
Let the Sire hear, who doth on treaties set
His seal of thunder. I these altars touch,
The flames and powers betwixt us I adjure:
No lapse of time shall break for Italy
This covenant of peace, betide what may,
Nor any force me from my purpose turn;
Nay, not though earth into the waves be washed
In one blind deluge, and the vault of heaven
Poured into Tartarus: as this sceptre here”—
For sceptre in right hand he chanced to wield—
“Shall never into light-leaved twigs expand,
Or shady spray, since in the greenwood once,
Lopped from the parent-stem, beneath the axe
It shed both boughs and foliage; erst a tree,
Now by the craftsman’s handiwork made o’er,
Bound in fair brass, for Latin sires to hold.” 211

So spake they, pledging mutual vows of peace,
Amid the gazing lords, then solemnly
Let bleed the sacred victims o’er the flame,
And flay the flesh yet quivering, and anon
With laden trenchers heap the altars high.
But long ere this to Rutule eyes ill-matched
Appears the conflict, and their bosoms heave
With manifold emotion more and more,
As closer seen the odds of strength they scan. 218
Swells their disquietude withal to mark
How softly Turnus to the altar stepped,
His lowly reverent mien, his downcast eyes,
The wasted cheek, the youthful form so wan.
But when Juturna, when his sister, saw
Whispers wax rife, the crowd with wavering hearts
Irresolute, amid the ranks in form
Like unto Camers— who, of hero-strain,
Was from a sire of peerless valour sprung,
Himself no laggard warrior— 'mid the ranks
She plunges, and, well witting of the task,
Scatters wide rumour, and bespeaks them thus: 228
“Blush ye not, Rutules, thus to jeopardize
One life for all, and all so valiant? Say
In numbers are we overmatched, or might?
Trojans, Arcadians, these are all they boast;
See! and the fate-led bands Etruria’s wrath
Hurled upon Turnus. Every second man
Grappled we them, scarce each should find a foe.
He doubtless, winged with glory, to the gods,
Gods to whose altars he devotes his life,
Shall soar, ride living on the lips of men;
We, reft of home, to haughty lords must bow,
Who thus sit idly, cumberers of the field.” 237
Fired by such words, now more and more up-blazed
The warriors’ purpose, and from rank to rank
Speeds on the murmur; even Laurentum’s sons,
Even Latium’s folk are changed. Who late for rest
From battle, and safety for their fortune, sighed,
Now wish for arms, implore the league undone,
And pity Turnus and his cruel fate.
Hereto another and a mightier spell
Juturna adds, and shows a sign in heaven,
Than which no cause, more potent to confound,
Fooled omen-wise the hearts of Italy. 246
For as in ruddy sky Jove’s tawny bird
Flew chasing water-fowl, a clamorous rout
In wing-borne column, suddenly he swooped
Down on the stream, and seized a lordly swan
Ruthless in taloned gripe. Italia’s folk
Gave eager heed, as all the birds at once
Wheeled screaming, wondrous to be behold! and hid
The heaven with wings, and in a serried cloud
Urge through the air their foe, till, overborne
By the sheer weight of onset, he gave o’er,
Into the flood let fall his loosened prey,
And vanished amid cloudy depths of heaven. 256
The Rutules hail the omen with a shout,
And free their hands for battle; and first out-spoke
Augur Tolumnius: “This, ay this it was,
So oft my prayers desired: I greet the call,
And own the gods herein; follow my lead,
Even mine, and seize the sword, ye miserable,
Whom yon rapacious stranger frights with war,
Like silly birds, and rudely ravages
Your borders. He will turn, trim sail, and fly
Far o’er the deep. With one heart close your ranks,
And fight for rescue of your ravished king.” 265
He spake, and, dashing forward, hurled his lance
Full at the foe; the hurtling cornel hissed,
And cleft the air, and erred not. Hard upon,
Rose a vast shout; through all the welded ranks
Confusion ran, and hearts beat fiery-fast.
As sped the spear, right in its onward track
Stood grouped nine goodly brethren, borne alike
Of one true Tuscan mother to her lord
Gylippus of Arcadia. One of these,
Where the sewn belt pressed midmost of his bulk
Hard on the belly, and the ribs’ edges felt
The buckle’s bite— a youth of peerless form
In glittering armour— through the flank it pierced,
And on the dun sand stretched him. At the sight
His brethren, a bold band, now fired with grief,
Some drawing sword, some snatching darts to hurl,
Rush blindly onward. The Laurentine ranks
Dash forth to meet them; from the opposers’ side
Trojans, Agyllines, and Arcadia’s host
Girt in gay arms, one turbid torrent pour,
All, each, on fire to let the sword decide. 282
They have stripped the altars; a thick javelin-storm
Scours all the sky; the steel sleet drives apace.
The bowls, the hearths, they hale away: fast flies
Latinus, and bears off his baffled gods,
Leaving the league undone. Some harness cars,
Some hurl to horse, and with drawn swords are there.
Messapus, eager to confound the league,
Spurs at and scares Aulestes, Tuscan king,
Dight with the kingly diadem; but he,
Luckless, leaps backward, strikes the altar-stone
Behind him, and rolls head and shoulders o’er. 288
Up speeds Messapus fiery-swift, with spear
Huge as a beam, and towering upon steed
Deals him, for all his prayers, one deadly blow
Downward, and cries: “He hath it: here behold
A nobler victim to the high gods given!”
Italia’s folk throng round him, and despoil
The yet warm body. Then Corynaeus snatched
A charred brand from the altar, and therewith,
As Ebysus rode up and sought to strike,
Dashed in his face the flame; his mighty beard
Blazed brightly, and sent forth a burning stench.
Following, he clutches in left hand the locks
Of his dazed foe, with push of bended knee
Pins him to earth, and buries the stark blade
Deep in his side. As shepherd Alsus rushed
Through showering darts along the battle’s front,
Lo! Podalirius with bare blade pursues
And overhangs him; whom with axe swung back
Full in his face, he cleft from brow to chin
Drenching his armour with wide-spattered gore. 308
Stern rest and iron slumber seal his eyes,
And their orbs close in everlasting night.
But good Aeneas, stretching forth his hand
Unarmed the while, bare-headed, with loud shouts
Cried ever to his men: “Why storm ye forth?
Whence springs this sudden quarrel? O curb your ire!
The league is stricken, and all its laws allowed;
I only may do battle; balk me not,
And have no fear: this hand shall consummate
The treaty; by these rites is Turnus mine.” 317
As thus he spake, even in mid utterance, lo!
Wing-borne against him glides a whizzing shaft,
Launched by what hand, who steered its stormy
speed,
Knows no man, nor what power, or chance, or god,
Glory so boundless to the Rutule brought;
His fame of that high deed lay locked from sight,
And none e'er boasted of Aeneas’ wound.
When Turnus marked Aeneas quit the host,
The chiefs dismayed, with sudden hope he fires,
Anon cries out for horses and for arms,
Springs proudly on the car, and grasps the reins.
In swift career full many a mighty form
He gives to death, or tumbles them half-slain.
Crushes whole ranks beneath his car, or plucks
Spear after spear, and hurls them on the fliers. 330
As when at furious speed, anigh the banks
Of *Hebrus’* icy wave, blood-dabbled *Mars*
Clangs on his shield, and, rousing war, lets loose
His raging steeds; they scour the open plain
Swifter than south or west wind; utmost *Thrace*
Groans with their hoof-beat; all around him rush
Dark-frowning Fear and Wraths and Treacheries,
The god’s attendant train: so eager goads
Turnus his smoking steeds amid the fray,
Trampling the foe slain piteously; each hoof
At furious speed spirts showers of ruddy dew,
And ’neath their tread the sand is caked with gore. 340
Now Sthenelus to slaughter hath he given,
And Thamyrus and Pholus, this and this
Encountering close, that other from afar;
From far both Glaucus too and Lades, sons
Of Imbrasus, whom Imbrasus himself
In *Lycia* reared, and with like arms arrayed
To fight as footmen, or out-ride the winds.
Elsewhere Eumedes hies him to the fray,
The war-famed son of ancient Dolon he,
His grandsire’s name, his sire’s own doughty deeds
Renewing, who erst, upon the Danaan camp,
To creep and make espial, for wage dared ask
*Pelides’* chariot; with far other wage
Dowered for his daring by great *Tydeus’* son,
He to *Achilles’* team no more aspires. 352
Him Turnus eyeing afar on open plain,
First with light dart through length of air pursues,
Then checks the twin yoked steeds, and leaps from car
To find him fallen half-lifeless, on his neck
Plants foot, and wrests from his right hand the sword,
And in his throat dyes deep the glittering blade,
And thus withal speaks over him: “Lie there,
Trojan, and measure those *Hesperian* fields
Thou cam’st to fight for: lo! such meed they win,
So found their walls, who dare me to the fray.”
Next with hurled spear, to bear him company,
He sends Asbutes, Chloreus, Sybaris,
Dares, Thersilochus, and Thymoetes, falling
Prone from the neck of his unruly steed. 364
And as when *Thracian Boreas* with his blast
Roars o’er the deep *Aegean*, and pursues
Its billows to the shore, where swoop the winds,
The clouds scud fast through heaven, so yield the ranks
To Turnus, where he cleaves a path, and all
Their battle is swept backwards; his own speed
Impels him, and the breeze his chariot breasts
Tosses his flying plume. Such fierce assault
And stormy arrogance Phegeus might not brook;
He crossed the car’s path, grasped and wrenched
aside
The mouths o’ the mad steeds foaming at the bit: 375
So dragged, and hanging to the yoke, the broad
Spear-head uncovered found him, and its thrust
Broke ope the corslet’s double-woven mail,
And tasted of his body. He nathless,
Shield set before him, facing still the foe,
From his bare blade sought succour, when the wheel
And onward-hurrying axle prone to earth
Smote him, and Turnus, stooping, with his sword
’Twixt helmet-edge and corslet’s topmost rim
Lopped off his head, and left the trunk to lie. 382
While Turnus thus triumphant o’er the plain
Deals havoc, Mnestheus and Achates true,
Ascanius at their side, in camp have set
Aeneas, now bleeding, every second step
Propped on his long spear. He, in rage of soul,
Striving to pluck forth barb and splintered shaft,
Calls for what aid lies nearest: let them cleave
With a broad battle-blade, probe deep, the wound
Where the barb lurks, and send him back to war. 390
And now *Iapis*, son of *Iasus*,
Dear before all to *Phoebus*, draws anigh,
Whom erst *Apollo*, by keen love subdued,
With his own arts and gifts— prophetic lore,
The lyre, and arrows swift— was fain to bless.
He, to protract his sire’s appointed span
Now nigh to death, the power of herbs to know,
The healer’s skill, chose rather, and to ply
A silent art, inglorious. Chafing sore,
Propped on his mighty spear, ’mid a vast throng
Of warriors, with *Iulus* grieving nigh,
Untroubled by their tears, Aeneas stood.
The aged sire, his garb Paeonian-wise
Flung back and girt about him, with deft hand,
And *Phoebus’* herbs of power, makes much ado
Vainly, with vain endeavour at the shaft
Pulls, or with biting pincer grips the barb. 407
Fortune no clue, no aid his patron-god
*Apollo* lends him; and now fiercer grows
The alarm of battle, and more nigh the bane.
They see the heaven up-stand in solid dust;
On come the horsemen, and amid their camp
Javelins fall thick and fast. A dismal shout
Is borne to heaven of those that fight and fall
’Neath the stern war-god’s hand. Then, mother-like,
Smit to the heart by her son’s cruel pain,
Venus from Cretan Ida culls a stalk
Of dittany, with downy leaves thick-fledged,
And purple flower; the wild goats know it well,
When winged arrows have fastened in their side. 415
This bare she down, veiled in a mantling mist,
And tinges therewithal fresh water, poured
In bright-brimmed vessel, darkly drugging it,
And sprinkles life-juice from ambrosia bled,
And sweet-breathed panacea. With that lymph,
Unwitting, old *Iapis* bathed the wound;
When lo! from out the limbs all pain hath passed,
All gush of blood in the deep wound is stayed;
And at a touch the arrow unimpelled
Out-falling, his old strength returns anew. 425
“Arms for the hero, quick! Why tarry ye?”
Loud cries *Iapis*, and first fires their wrath
Against the foe. “Man’s power and master-craft
Work not such issues, nor doth hand of mine
Save thee, Aeneas; some mightier one, some god
Is operant here, and unto mightier deeds
Restores thee.” Ravenous for the fray meanwhile
He, right and left, had sheathed his legs in gold,
Spurning all checks, and brandishing his spear.
When shield to side, corslet to back were braced,
About Ascanius his mailed arms he flung,
And lightly kissed him through the helm, and said
“O boy, learn valour and true toil from me,
Fortune from others. Now shall my right hand
Shield thee in fight, and lead where high rewards
Await the winning: hereafter look that thou,
When ripening years have made thee perfect man,
Be mindful, and the exemplars of thy race
Recalling, let Aeneas for thy sire,
Hector thine uncle, be thy spurs to fame.” 440
So having said, forth from the gate he strode
Gigantic, shaking his portentous spear:
Antheus and Mnestheus therewithal rush on
With serried column; from the abandoned camp
Streams the whole host. Then all the plain is blent
In one blind dust-cloud; the affrighted earth
Trembles beneath their foot-tread. Turnus saw
From an opposing height, as on they came;
The Ausonians saw, and through their inmost bones
Ran a chill shudder: instant before all
The Latin host Juturna heard the sound,
Knew it, and fled in terror. He speeds on,
Hurrying his dark line o’er the open plain.
As, when with bursting squall a hurricane
Drives landward o’er mid-ocean, hapless hinds
Shudder, afar foreboding; it will bring
Downfall to trees, destruction to the crops,
Whelm all in one wide havoc; the winds fly
Bearing its sound before it to the beach: 455
So the *Rhoeteian* chief his war-host speeds
Full on the foe; in wedges dense they close,
Massed at his side. Thymbraeus smites with sword
Osiris huge, Mnestheus Arcetius;
Achates hews in sunder Epulo,
And Gyas Ufens; falls Tolumnius too,
The Augur, who had first hurled hostile dart.
The cry mounts heaven, and Rutules, chased in turn,
Their backs with flight dust-mantled, scour the plain. 463
Himself, nor deigns he strike to death who fled,
Nor follow up who met him, foot to foot,
Or wielding javelins: Turnus, him alone,
He tracks, still circling through the battle’s night,
Bids him alone to combat. Hereupon
With fear heart-stricken, Juturna, the man-maid,
Flings forth Metiscus, Turnus’ charioteer,
From ’twixt the reins, and leaves him far behind
Fallen from the pole, so leaps into his seat,
And, grasping, guides herself the wavy thongs,
Metiscus’ voice, form, arms, assuming all. 472
Even as a black swift through the mansion flits
Of some rich lord, and skims the lofty hall
With circling pinion, for her noisy brood
Some tiny morsels gleaning, and now whirrs
Adown the empty corridors, and now
Round the moist fish-ponds; with like course to hers,
Juturna through the thickest foemen drives,
Careering o’er the field with flying car.
Now here, now there, her brother she displays
In triumph, yet suffers not in fight to close,
But whirls far off away. Aeneas no less
To meet him thrids the winding maze of war,
And tracks his steps, and through the sundered ranks
With mighty voice defies him. Oft as he
Spied out the foe, and strove afoot to match
The flying hooves, so oft Juturna wheeled
And turned the chariot. Ah! what can he do?
Tossed vainly on a restless tide, and called
Now this, now that way by conflicting cares! 499
At him Messapus, for his left hand chanced
To hold two supple javelins tipped with steel,
Up-speeding lightly, levelled and let fly
One with unerring aim. Aeneas stopped,
Huddled behind his shield, and on one knee
Sank; yet the swift spear took his helmet-top,
And smote away the crest-plume. Then up-surged
His ire, and, by their treachery constrained,
While steeds and chariot whirl away from sight,
Jove and the altars of their outraged league
Invoking oft to witness, ’mid the ranks
He bursts, and, terrible in victorious strength,
At last awakens indiscriminate
Grim carnage, and lets loose the reins of wrath. 508
What god may now in song for me tell o’er
The tale of horrors, diverse forms of death,
And fall of chieftains, whom o’er all the plain
Now Turnus, now the Trojan hero, drives?
Was it thy will, great Jove, that folk with folk,
To everlasting peace ordained, should rush
So furiously together? Aeneas meets
Sucro the Rutule— and that fight first checked
The Teucrian onset— but, not long detained,
Takes him in flank, and, by death’s quickest way,
Through ribs and breast-work drives his reeking
blade.
Amycus and Diores, brothers twain,
Turnus unhorses, and confronts on foot;
One, still approaching, with long lance he strikes,
And one with sword-blade; the lopped heads of both
He bears, blood-dripping, fastened to his car.
Talos and Tanais and Cethegus brave,
Three at one rush, that other sends to death,
And sad Onites, Echionian name,
Offspring of Peridia. This strikes down
The brethren sent from Lycian land, and fields
Loved of Apollo, and, loathing war in vain,
Youthful Menoetes the Arcadian, who
By Lerna’s fishy stream had erst his craft
And full poor home, nor cares of greatness knew,
Whose father needs must hire the land he sowed. 520
As when two fires from points opposing fall
On a dry forest and brakes of rustling bay,
Or as, down-tumbling from the mountain-heights,
Roar foamy rivers, and, swept seaward, strew
Each its own path with ruin: so, swift as they,
Aeneas and Turnus through the battle rush;
Now, now wrath boils within them, and nigh burst
The indomitable hearts; now with main strength
They hurl them upon wounds. Murranus, still
Mouthing of sires and grandsires, names of yore—
A whole line downward traced through Latium’s kings—
Aeneas with whirl of a huge craggy rock
Dashed headlong from his car, and stretched on earth;
So lying ’neath reins and yoke, the rolling wheels
Dragged him, and with quick hoof-beat o’er his head
Trod the swift steeds, unmindful of their lord. 537
The other met Hyllus, as he rushed along
Immeasurably exulting in his pride,
And at his gold-bound temples hurls a dart;
Pierced helm and brain the weapon, and there stuck.
Nor could thine arm from Turnus win thee free,
Cretheus, of Greeks the bravest, nor his gods
Shield their Cupencus, as Aeneas drew nigh;
His bosom meets the invading bolt, nor aught
’Steads the doomed wretch his brazen buckler’s stay.
Thee too Laurentum’s plain, O Aeolus,
Saw perish, and spread thy bulk on earth; thou fall’st,
Whom Argive armies, nor Achilles’ self,
Wrecker of Priam’s realm, availed to slay. 545
Here was thy bourne of death; ’neath Ida’s hill
Thy stately home; thy stately home where lies
Lyrnesus, in Laurentum’s soil thy tomb.
Yea, the whole lines, now turning— Latins all,
All Dardans, Mnestheus and Serestus keen,
Messapus, steed-subduer, Asilas bold,
The Tuscan ranks, Evander’s Arcad horse—
Strain each to do man’s uttermost; no pause,
No respite, but one giant tug of war. 555
Now from his beauteous mother was the thought
Borne on Aeneas to draw nigh the walls,
Upon the city launch his host amain,
And with swift slaughter Latium’s folk confound.
As through the ranks from point to point he roves,
Still tracking Turnus with wide-circling eye,
He marks the city from all that conflict free,
At ease and unmolested. Fires his heart
Forthwith the vision of a mightier fray;
Mnestheus, Sergestus, and Serestus bold,
His chiefs, he summons, and plants him on a mound,
Where all the remnant of the Teucrian host
Throng dense around, but loosed not hold of shield
Or javelin. Midmost on the hillock’s height
Erect he cries: “Let naught my bidding stay—
Jove with us stands— nor yet be any man,
That sudden seem the call, more slack to go.
To-day this city, the cause of war, itself
Latinus’ seat of sovereignty, will I—
Except they take my bridle in their mouth,
Confess a conqueror’s bidding— topple o’er,
And level with the dust her smoking towers.
Am I to wait, forsooth, till Turnus choose
To bide our onset, and, once beaten, brook
The fight’s renewal? Here stands the head and front,
O countrymen, of this accursed war.
Bring torches quick! with tongues of fire reclaim
The treaty.” He had said, when all, as one,
With emulous hearts, wedge-welded, on the walls
In dense array bear down, and in a trice
Lo! ladders, and the flash of sudden fire!
Some, scattering for the gates, who front them slay;
Some hurl the steel, and darken heaven with darts;
Aeneas, his right hand toward the rampart raised,
Chides with loud voice Latinus, in their van,
Bids heaven attest him forced again to fight,
The folk of Italy twice o’er his foes,
And snapped the second treaty. Strife up-springs
Betwixt the fluttered townsmen; some bid ope
The city-gates, let in the Dardans, yea,
Would to the ramparts hale their very king;
Others bring arms, and haste to man the walls:
As, when some shepherd hath a swarm of bees
Tracked to their hiding in the caverned crag,
With smarting smoke he fills it; they, within,
Scared for their safety, through the waxen camp
Dart wildly, and with loud buzzings whet their wrath;
The black stench rolls from cell to cell; anon
Is heard a hum, rock-stifled, and smoke soars
Into the void of air. 592

This further fate
Befell the war-worn Latins, and with grief
Shook the whole city to its base. The queen,
When from her towers she sees the approaching foe,
Her walls assailed, fire to the house-roofs fly,
No Rutule host, no sign of Turnus near
In arms to meet them, deems, unhappy soul,
Her champion quenched in onset, and, distraught
With sudden agony, shrieks against herself,
As cause and guilty source of all their woe;
Then in a frenzy of anguish uttering
Mad words a many, resolved to die, she grasps
And rends her purple raiment, and knits fast
To the high beam a noose of hideous death. 603
Whose woful end when Latium’s women knew
Lavinia first, her daughter, with rude clutch
Tore flower-like locks and vermeil cheek, then
The rest around her throng, one frenzied rout;
Rings the wide palace with their wail. From hence
Through the whole city the dark tidings spread;
Hearts sink; Latinus with rent raiment goes,
Stunned by his consort’s fate, the city’s doom,
Soiling his white hair with unsightly dust. 613
But Turnus, battling on the plain’s last verge,
Still drives the minished stragglers, more and more
Slackening the while, and ever less and less
Exulting in his steeds’ victorious course.
Blent with blind terrors came the wind-borne cry,
And from the city smote his straining ears
Sound of confusion, and no joyful hum.
“Ah me! what mighty anguish shakes the walls?
What shrill cry from the city speeds afar?” 621
So saying, half frantic he draws rein, and halts.
To whom his sister, wearing still the form
Of charioteer Metiscus, as she swayed
Steeds, reins, and chariot, thus gives counter-word:
“This way pursue we yet the sons of Troy,
Turnus, where quickest victory clears a path;
Others there are may strike for house and home.
Aeneas falls hotly on Italia’s folk,
And spreads the broil of battle; hurl we too
Fierce havoc on the Teucrians: nor in fame,
Nor tale of dead, shalt thou come worse away.” 630
“Sister, long since I knew thee,” Turnus cried,
“Who first by stratagem didst mar the league,
And plunge into the fight; and vainly now
Wouldst cloak thy godhead. But by whom wert sent
From high Olympus, such sore toils to bear?
Was it thy brother’s piteous death to see?
For what can I? What pledge of safety yet
Doth Fortune yield me? Nay, these very eyes
Saw perish, and with my name upon his lips,
Murranus, dearest-left of all my friends,
Mighty, and vanquished by a mighty wound. 640
Fell ill-starred Ufens, not to see my shame;
His corse, his arms, are now the Teucrians’ spoil.
And shall I suffer— that alone was left—
Our home’s upheaval? nor with blows rebut
The taunts of Drances? Shall I fly?— this land
See Turnus play the runagate? Is death
A lot so grievous? O ye Powers of hell,
Befriend me, for heaven’s face is turned away.
To you, a stainless shade, will I descend,
Witless of that foul wrong, nor ever yet
Degenerate from my mighty sires of old.”
Scarce had he said when through the foemen’s
midst
Lo! Saces, borne upon a foamy steed,
Comes rushing, full in face an arrow-wound.
By name conjuring Turnus as he flies:
“Turnus, in thee is our last hope of life;
Have pity on thine own. Aeneas in arms
Lightens and thunders, threatening to hurl down,
Raze utterly, the tall Italian towers;
Even now their firebrands to the house-roofs fly.
On thee their looks, their eyes, the Latins bend;
The King himself, Latinus, muttering, doubts
Whom to call son, to whose alliance turn.
Aye, and the queen, thine ever staunchest friend,
Self-slain, hath fled in terror from the light. 660
Messapus, keen Atinas, at the gates
Are our sole props of battle. Around these
The serried lines throng close, and with bare blades
Bristles the iron harvest: thou the while
Whirlest thy chariot o’er an empty plain.”
Wildered with manifold imaginings
Stood Turnus, mutely gazing; in one heart
Seethe boundless shame, and madness mixed with
grief,
And frenzy-goaded love, and conscious worth.
Soon as, the darkness from his heart dispelled, 670

# THE AENEID XII

> Light dawned afresh; toward the walls he bent  
> His burning eyeballs stormily, and glanced  
> Back from his chariot on the mighty town;
> 
> When lo! a spire of wreathed flame rolled on  
> From floor to floor, went wavering up to heaven,  
> And clasped the tower, the tower which his own hand  
> Of welded beams had reared, and under it  
> Set wheels, and from aloft high gangways hung.
> 
> "Now, sister, now Fate masters us; forbear  
> To hold me loitering; follow me where heaven  
> And cruel fortune call. Resolved am I  
> To grapple with Aeneas, resolved to bear  
> The utmost of death's bitterness; no more  
> Shalt see me shamed, my sister. Thus far first  
> Suffer the madman to give madness way."
> 
> He spake, and swiftly leapt from car to plain,  
> And dashed through foes, through javelins, and there left  
> His sister sorrowing, and at furious speed  
> Cleaves the mid battle-ranks. As when a crag  
> From mountain-top shoots headlong, torn away  
> By the wind's blast—whether with stormy shower  
> Washed free, or loosened by slow lapse of years—  
> With mighty rush relentless the mass swings  
> Down the abyss, and riots o'er the plain,  
> Men, flocks, and forests rolled along with it;
> 
> So rushes Turnus through the scattered ranks  
> On to the city-walls, where streams the earth  
> Deepest with torrent-gore, and sings the wind  
> With missiles, and there beckons with his hand,  
> And with loud voice begins: "Rutules, forbear,  
> And hold your darts, ye Latins; mine to-day  
> The award of Fortune, whatsoe'er it be.  
> Let me—'tis meeter— for your broken troth  
> Sole penance pay, my sword alone decide."
> 
> The mid ranks part asunder and make room.  
> But Prince Aeneas, hearing Turnus' name,  
> Forsakes the wall, forsakes the lofty towers,  
> Spurns all delay, breaks off all enterprise,  
> Exultant, and clangs terribly his arms:  
> Vast as Mount Athos, or as Eryx vast;  
> Old Apennine no vaster, when he roars  
> Through all his quivering holm-oaks, and aloft  
> With snowy crest soars jubilant to heaven.
> 
> Now Rutules, Trojans, and Italians all  
> Turn emulous eyes—who held the lofty towers,  
> Nor less who battered at the walls below—  
> And shield from shoulder drop. Latinus even  
> Stood all amazed those mighty ones to see,  
> Born in far distant climes, met man to man,  
> To try the sword's arbitrament. But they,  
> Soon as the plain gave open space, dart forth,  
> Hurl from afar their spears, and with loud clang  
> Of brazen bucklers dash into the fray.
> 
> Earth groans, and thick and fast the sword-strokes shower,  
> Valour with chance commingling. Even as when  
> On mighty Sila or Taburnus' top  
> Two bulls for fierce encounter each on each  
> Rush, brow to brow; the affrighted keepers fly;  
> The herd stands hushed in fear; the heifers muse  
> Which of the twain shall lord it o'er the grove,  
> Which all the kine must follow; they mix amain  
> Blow upon blow, and gore with butting horns;  
> Blood streams o'er neck and shoulder; all the grove  
> Rebellows with the roar: not otherwise  
> Trojan Aeneas and the Daunian chief  
> Clash shields together; the vast din fills heaven.
> 
> Two scales at equipoise in his own hand  
> Holds Jupiter, and sets therein of both  
> The diverse destinies—whom travail dooms,  
> Whose weight with death sinks downward. Hereupon  
> Forth Turnus darts, nor dreaming of mishap  
> Rears his whole height to the uplifted sword,  
> And strikes. Trojans and Latins all a-quake  
> Cry out; both armies stand at eager gaze.  
> But snaps the treacherous weapon, in mid stroke  
> Failing its fiery master, except flight  
> Befriend him. Swifter than the wind he flies  
> At sight of a strange hilt in swordless hand.
> 
> Folk say when first the harnessed battle-car  
> He mounted, his sire's sword in headlong haste  
> Then left behind him, he caught up the brand  
> Of charioteer Metiscus; and, while yet  
> The straggling Teucrians turned their backs in flight,  
> Long time it served him; but with Vulcan's arms  
> Of a god's making matched, the mortal blade  
> Like brittle ice fell shivered at a stroke—  
> Mere splinters glittering on the tawny sand.  
> So Turnus madly scours the plain in flight,  
> And hither, thither, weaves a wayward maze;  
> For round him closed the Teucrians' ring, and here  
> Spreads a waste fen, here girdling ramparts tower.
> 
> Nor less Aeneas, though hindered by the wound,  
> His knees oft fail him, and their speed deny,  
> Pursues and hotly presses, stride by stride,  
> The panting foe: as, when a hound of chase  
> Lights on a stag hemmed in by river-bend,  
> Or hedged about with scare of crimson plumes,  
> With foot and clamorous tongue it plies him; he,  
> Or of the toils, or the steep bank afeared,  
> Darts here, darts there, a thousand ways; but close  
> Clings the keen Umbrian open-mouthed, and seems  
> Now, now to clutch him, and, as though he clutched,  
> Snaps with his jaws, and baffled bites the air.
> 
> Ah! then a shout uprises; marge and mere  
> Re-echo round; all heaven roars back the din.  
> He flying upbraids the while, calls, each by name,  
> The Rutules, clamouring for the sword he knew.  
> Aeneas in turn vows death and present doom,  
> Should one approach, and scares the tremblers more,  
> Threatening to dash their city to the dust,  
> And, wounded, still pursues him. Circles five  
> They measure in their course, as oft again  
> Unravel and retrace them; for not light  
> The prize they seek, nor trivial; the heart's blood  
> And very life of Turnus are at stake.
> 
> A bitter-leaved wild olive, as it chanced,  
> Sacred to Faunus, here had stood, a tree  
> Revered of old by seamen, where they wont,  
> Snatched from the billows, to set gifts, and hang  
> Their votive raiment to Laurentum's god.  
> But Teucrian hands indifferently had shorn  
> The sacred trunk away, thereby to win  
> Clear space for shock of battle. Here stood fixed  
> The lance of Aeneas; hither its own rush  
> Had driven, and in the tough root held it fast.
> 
> The son of Dardanus bent over it,  
> Fain by sheer strength to wrench the weapon free,  
> And follow up with spear, whom catch with speed  
> He could not. Then at last, with terror crazed,  
> Cried Turnus: "Pity me, O Faunus, I pray,  
> And, kind earth, keep the weapon, if I still  
> Held dear your honours, which the Aeneadae  
> Have with foul war polluted." So he spake,  
> Nor to vain prayers invoked the aid of heaven.
> 
> For wrestling, lingering o'er the stubborn stem,  
> No strength availed Aeneas to prise ope  
> The knotty vice. While hard he tugs and strains,  
> Forth darts the Daunian goddess, changed once more  
> To charioteer Metiscus, and restores  
> Her brother the lost sword. Then Venus, wroth  
> At the nymph's unwarranted arrogance, drew near,  
> And from the deep root wrenched the weapon free.  
> So both elate, with arms and courage new,  
> He trusting to his sword, and he with spear  
> Impetuously up-towering, take their stand  
> Face to face, panting, in the lists of war.
> 
> Meanwhile the Lord of heaven's almighty throne  
> To Juno speaks, as from a golden cloud  
> She marks the strife: "Say, what shall be the end,  
> O consort? or what yet remains to do?  
> Full well thou knowest, and dost thyself allow,  
> Heaven claims Aeneas a tutelary god,  
> Fate lifts him to the stars. What schem'st thou yet?  
> With what hope hang'st amid these chilly clouds?  
> A god by mortal wounded—was it meet?  
> Or—for what could Juturna without thee?—  
> In Turnus' hand to set the sword anew,  
> And re-invigorate the vanquished? Nay,  
> Give o'er at length, and bend thee to my prayers;  
> Let not such grief thy silent heart devour,  
> Nor bitter woes from thy sweet lips so oft  
> Return to vex me. Lo! the bound is reached;  
> To chase the Teucrians over land or wave  
> Thou hast had power, to kindle monstrous strife,  
> Mar a fair home, and mix the bridal song  
> With mourning: further venture I forbid."
> 
> Thus Jupiter; and thus with look demure  
> Replies Saturnia: "Even because thy will  
> Was known to me, great Jove, have I forsook  
> Turnus and earth, unwilling; else shouldst thou  
> Not see me thus on my lone airy seat,  
> Patient of foul or fair; but girt with fire  
> I on the battle's very verge had stood  
> Drawing the Teucrians on to deadly fray.
> 
> Juturna—I confess—I moved to aid  
> Her hapless brother, for his life's sake allowed  
> Scope to her daring; not to hurl the dart  
> Or bend the bow; I swear it by the source  
> Of Stygian wave inexorable, sole awe  
> Of binding power vouchsafed to gods above.  
> Well, now I yield, and, loathing, quit the strife.  
> One boon, withholden by no law of fate,  
> For Latium, for thy kindred's majesty,  
> I beg thee: when with happy bridal-rites  
> They pledge the peace—so be it—when now they knit  
> Their terms of treaty, bid them not put by  
> The native name of Latins, nor become  
> Trojans, or pass for Teucrians on men's lips,  
> Nor alien speech assume, nor altered garb.  
> Let Latium, and let Alban kings endure  
> For ages; be there still a Roman stock,  
> Strong with Italian valour. Troy is fallen,  
> And, name with nation, let the fallen lie."
> 
> The Author of mankind and all that is,  
> Smiling made answer: "Jove's own sister thou,  
> And Saturn's other offspring, such wild waves  
> Of passion heav'st within thy bosom's depth!  
> But come, this unavailing wrath allay:  
> Thy suit I grant, and willing let thee win.  
> Ausonia's folk their native tongue shall keep  
> And customs; and, as now, their name shall be;  
> The Teucrians shall but in the mass be merged  
> And settle; I myself will add their rites  
> Of ceremonial worship, and make all  
> Of one tongue, Latins. Hence shall spring a race  
> Blent of Ausonian blood, whom thou shalt see  
> Outsoar mankind, outsoar the very gods,  
> In duty; nor shall any race beside  
> Pay thee like homage." Juno at the word  
> Assents, and with changed purpose, blithe at heart,  
> Anon withdraws from heaven, and quits the cloud.
> 
> This done, the Sire, revolving in his heart  
> Yet more, bestirs him from her brother's aid  
> To part Juturna. There are monsters twain,  
> Yclept the Furies, at one selfsame birth  
> Born, with Megaera's hellish shape, of Night  
> That knows no seasons, and with serpent-coils  
> Wreathed each alike, and dowered with windy wings.  
> These at Jove's throne and on the threshold wait  
> Of the fierce monarch, and whet terror's edge  
> In suffering mortals, whensoe'er heaven's king  
> Launches disease and direful death, or scares  
> With war offending cities. One of these  
> Swiftly from heaven's cope Jupiter sent down,  
> And bade confront Juturna, for a sign.
> 
> She speeds, borne earthward on the hurrying blast.  
> As some cloud-piercing arrow, shot from string,  
> Which Parthian in fell venom-bane hath dipped—  
> Or Parthian or Cydonian—and launched forth,  
> A shaft past healing-power; with strident sound  
> It skims the rushing darkness, known of none;  
> So, journeying earthward, sped the child of Night.  
> When Ilium's host and Turnus' ranks she viewed,  
> Shrunk suddenly into a small bird's shape,  
> Which oft on tomb or lonely roof-top sits,  
> And nightly shrills a late ill-boding lay  
> Through darkness—in such altered guise the fiend  
> Flits shrieking, and still flits in Turnus' face,  
> Flapping his shield with pinion-strokes. A strange  
> And fearful numbness loosed his limbs; his hair  
> Stood stiff with horror, the voice stuck in his throat.
> 
> But when from far the Fury's whistling wings  
> She knew, Juturna, hapless one, rent loose  
> Her tresses, and marred, sister-like, her face  
> With wounding nails, and with clenched hands her breast.
> 
> "How shall thy sister stead thee, Turnus, now?  
> What more avails my hardihood? Wherewith  
> May I prolong thy life-day, or how face  
> A pest so dire? Now, now I quit the field:  
> Fright not the trembler more, ye birds of bale;  
> I know your wing-beat and its deathful whirr;  
> The haughty mandates of imperious Jove  
> I miss not. Quits he thus my maiden loss?  
> Why dowered he me with life eternal? Why  
> Of mortal's lot bereaved me? I might else  
> Surely have ended all these miseries,  
> Trod the dark road at my poor brother's side.  
> Immortal I? could aught of all I have?  
> Brother, be sweet without thee? Ah! might Earth  
> Somewhere yawn deep enough to serve my need,  
> And hurl me—goddess—to the ghosts below!"
> 
> She ceased, her head in grey-green mantle wrapped,  
> Sore sighing, and plunged beneath her sacred pool.
> 
> Aeneas pressed onward, brandishing his spear,  
> Huge, like a tree-trunk, and with wrathful heart  
> Made utterance: "What delays thee next? why still  
> So backward, Turnus? Not with speed of foot  
> Strive we, but in grim arms, and hand to hand.  
> Shift to all shapes, yea, muster all thou canst  
> Of craft or valour; pray now to wing aloft  
> The star-way, or in earth's pent hollows hide."
> 
> He shook his head: "Thy fiery words, fierce man,  
> Affright me not; the gods and adverse Jove  
> Affright me." There he ceased, and, glancing round,  
> Spied a vast stone, an ancient stone and vast,  
> Which chanced to lie there, for a landmark pitched,  
> Twixt rival fields to sever, on the plain.  
> Scarce could twice six, of such as earth in bulk  
> Now bears, upon their necks have heaved it; he  
> Caught with quick hand and hurled it on the foe,  
> High-towering, and at hero's utmost speed.  
> Yet knew he not himself, as on he rushed,  
> Or reared aloft and swung the mighty stone;  
> But his knees totter, his blood curdles cold:  
> Nor the stone's self, which through the void he whirled,  
> Sped to full distance, or brought home the blow.
> 
> Even as in dreams of night, when languorous sleep  
> Weighs down the eyelids, with vain wish we seem  
> Some eager course to ply, but helpless sink  
> Even in mid effort; and the tongue lacks power,  
> And the limbs' wonted strength besteads us not.  
> Nor voice nor utterance follows: even so,  
> Strain as his valour might, the goddess fell  
> Bars Turnus from fulfilment. Through his heart  
> Shift changeful phantasies; on Rutule host  
> And on the town he gazes, and with dread  
> Falters, and quails before the impending lance;  
> Nor whither 'scape, with what force meet the foe.  
> Nor car he sees, nor sister-charioteer.
> 
> Even as he faltered his death-bearing dart  
> Aeneas brandished, marking with his eye  
> The happy moment, then with all his bulk  
> Hurled it against him. Never stone so crashed,  
> Flung from the leaguer's engine, nor such roar  
> Burst with the fire-bolt. Like a black typhoon,  
> Laden with dire destruction, sped the spear,  
> And rending ope the warrior's corslet rims  
> And utmost circle of his sevenfold shield,  
> Right through the thigh rushed hurtling. At the blow  
> Turnus fell huge to earth on bended knee.
> 
> Upsurge the Rutules with one groan, and all  
> The mountain round rebellows, and far off  
> The forest-depths reverberate the cry.  
> Lowly, with up-cast eyes, a suppliant hand  
> Outstretching, "I have earned it," he exclaims,  
> "Nor deprecate my doom; thy fortune use.  
> If a sad father's yearning heart at all  
> Can touch thee, I implore—thou too hadst such  
> A sire, Anchises—upon Daunus old  
> Have pity, and me, or, if thou wilt, my corse,  
> Reft of the daylight, to mine own restore.  
> Thou art the victor; and Ausonia's folk  
> Have seen me stretch forth vanquished hands; 'tis thine  
> To wed Lavinia; further hate forgo."
> 
> Fierce in his arms, with rolling eyeballs, stood  
> Aeneas, and checked his hand; and more and more  
> The words 'gan work upon his faltering will.  
> When high on shoulder lo! the luckless belt  
> Lay bare, and with its well-known bosses gleamed  
> The girdle of young Pallas, whom erewhile  
> Turnus with wound had vanquished, and laid low,  
> And now on shoulder bore the fatal badge.  
> Soon as those relics—record of fierce grief—  
> His eyes drank in, with sudden frenzy fired,  
> And terrible in his wrath: "Wouldst thou go hence—  
> Tricked in my comrade's trophies 'scape my hand?  
> Thou art Pallas' victim; Pallas deals this blow,  
> And claims the forfeit of thy felon blood."
> 
> So saying, with fiery force he plunged the steel  
> Full in his bosom. Then the warrior's limbs  
> Grow chilled and slackened, and the spirit flies  
> Moaning indignant to the shades below.
