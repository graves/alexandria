# Volume 06 - Herodotus, Thucydides

The foundational works of Western historiography, presenting two distinct approaches to recording and interpreting historical events.

## HERODOTUS (c. 484-425 B.C.)

Known as the "Father of History," Herodotus was the first writer to systematically collect materials, test their accuracy, and arrange them in a narrative.

- **The History** - An account of the Greco-Persian Wars and the customs, geography, and history of the peoples of the ancient world. Herodotus weaves together military history, ethnography, and storytelling to explore the clash between Greek and Persian civilizations.

## THUCYDIDES (c. 460-400 B.C.)

The father of "scientific history" and political realism, Thucydides applied strict standards of evidence and analysis to historical writing.

- **History of the Peloponnesian War** - A rigorous account of the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta (431-404 B.C.). Distinguished by its objectivity, analysis of power politics, and exploration of how war corrupts individuals and societies.
