## Treatise on the Resurrection

### I. Before the Resurrection

#### QUESTION LXIX
Of matters concerning the Resurrection, and first, of the place where souls are after death  
(In Seven Articles)

In sequence to the foregoing we must treat of matters concerning the state of resurrection. For after speaking of the sacraments whereby man is delivered from the death of sin, we must next speak of the resurrection whereby man is delivered from the death of punishment. The treatise on the resurrection offers a threefold consideration, namely the things that precede, those that accompany, and those that follow the resurrection. Consequently we must speak (1) of those things which partly, though not wholly, precede the resurrection; (2) of the resurrection itself and its circumstances (q. LXXV); (3) of the things which follow it (q. LXXXVII).

Among the things which precede the resurrection we must consider (1) the places appointed for the reception of bodies after death; (2) the quality of separated souls, and the punishment inflicted on them by fire (q. LXX); (3) the intercessory prayers (*suffragia*) whereby the souls of the departed are assisted by the living (q. LXXI); (4) the prayers of the saints in heaven (q. LXXII); (5) the signs preceding the general judgment (q. LXXIII); (6) the fire of the world’s final conflagration which will precede the appearance of the Judge (q. LXXIV).

Under the first head there are seven points of inquiry: (1) Whether any places are appointed to receive souls after death? (2) Whether souls are conveyed there immediately after death? (3) Whether they are able to leave those places? (4) Whether the limbo of hell is the same as Abraham’s bosom? (5) Whether limbo is the same as the hell of the damned? (6) Whether the limbo of the patriarchs is the same as the limbo of children? (7) Whether so many places should be distinguished?

### Article I. Whether places are appointed to receive souls after death?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that places are not appointed to receive souls after death.

Objection 1. For as Boethius says (*De Hebdomadibus*) “wise men are agreed that incorporeal things are not in a place,” and this agrees with the words of Augustine (*De Genesi ad Litteram* xii, 32): “We can answer without hesitation that the soul is not conveyed to corporeal places, except with a body, or that it is not conveyed locally.” Now the soul separated from the body is without a body, as Augustine also says. Therefore it is absurd to assign any places for the reception of souls.

Obj. 2. Further, whatever has a definite place has more in common with that place than with any other. Now separated souls, like certain other spiritual substances, are indifferent to all places; for it cannot be said that they agree with certain bodies and differ from others, since they are utterly removed from all corporeal conditions. Therefore places should not be assigned for their reception.

Obj. 3. Further, nothing is assigned to separated souls after death except what conduces to their punishment or to their reward. But a corporeal place cannot conduce to their punishment or reward, since they receive nothing from bodies. Therefore definite places should not be assigned to receive them.

On the contrary, the empyrean heaven is a corporeal place, and yet “as soon as it was made it was filled with the holy angels,” as Bede says. Since then angels, even as separated souls, are incorporeal, it would seem that some place should also be assigned to receive separated souls.

Further, this appears from Gregory’s statement (*Dialogues*, iv) that souls after death are conveyed to various corporeal places, as in the case of Paschasius whom Germanus, Bishop of Capua, found at the baths, and of the soul of King Theodoric, which he asserts to have been conveyed to hell. Therefore after death souls have certain places for their reception.

I answer that, although spiritual substances do not depend on a body in respect of their being, nevertheless the corporeal world is governed by God by means of the spiritual world, as asserted by Augustine (*De Trinitate* iii, 4) and Gregory (*Dialogues*, iv, 6). Hence it is that there is a certain fittingness by way of congruity of spiritual substances to corporeal substances, in that the more noble bodies are adapted to the more noble substances; hence also the philosophers held that the order of separate substances is according to the order of movables. And though after death souls have no bodies assigned to them of which they are the forms or determinate movers, nevertheless certain corporeal places are appointed to them by way of congruity in reference to their degree of nobility (wherein they are as though in a place, after the manner in which incorporeal things can be in a place), according as they more or less approach to the first substance (to which the highest place is fittingly assigned), namely God, whose throne the Scriptures proclaim heaven to be (Isa. 66.1; Acts 7.49). Therefore we hold that those souls that have a perfect share of the Godhead are in heaven, and that those souls that are deprived of that share are assigned to a contrary place.

Reply Obj. 1. Incorporeal things are not in place after a manner known and familiar to us, in which way we say that bodies are properly in place, but they are in place after a manner befitting spiritual substances, a manner that cannot be fully manifest to us.

Reply Obj. 2. Things have something in common with or a likeness to one another in two ways. First, by sharing the same quality; thus hot things have something in common. And incorporeal things can have nothing in common with corporeal things in this way. Secondly, by a kind of proportionality, by reason of which the Scriptures apply the corporeal world to the spiritual metaphorically. Thus the Scriptures speak of God as the sun (Wisd. 5.6; Isa. 60.19) because He is the principle of spiritual life just as the sun is of corporeal life. In this way certain souls have more in common with certain places; for instance, souls that are spiritually enlightened, with luminous bodies, and souls that are plunged in darkness by sin, with dark places.

Reply Obj. 3. The separated soul receives nothing directly from corporeal places in the same way as bodies which are maintained by their respective places, yet these same souls, through knowing themselves to be appointed to such places, gather joy or sorrow from this; and thus their place conduces to their punishment or reward.

### Article II. Whether souls are conveyed to heaven or hell immediately after death?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that no souls are conveyed to heaven or hell immediately after death.

Objection 1. For a gloss on Ps. 36.10, “Yet a little while and the wicked shall not be,” says that “the saints are delivered at the end of life; yet after this life they will not yet be where the saints will be when it is said to them: ‘Come ye blessed of My Father.’” Now those saints will be in heaven. Therefore after this life the saints do not go immediately up to heaven.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says (*Enchiridion*, ch. 109) that “the time which lies between man’s death and the final resurrection holds the souls in secret receptacles according as each one is worthy of rest or of suffering.” Now these secret abodes cannot denote heaven and hell, since also after the final resurrection the souls will be there together with their bodies, so that he would have no reason to distinguish between the time before and the time after the resurrection. Therefore they will be neither in hell nor in heaven until the day of judgment.

Obj. 3. Further, the glory of the soul is greater than that of bodies. Now the glory of the body is awarded to all at the same time, so that each one may have the greater joy in the common rejoicing of all, as appears from a gloss on Heb. 11.40, “God providing some better thing for us”—“that the common joy may make each one rejoice the more.” Much more, therefore, ought the glory of souls to be deferred until the end, so as to be awarded to all at the same time.

Obj. 4. Further, punishment and reward, being pronounced by the sentence of the judge, should not precede the judgment. Now hell fire and the joys of heaven will be awarded to all by the sentence of Christ judging them, namely at the last judgment, according to Matt. 25. Therefore no one will go up to heaven or down to hell before the day of judgment.

On the contrary, it is written (2 Cor. 5.1):

> If our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have . . . a house not made with hands, but reserved in heaven (Vulg., eternal in heaven. Cf. 1 Pet. 1.4).

Therefore, after the body’s dissolution, the soul has an abode, which had been reserved for it in heaven.

Further, the Apostle says (Phil. 1.23):

> I have a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.

From these words Gregory argues as follows (*Dialogues*, iv, 25): “If there is no doubt that Christ is in heaven, it cannot be denied that Paul’s soul is in heaven likewise.” Now it cannot be denied that Christ is in heaven, since this is an article of faith. Therefore neither is it to be doubted that the souls of the saints are borne to heaven. That also some souls go down to hell immediately after death is evident from Luke 16.22, “And the rich man died, and he was buried in hell.”

I answer that, even as in bodies there is heaviness or lightness whereby they are borne to their own place which is the end of their movement, so in the souls there is merit or demerit whereby they reach their reward or punishment, which are the ends of their deeds. Therefore just as a body is conveyed at once to its place, by its heaviness or lightness, unless there is an obstacle, so too the soul, the bonds of the flesh being broken, by which it was detained in the state of the wayfarer, receives at once its reward or punishment, unless there is an obstacle. Thus sometimes venial sin, though needing first of all to be cleansed, is an obstacle to the receiving of the reward, the result being that the reward is delayed. And since a place is assigned to souls in keeping with their reward or punishment, as soon as the soul is set free from the body it is either plunged into hell or soars to heaven, unless it be held back by some debt, for which its flight must be delayed until the soul is first of all cleansed. This truth is attested by the manifest authority of the canonical Scriptures and the doctrine of the holy Fathers; therefore the contrary must be judged heretical as stated in *Dialogues*, iv and in *De Ecclesiastica Dogmate*.

Reply Obj. 1. The gloss explains itself, for it expounds the words, “They will not yet be where the saints will be,” etc., by saying immediately afterwards: “That is to say, they will not have the double stole which the saints will have at the resurrection.”

Reply Obj. 2. Among the secret abodes of which Augustine speaks, we must also put hell and heaven, where some souls are detained before the resurrection. The reason why a distinction is drawn between the time before and the time after the resurrection is because before the resurrection they are there without the body while afterwards they are with the body, and because in certain places there are souls now which will not be there after the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 3. There is a kind of continuity among men as regards the body, because in this respect is verified the saying of Acts 17.24, 26, “God . . . hath made of one all mankind.” But He has fashioned souls independently of one another. Consequently it is not so fitting that all men should be glorified together in the soul as that they should be glorified together in the body.

Moreover the glory of the body is not so essential as the glory of the soul. Therefore it would be more derogatory to the saints if the glory of the soul were delayed than that the glory of the body be deferred; nor could this detriment to their glory be compensated on account of the joy of each one being increased by the common joy.

Reply Obj. 4. Gregory proposes and solves this very difficulty (*Dialogues*, iv, 25): “If then,” he says, “the souls of the just are in heaven now, what will they receive in reward for their justice on the judgment day?” And he answers: “Surely it will be a gain to them at the judgment, that whereas now they enjoy only the happiness of the soul, afterwards they will enjoy also that of the body, so as to rejoice also in the flesh wherein they bore sorrow and torments for the Lord.” The same is to be said in reference to the damned.

### Article III. Whether the souls who are in heaven or hell are able to leave those places?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the souls in heaven or hell are unable to leave those places.

Objection 1. For Augustine says (*De Cura Pro Mortuis*, xiii): “If the souls of the dead took any part in the affairs of the living, to say nothing of others, there is myself whom not for a single night would my loving mother fail to visit since she followed me by land and sea in order to abide with me”; and from this he concludes that the souls of the departed do not mingle in the affairs of the living. But they would be able to do so if they were to leave their abode. Therefore they do not go forth from their abode.

Obj. 2. Further, it is written (Ps. 26.4): “That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,” and (Job 7.9): “He that shall go down to hell shall not come up.” Therefore neither the good nor the wicked quit their abode.

Obj. 3. Further, as stated above (a. 2), dwelling places are awarded to souls after death as a reward or punishment. Now after death neither the rewards of the saints nor the punishments of the damned are increased. Therefore they do not leave their abodes.

On the contrary, Jerome writing against Vigilantius addresses him thus: “For thou sayest that the souls of the apostles and martyrs have taken up their abode either in Abraham’s bosom or in the place of refreshment, or under the altar of God, and that they are unable to visit their graves when they will. Wouldst thou then lay down the law for God? Wouldst thou put the apostles in chains, imprison them until the day of judgment, and forbid them to be with their Lord, them of whom it is written: ‘These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth’? And if the Lamb is everywhere, therefore we must believe that those also who are with Him are everywhere.” Therefore it is absurd to say that the souls of the departed do not leave their abode.

Further, Jerome argues as follows: “Since the devil and the demons wander throughout the whole world, and are everywhere present with wondrous speed, why should the martyrs, after shedding their blood, be imprisoned and unable to go forth?” Hence we may infer that not only the good sometimes leave their abode, but also the wicked, since their damnation does not exceed that of the demons who wander about everywhere.

Further, the same conclusion may be gathered from Gregory (*Dialogues*, iv), where he relates many cases of the dead having appeared to the living.

I answer that, there are two ways of understanding a person to leave hell or heaven. First, that he goes out of those places absolutely, so that heaven or hell be no longer his place, and in this way no one who is finally consigned to hell or heaven can go out of them, as we shall state further on (q. LXXI, a. 5, Reply 5). Secondly, they may be understood to go forth for a time, and here we must distinguish what befits them according to the order of nature and what according to the order of Divine providence, for as Augustine says (*De Cura Pro Mortuis*, xvi): “Human affairs have their limits other than have the winders of the Divine power; nature’s works differ from those which are done miraculously.”

Consequently, according to the natural course, the separated souls consigned to their respective abodes are utterly cut off from communion with the living. For according to the course of nature men living in mortal bodies are not immediately united to separate substances, since their entire knowledge arises from the senses; nor would it be fitting for them to leave their abode for any purpose other than to take part in the affairs of the living.

Nevertheless, according to the disposition of Divine providence separated souls sometimes come forth from their abode and appear to men, as Augustine, in the book quoted above, relates of the martyr Felix who appeared visibly to the people of Nola when they were besieged by the barbarians. It is also credible that this may occur sometimes to the damned, and that for man’s instruction and intimidation they be permitted to appear to the living; or again in order to seek our prayers, as to those who are detained in purgatory, as evidenced by many instances related in the fourth book of the *Dialogues*. There is, however, this difference between the saints and the damned, that the saints can appear when they will to the living, but not the damned; for even as the saints while living in the flesh are able by the gifts of gratuitous grace to heal and work wonders, which can only be done miraculously by the Divine power, and cannot be done by those who lack this gift, so it is not unfitting for the souls of the saints to be endowed with a power in virtue of their glory so that they are able to appear wondrously to the living when they will, while others are unable to do so unless they be sometimes permitted.

Reply Obj. 1. Augustine, as may be gathered from what he says afterwards, is speaking according to the common course of nature. And yet it does not follow that even if the dead be able to appear to the living as they will, that they appear as often as when living in the flesh, because when they are separated from the flesh, they are either wholly conformed to the divine will, so that they may do nothing but what they see to be agreeable with the Divine disposition, or else they are so overwhelmed by their punishments that their grief for their unhappiness surpasses their desire to appear to others.

Reply Obj. 2. The authorities quoted speak in the sense that no one comes forth from heaven or hell absolutely, and do not imply that one may not come forth for a time.

Reply Obj. 3. As stated above (a. 1, Reply 3) the soul’s place conduces to its punishment or reward in so far as the soul, through being consigned to that place, is affected either by joy or by grief. Now this joy or grief at being consigned to such a place remains in the soul even when it is outside that place. Thus a bishop who is given the honour of sitting on a throne in the church incurs no dishonour when he leaves the throne, for though he sits not there actually, the place remains assigned to him.

We must also reply to the arguments in the contrary sense.

Reply Obj. 4. Jerome is speaking of the apostles and martyrs in reference to that which they gain from their power of glory, and not to that which befits them as due to them by nature. And when he says that they are everywhere, he does not mean that they are in several places or everywhere at once, but that they can be wherever they will.

Reply Obj. 5. There is no equivalence between demons and angels on the one hand and the souls of the saints and of the damned on the other. For the good or bad angels have allotted to them the office of presiding over men, to watch over them or to try them; but this cannot be said of the souls of men. Nevertheless, according to the power of glory, it is fitting to the souls of the saints that they can be where they will, and this is what Jerome means to say.

Reply Obj. 6. Although the souls of the saints or of the damned are sometimes actually present where they appear, we are not to believe that this is always so, for sometimes these apparitions occur to persons whether asleep or awake by the activity of good or wicked angels in order to instruct or deceive the living. Thus sometimes even the living appear to others and tell them many things in their sleep, and yet it is clear that they are not present, as Augustine proves from many instances (*De Cura Pro Mortuis*, xi, xii).

### Article IV. Whether the limbo of hell is the same as Abraham’s bosom?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the limbo of hell is not the same as Abraham’s bosom.

Objection 1. For according to Augustine (*De Genesi ad Litteram* xxxiii, 33): “I have not yet found Scripture mentioning hell in a good sense.” Now Abraham’s bosom is taken in a favourable sense, as Augustine goes on to say: “Surely no one would be allowed to give an unfavourable signification to Abraham’s bosom and the place of rest whither the godly poor man was carried by the angels.” Therefore Abraham’s bosom is not the same as the limbo of hell.

Obj. 2. Further, those who are in hell do not see God. Yet God is seen by those who are in Abraham’s bosom, as may be gathered from Augustine who, speaking of Nebridius, says: “Whatever that be, which is signified by that bosom, there lives my Nebridius,” and further on: “Now lays he not his ear to my mouth, but his spiritual mouth unto Thy fountain, and drinketh as much as he can receive wisdom in proportion to his thirst, endlessly happy.” Therefore Abraham’s bosom is not the same as the limbo of hell.

Obj. 3. Further, the Church does not pray that a man be taken to hell, and yet she prays that the angels may carry the departed soul to Abraham’s bosom. Therefore it would seem that Abraham’s bosom is not the same as limbo.

On the contrary, the place where the beggar Lazarus was taken is called Abraham’s bosom (Luke 16.22). Now he was taken to hell, for as a gloss on Job 30.23, “Where a house is appointed for every one that liveth,” says, “hell was the house of all the living until the coming of Christ.” Therefore Abraham’s bosom is the same as limbo.

Further, Jacob said to his sons (Gen. 44.38): “You will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell,” and therefore Jacob knew that he would be taken to hell after his death. Therefore Abraham likewise was taken to hell after his death, and consequently Abraham’s bosom would seem to be a part of hell.

I answer that, after death men’s souls cannot find rest save by the merit of faith, because he that cometh to God must believe (Heb. 11.6). Now the first example of faith was given to men in the person of Abraham, who was the first to sever himself from the body of unbelievers, and to receive a special sign of faith, for which reason the place of rest given to men after death is called Abraham’s bosom, as Augustine declares (*De Genesi ad Litteram* xii, 34).

But the souls of the saints have not at all times had the same rest after death, because since Christ’s coming they have had complete rest through enjoying the vision of God, whereas before Christ’s coming they had rest through being exempt from punishment, but their desire was not set at rest by their attaining their end. Consequently the state of the saints before Christ’s coming may be considered both as regards the rest it afforded, and thus it is called Abraham’s bosom, and as regards its lack of rest, and thus it is called the limbo of hell.

Accordingly, before Christ’s coming the limbo of hell and Abraham’s bosom were one place accidentally and not essentially; and consequently, nothing prevents Abraham’s bosom from being after Christ’s coming, and from being altogether distinct from limbo, since things that are one accidentally may be parted from one another.

Reply Obj. 1. The state of the holy Fathers as regards what was good in it was called Abraham’s bosom, but as regards its deficiencies it was called hell. Accordingly, neither is Abraham’s bosom taken in an unfavourable sense, nor hell in a favourable sense, although in a way they are one.

Reply Obj. 2. The place of rest of the holy Fathers was called Abraham’s bosom before as well as after Christ’s coming, but in different ways. For since before Christ’s coming the saints’ rest had a lack of rest attached to it, it was called both hell and Abraham’s bosom, in so far as God was not seen there. But since after the coming of Christ the saints’ rest is complete through their seeing God, this rest is called Abraham’s bosom, but not hell in any way. It is to this bosom of Abraham that the Church prays for the faithful to be brought.

Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident, and the same meaning applies to a gloss on Luke 16.22, “It came to pass that the beggar died, etc.,” which says: “Abraham’s bosom is the rest of the blessed poor, whose is the kingdom of heaven.”

### Article V. Whether limbo is the same as the hell of the damned?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that the limbo of hell is the same as the hell of the damned.

Objection 1. For Christ is said to have “bitten” hell (Hos. 13.14), but not to have swallowed it, because He took some but not all from there. Now He would not be said to have bitten hell if those whom He set free were not part of the multitude shut up in hell. Therefore since those whom He set free were shut up in hell, the same were shut up in limbo and in hell. Therefore limbo is either the same as hell, or is a part of hell.

Obj. 2. Further, in the Creed Christ is said to have descended into hell. But He did not descend save to the limbo of the Fathers. Therefore the limbo of the Fathers is the same as hell.

Obj. 3. Further, it is written (Job 17.16):

All that I have shall go down into the deepest hell (Douay, — pit). Now since Job was a holy and just man, he went down to limbo. Therefore limbo is the same as the deepest hell.

On the contrary, “In hell there is no redemption.”5 But the saints were redeemed from limbo. Therefore limbo is not the same as hell.

Further, Augustine says (*Gen. ad Lit.* xii, 33):6 “I do not see how we can believe that the rest which Lazarus received was in hell.” Now the soul of Lazarus went down into limbo. Therefore limbo is not the same as hell.

I answer that, The abodes of souls after death may be distinguished in two ways: either as to their situation, or as to the quality of the places, according, that is, as souls are punished or rewarded in certain places. If therefore we consider the limbo of the Fathers and hell in respect of the aforesaid quality of the places, there is no doubt that they are distinct, both because in hell there is sensible punishment, which was not in the limbo of the Fathers, and because in hell there is eternal punishment, whereas the saints were detained but temporally in the limbo of the Fathers.

On the other hand, if we consider them as to the situation of the place, it is probable that hell and limbo are the same place, or that they are continuous as it were, yet so that some higher part of hell be called the limbo of the Fathers. For those who are in hell receive various punishments according to the diversity of their guilt, so that those who are condemned are consigned to darker and deeper parts of hell according as they have been guilty of graver sins, and consequently the holy Fathers in whom there was the least amount of sin were consigned to a higher and less darksome part than all those who were condemned to punishment.

Reply Obj. 1. When Christ, by His descent, delivered the Fathers from limbo, He is said to have harried hell and to have descended into hell in so far as hell and limbo are the same as to situation.

This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.

Reply Obj. 3. Job descended, not to the hell of the damned, but to the limbo of the Fathers, the latter is called the deepest place not in reference to the places of punishment, but in comparison with other places, as including all penal places under one head. — Again we may reply with Augustine (*Gen. ad Lit.* xii, 33)1 who says of Jacob: “When Jacob said to his sons, ‘You will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell,’ he seems to have feared most, lest he should be troubled with so great a sorrow as to obtain, not the rest of good men, but the hell of sinners.” The saying of Job may be expounded in the same way, as being the utterance of one in fear, rather than an assertion.

### Article 6. Whether the Limbo of Children Is the Same as the Limbo of the Fathers?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that the limbo of children is the same as the limbo of the Fathers.

Objection 1. For punishment should correspond to sin. Now the Fathers were detained in limbo for the same sin as children, namely for original sin. Therefore the place of punishment should be the same for both.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says (*Enchir.* xciii):2 “The punishment of children who die in none but original sin is most lenient.” But no punishment is more lenient than that of the holy Fathers. Therefore the place of punishment is the same for both.

On the contrary, Even as temporal punishment in purgatory and eternal punishment in hell are due to actual sin, so temporal punishment in the limbo of the Fathers and eternal punishment in the limbo of the children were due to original sin. If, therefore, hell and purgatory are not the same it would seem that neither are the limbo of children and the limbo of the Fathers the same.

I answer that, The limbo of the Fathers and the limbo of children, without any doubt, differ as to the quality of punishment or reward. For children have no hope of the blessed life, as the Fathers in limbo had, in whom, moreover, shone forth the light of faith and grace. But as regards their situation, there is reason to believe that the place of both is the same, except that the limbo of the Fathers is placed higher than the limbo of children, just as we have stated in reference to limbo and hell (a. 5).

Reply Obj. 1. The Fathers did not stand in the same relation to original sin as children. For in the Fathers original sin was expiated in so far as it infected the person, while there remained an obstacle on the part of nature, on account of which their satisfaction was not yet complete. On the other hand, in children there is an obstacle both on the part of the person and on the part of nature, and for this reason different abodes are appointed to the Fathers and to children.

Reply Obj. 2. Augustine is speaking of punishments due to someone by reason of his person. Of these the most lenient are due to those who are burdened with none but original sin. But lighter still is the punishment due to those who are debarred from the reception of glory by no personal defect but only by a defect of nature, so that this very delay of glory is called a kind of punishment.

### Article 7. Whether So Many Abodes Should Be Distinguished?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that we should not distinguish so many abodes.

Objection 1. For after death, just as abodes are due to souls on account of sin, so are they due on account of merit. Now there is only one abode due on account of merit, namely paradise. Therefore neither should there be more than one abode due on account of sin, namely hell.

Obj. 2. Further, Abodes are appointed to souls after death on account of merits or demerits. Now there is one place where they merit or demerit. Therefore only one abode should be assigned to them after death.

Obj. 3. Further, The places of punishment should correspond to the sins. Now there are only three kinds of sin, namely original, venial, and mortal. Therefore there should only be three penal abodes.

Obj. 4. On the other hand, it would seem that there should be many more than those assigned. For this darksome air is the prison house of the demons (2 Pet. 2:17), and yet it is not reckoned among the five abodes which are mentioned by certain authors. Therefore there are more than five abodes.

Obj. 5. Further, The earthly paradise is distinct from the heavenly paradise. Now some were borne away to the earthly paradise after this state of life, as is related of Enoch (Ecclus. 44:16) and Elias (4 Kings 2:11). Since then the earthly paradise is not counted among the five abodes, it would seem that there are more than five.

Obj. 6. Further, Some penal place should correspond to each state of sinners. Now if we suppose a person to die in original sin who has committed only venial sins, none of the assigned abodes will be befitting to him. For it is clear that he would not be in heaven, since he would be without grace, and for the same reason neither would he be in the limbo of the Fathers; nor again, would he be in the limbo of children, since there is no sensible punishment there, which is due to such a person by reason of venial sin; nor would he be in purgatory, where there is none but temporal punishment, whereas everlasting punishment is due to him; nor would he be in the hell of the damned, since he is not guilty of actual mortal sin. Therefore a sixth abode should be assigned.

Obj. 7. Further, Rewards and punishments vary in quantity according to the differences of sins and merits. Now the degrees of merit and sin are infinite. Therefore we should distinguish an infinite number of abodes, in which souls are punished or rewarded after death.

Obj. 8. Further, Souls are sometimes punished in the places where they sinned, as Gregory states (*Dial.* iv, 55).1 But they sinned in the place which we inhabit. Therefore this place should be reckoned among the abodes, especially since some are punished for their sins in this world, as the Master said above (*iv Sent.* d. 15).2

Obj. 9. Further, Just as some die in a state of grace and have some venial sins for which they deserve punishment, so some die in mortal sin and have some good for which they would deserve a reward. Now to those who die in grace with venial sins an abode is assigned where they are punished before they receive their reward, which abode is purgatory. Therefore, on the other hand, there should be equally an abode for those who die in mortal sin together with some good works.

Obj. 10. Further, Just as the Fathers were delayed from obtaining full glory of the soul before Christ’s coming, so are they now detained from receiving the glory of the body. Therefore as we distinguish an abode of the saints before the coming of Christ from the one where they are received now, so ought we to distinguish the one in which they are received now from the one where they will be received after the resurrection.

I answer that, The abodes of souls are distinguished according to the souls’ various states. Now the soul united to a mortal body is in the state of meriting, while the soul separated from the body is in the state of receiving good or evil for its merits, so that after death it is either in the state of receiving its final reward, or in the state of being hindered from receiving it. If it is in the state of receiving its final retribution, this happens in two ways: either in the respect of good, and then it is paradise; or in respect of evil, and thus as regards actual sin it is hell, and as regards original sin it is the limbo of children. On the other hand, if it be in the state where it is hindered from receiving its final reward, this is either on account of a defect of the person, and thus we have purgatory where souls are detained from receiving their reward at once on account of the sins they have committed, or else it is on account of a defect of nature, and thus we have the limbo of the Fathers, where the Fathers were detained from obtaining glory on account of the guilt of human nature which could not yet be expiated.

Reply Obj. 1. “Good happens in one way, but evil in many ways,” according to Dionysius (*Div. Nom.* iv)3 and the Philosopher.4 Therefore it is not unfitting if there be one place of blissful reward and several places of punishment.

Reply Obj. 2. The state of meriting and demeriting is one state, since the same person is able to merit and demerit. Therefore it is fitting that one place should be assigned to all. But of those who receive according to their merits there are various states, and consequently the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 3. One may be punished in two ways for original sin, as stated above, either in reference to the person, or in reference to nature only. Consequently there is a twofold limbo corresponding to that sin.

Reply Obj. 4. This darksome air is assigned to the demons not as the place where they receive retribution for their merits, but as a place befitting their office, in so far as they are appointed to try us. Hence it is not accounted among the abodes of which we are treating now, since hell fire is assigned to them in the first place (Matt. 25).

Reply Obj. 5. The earthly paradise belongs to the state of the wayfarer rather than to the state of those who receive for their merits, and consequently it is not put among the abodes of which we are treating now.

Reply Obj. 6. This supposition is impossible. If, however, it were possible, such a one would be punished in hell eternally, for that venial sin is punished temporally in purgatory happens to it through its having grace joined to it; therefore if it is joined to a mortal sin, which is without grace, it will be punished eternally in hell. And since this one who dies in original sin has a venial sin without grace, it is not unfitting to suppose that he is punished eternally.

Reply Obj. 7. Diversity of degrees in punishments or rewards does not diversify the state, and it is according to the diversity of state that we distinguish various abodes. Hence the argument does not prove.

Reply Obj. 8. Although separated souls are sometimes punished in the place where we dwell, it does not follow that this is their proper place of punishment, but this is done for our instruction, that seeing their punishment we may be deterred from sin. That souls while yet in the flesh are punished here for their sins has nothing to do with the question, because a punishment of this kind does not place a man outside the state of meriting or demeriting, whereas we are treating now of the abodes to which souls are assigned after the state of merit or demerit.

Reply Obj. 9. It is impossible for evil to be pure and without the admixture of good, just as the supreme good is without any admixture of evil. Consequently those who are to be conveyed to Happiness, which is a supreme good, must be cleansed of all evil; therefore there must be a place where such persons are cleansed if they go from this life without being perfectly clean. But those who will be thrust into hell will not be free from all good, and consequently the comparison fails, since those who are in hell can receive the reward of their goods in so far as their past goods avail for the mitigation of their punishment.

Reply Obj. 10. The essential reward consists in the glory of the soul, but the body’s glory, since it overflows from the soul, is entirely founded as it were on the soul, and consequently lack of the soul’s glory causes a difference of state, whereas lack of the body’s glory does not. For this reason, too, the same place, namely the empyrean, is assigned to the holy souls separated from their bodies and united to glorious bodies; the same place however was not assigned to the souls of the Fathers both before and after the glorification of souls.

## QUESTION LXX

### Of the quality of the soul after leaving the body, and the punishment inflicted on it by material fire

#### (In Three Articles)

We must next consider the general quality of the soul after leaving the body, and the punishment inflicted on it by material fire. Under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul? (2) Whether the acts of these powers remain in the soul? (3) Whether the separated soul can suffer from corporeal fire?

### Article 1. Whether the Sensitive Powers Remain in the Separated Soul?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul.

Objection 1. For Augustine says (*De Spiritu et Anima* xv):1 “The soul withdraws from the body taking all with itself, sense and imagination, reason, understanding and intelligence, the concupiscible and irascible powers.” Now sense, imagination, concupiscible and irascible are sensitive powers. Therefore the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says (*De Eccl. Dogm.* xvi):2 “We believe that man alone has a substantial soul, which lives though separated from the body, and keeps alive its senses and understanding.” Therefore the soul retains its senses after being separated from the body.

Obj. 3. Further, The soul’s powers are either its essential parts as some maintain, or at least are its natural properties. Now that which is in a thing essentially cannot be separated from it, nor is a subject severed from its natural properties. Therefore it is impossible for the soul to lose any of its powers after being separated from the body.

Obj. 4. Further, A whole is not entire if one of its parts is lacking. Now the soul’s powers are called its parts. Therefore, if the soul lose any of its powers after death, it will not be entire after death, and this is unfitting.

Obj. 5. Further, The soul’s powers co-operate in merit more even than the body, since the body is a mere instrument of action, while the powers are principles of action. Now the body must of necessity be rewarded together with the soul, since it co-operated in merit. Much more, therefore, is it necessary that the powers of the soul be rewarded together with it. Therefore the separated soul does not lose them.

Obj. 6. Further, If the soul after separation from the body loses its sensitive power, that power must fall back into nothing. For it cannot be said that it falls back into some matter, since it has no matter as a part of itself. Now that which entirely falls back into nothing is not restored in numerical identity; therefore at the resurrection the soul will not have the numerically same sensitive powers. Now according to the Philosopher,1 as the soul is to the body so are the soul’s powers to the parts of the body, for instance the sight to the eye. But if it were not the same soul that returns to the body, it would not be the same man. Therefore for the same reason it would not be the numerically same eye, if the visual power were not numerically the same; and in like manner no other part would rise again the same in number, and consequently neither would the whole man be the same in number. Therefore it is impossible for the separated soul to lose its sensitive powers.

Obj. 7. Further, If the sensitive powers were to be corrupted when the body is corrupted, it would follow that they are weakened when the body is weakened. Yet this is not the case, for according to the book on the *Soul*,2 “if an old man were given the eye of a young man, he would, without doubt, see as well as a young man.” Therefore neither are the sensitive powers corrupted when the body is corrupted.

On the contrary, Augustine says (*De Eccl. Dogm.* xix):3 “Of two substances alone does man consist, soul and body; the soul with its reason, and the body with its senses.” Therefore the sensitive powers belong to the body, and consequently when the body is corrupted the sensitive powers do not remain in the soul.

Further, The Philosopher, speaking of the separation of the soul, expresses himself thus:4 “If, however, anything remain at last, we must ask what this is, because in certain beings it is not impossible. The soul, for instance, if it be of such a disposition, — not the whole soul but the intellect; for as regards the whole soul this is probably impossible.” Hence it seems that the whole soul is not separated from the body, but only the intellectual powers of the soul, and consequently not the sensitive or vegetative powers.

Further, The Philosopher, speaking of the intellect, says:5 “This alone comes to be separated, as the everlasting from the corruptible; for it is clear from this that the remaining parts are not separable as some maintain.” Therefore the sensitive powers do not remain in the separated soul.

I answer that, There are many opinions on this question. For some, holding the view that all the powers are in the soul in the same way as colour is in a body, hold that the soul separated from the body takes all its powers away with it, because, if it lacked any one of them, it would follow that the soul is changed in its natural properties, since these cannot change so long as their subject remains. But this view is false, for since a power is called so because it enables us to do or suffer something, and since to do and to be able belong to the same subject, it follows that the subject of a power is the same as that which is agent or patient. Hence the Philosopher says6 that “where we find power there we find action.” Now it is evident that certain operations, of which the soul’s powers are the principles, do not belong to the soul properly speaking but to the soul as united to the body, because they are not performed except through the medium of the body, — such as to see, to hear, and so forth. Hence it follows that such powers belong to the united soul and body as their subject, but to the soul as their quickening (*influens*) principle, just as the form is the principle of the properties of a composite being. Some operations, however, are performed by the soul without a bodily organ, — for instance to understand, to consider, to will; therefore, since these actions are proper to the soul, the powers that are the principles of them belong to the soul not only as their principle but also as their subject. Therefore, since so long as the proper subject remains its proper passions must also remain, and when it is corrupted they also must be corrupted, it follows that these powers which use no bodily organ for their actions must remain in the separated soul, while those which use a bodily organ must be corrupted when the body is corrupted; and such are all the powers belonging to the sensitive and the vegetative soul.

On this account some draw a distinction in the sensitive powers of the soul, for they say that they are of two kinds — some being acts of organs and emanating from the soul into the body are corrupted with the body; others, from which the former originate, are in the soul, because by them the soul sensitizes the body for seeing, hearing, and so on, and these primary powers remain in the separated soul. But this statement seems unreasonable, because the soul, by its essence and not through the medium of certain other powers, is the origin of those powers which are the acts of organs, even as any form, from the very fact that by its essence it informs its matter, is the origin of the properties which result naturally in the composite. For were it necessary to suppose other powers in the soul by means of which the powers that perfect the organs may flow from the essence of the soul, for the same reason it would be necessary to suppose other powers by means of which these intermediate powers flow from the essence of the soul, and so on to infinity, and if we have to stop it is better to do so at the first step.

Hence others say that the sensitive and other like powers do not remain in the separated soul except in a restricted sense, namely as rooted in it, in the same way as a result is in its principle, because there remains in the separated soul the ability to quicken once more these powers if it should be reunited to the body; nor is it necessary for this ability to be anything in addition to the essence of the soul, as stated above. This opinion appears to be the more reasonable.

Reply Obj. 1. This saying of Augustine is to be understood as meaning that the soul takes away with it some of those powers actually, namely understanding and intelligence, and some radically, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 2. The senses which the soul takes away with it are not these external senses, but the internal, those, namely, which pertain to the intellectual part, for the intellect is sometimes called sense, as Basil states in his commentary on the Proverbs,1 and again the Philosopher.2 If, however, he means the external senses we must reply as above to the first objection.

Reply Obj. 3. As stated above the sensitive powers are related to the soul not as natural passions to their subject, but as compared to their origin. Therefore the conclusion does not follow.

Reply Obj. 4. The powers of the soul are called its potential parts. Now the nature of such wholes is that the entire power of the whole is found perfectly in one of the parts, but partially in the others; thus in the soul the soul’s power is found perfectly in the intellectual part, but partially in the others. Therefore, as the powers of the intellectual part remain in the separated soul, the latter will remain entire and undiminished, although the sensitive powers do not remain actually; just as neither is the king’s power decreased by the death of a mayor who shared his authority.

Reply Obj. 5. The body co-operates in merit, as an essential part of the man who merits. The sensitive powers, however, do not co-operate thus, since they are of the genus of accidents. Hence the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 6. The powers of the sensitive soul are said to be acts of the organs, not as though they were the essential forms of those organs, except in reference to the soul whose powers they are. But they are the acts of the organs by perfecting them for their proper operations, just as heat is the act of fire by perfecting it for the purpose of heating. Therefore, just as a fire would remain numerically the same, although another heat were in it (even so the cold of water that has been heated returns not numerically the same, although the water remains the same in number), so the organs will be the same numerically, although the powers be not numerically the same.

Reply Obj. 7. The Philosopher is speaking there of these powers as being rooted in the soul. This is clear from his saying that “old age is an affection not of the soul, but of that in which the soul is,” namely the body. For in this sense the powers of the soul are neither weakened nor corrupted on account of the body.

### Article 2. Whether the Acts of the Sensitive Powers Remain in the Separated Soul?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the acts of the sensitive powers remain in the separated soul.

Objection 1. For Augustine says (*De Spiritu et Anima* xv):1 “When the soul leaves the body it derives pleasure or sorrow through being affected with these (namely the imagination, and the concupiscible and irascible powers) according to its merits.” But the imagination, the concupiscible, and the irascible are sensitive powers. Therefore the separated soul will be affected as regards the sensitive powers, and consequently will be in some act by reason of them.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says (*Gen. ad Lit.* xii, 24):2 that “the body feels not, but the soul through the body,” and further on: “The soul feels certain things, not through the body but without the body.” Now that which befits the soul without the body can be in the soul separated from the body. Therefore the soul will then be able to feel actually.

Obj. 3. Further, To see likenesses of bodies, as occurs in sleep, belongs to imaginary vision which is in the sensitive part. Now it happens that the separated soul sees likenesses of bodies in the same way as when we sleep. Thus Augustine says (*Gen. ad Lit.* xii, 32):3 “For I see

not why the soul has a likeness of its own body when, the body lying senseless, yet not quite dead, it sees some things which many have related after returning to life from this suspended animation and yet has it not when it has left the body through death having taken place.” For it is unintelligible that the soul should have a likeness of its body, except in so far as it sees that likeness; therefore he said before of those who lie senseless that “they have a certain likeness of their own body, by which they are able to be borne to corporeal places and by means of sensible likenesses to experience such things as they see.” Therefore the separated soul can exercise the acts of the sensitive powers.

### Obj. 4.
Further, The memory is a power of the sensitive part as proved in the book on *Memory and Reminiscence* [^4]. Now separated souls will actually remember the things they did in this world. Therefore it is said to the rich glutton (Luke 16:25): *Remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime*. Therefore the separated soul will exercise the act of a sensitive power.

### Obj. 5.
Further, According to the Philosopher [^5], the irascible and concupiscible are in the sensitive part. But joy and sorrow, love and hatred, fear and hope, and similar emotions which according to our faith we hold to be in separated souls, are in the irascible and concupiscible. Therefore separated souls will not be deprived of the acts of the sensitive powers.

### On the contrary,
That which is common to soul and body cannot remain in the separated soul. Now all the operations of the sensitive powers are common to the soul and body; and this is evident from the fact that no sensitive power exercises an act except through a bodily organ. Therefore the separated soul will be deprived of the acts of the sensitive powers.

Further, The Philosopher says [^6] that “when the body is corrupted, the soul neither remembers nor loves,” and the same applies to all the acts of the sensitive powers. Therefore the separated soul does not exercise the act of any sensitive power.

### I answer that,
Some distinguish two kinds of acts in the sensitive powers: external acts which the soul exercises through the body, and these do not remain in the separated soul; and internal acts which the soul performs by itself, and these will be in the separated soul. This statement would seem to have come down from the opinion of Plato, who held that the soul is united to the body as a perfect substance in no way dependent on the body, and merely as a mover is united to the thing moved [^7]. This is an evident consequence of transmigration which he held [^8]. And since according to him nothing is in motion except what is moved, and lest he should go on infinitely, he said that the first mover moves itself, and he maintained that the soul is the cause of its own movement [^9]. Accordingly there would be a twofold movement of the soul, one by which it moves itself, and another whereby the body is moved by the soul, so that this act “to see” is first of all in the soul itself as moving itself, and secondly in the bodily organ in so far as the soul moves the body.

This opinion is refuted by the Philosopher [^10] who proves that the soul does not move itself, and that it is in no way moved in respect of such operations as seeing, feeling, and the like, but that such operations are movements of the composite only. We must therefore conclude that the acts of the sensitive powers in no way remain in the separated soul, except perhaps as in their remote origin.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Some deny that this book is Augustine’s: for it is ascribed to a Cistercian who compiled it from Augustine’s works, and added things of his own. Hence we are not to take what is written there, as having authority. If, however, its authority should be maintained, it must be said that the meaning is that the separated soul is affected with imagination and other like powers, not as though such affection were the act of the aforesaid powers, but in the sense that the soul will be affected in the future life for good or ill according to the things which it committed in the body through the imagination and other like powers, so that the imagination and such powers are not supposed to elicit that affection, but to have elicited in the body the merit of that affection.

### Reply Obj. 2.
The soul is said to feel through the body not as though the act of feeling belonged to the soul by itself, but as belonging to the whole composite by reason of the soul, just as we say that heat heats. That which is added, namely that the soul feels some things without the body, such as fear and so forth, means that it feels such things without the outward movement of the body that takes place in the acts of the proper senses, since fear and like passions do not occur without any bodily movement.

It may also be replied that Augustine is speaking according to the opinion of the Platonists who maintained this as stated above [^11].

### Reply Obj. 3.
Augustine speaks there as for the most part throughout that book, as one inquiring and not deciding. For it is clear that there is no comparison between the soul of a sleeper and the separated soul, since the soul of the sleeper uses the organ of imagination wherein corporeal likenesses are impressed; which cannot be said of the separated soul. Or we may reply that likenesses of things are in the soul, both as to the sensitive and imaginative power and as to the intellectual power, with greater or lesser abstraction from matter and material conditions. Therefore Augustine’s comparison holds in this respect that just as the images of corporeal things are in the soul of the dreamer or of one who is carried out of his mind, imaginatively, so are they in the separated soul intellectually, but not that they are in the separated soul imaginatively.

### Reply Obj. 4.
As stated in the first book of *Sentences* [^12], memory has a twofold meaning. Sometimes it means a power of the sensitive part, in so far as its gaze extends over past time; and in this way the act of the memory will not be in the separated soul. And so the Philosopher says [^6] that “when this,” that is the body, “is corrupted, the soul remembers not.” In another way memory is used to designate that part of the imagination which pertains to the intellectual part, in so far namely as it abstracts from all differences of time, since it regards not only the past but also the present, and the future as Augustine says (*De Trinitate*, XIV, 11) [^13]. Taking memory in this sense the separated soul will remember [^14].

### Reply Obj. 5.
Love, joy, sorrow, and the like, have a twofold meaning. Sometimes they denote passions of the sensitive appetite, and thus they will not be in the separated soul, because in this way they are not exercised without a definite movement of the heart. In another way they denote acts of the will which is in the intellectual part, and in this way they will be in the separated soul, even as delight will be there without bodily movement, even as it is in God, namely in so far as it is a simple movement of the will. In this sense the Philosopher says [^15] that “God’s joy is one simple delight.”

## Article 3. Whether the Separated Soul Can Suffer from a Bodily Fire?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the separated soul cannot suffer from a bodily fire.

### Objection 1.
For Augustine says [^1]: “The things that affect the soul well or ill after its separation from the body are not corporeal but resemble corporeal things.” Therefore the separated soul is not punished with a bodily fire.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Augustine says [^2] that the agent is always more excellent than the patient. But it is impossible for any body to be more excellent than the separated soul. Therefore it cannot suffer from a body.

### Obj. 3.
Further, According to the Philosopher [^3] and Boethius (*De Duabus Naturis*) [^4] only those things that agree in matter are active and passive in relation to one another. But the soul and corporeal fire do not agree in matter, since there is no matter common to spiritual and corporeal things; and therefore they cannot be changed into one another, as Boethius says (*ibid.*). Therefore the separated soul does not suffer from a bodily fire.

### Obj. 4.
Further, Whatsoever is acted upon receives something from the agent. Therefore if the soul suffer from the bodily fire, it will receive something from it. Now whatsoever is received in a thing is received according to the mode of the recipient. Therefore that which is received in the soul from the fire is in it not materially but spiritually. Now the forms of things existing spiritually in the soul are its perfections. Therefore though it be granted that the soul suffer from the bodily fire, this will not conduce to its punishment, but rather to its perfection.

### Obj. 5.
Further, If it be said that the soul is punished merely by seeing the fire, as Gregory would seem to say (*Dialogues*, IV, 29) [^5], on the contrary,— If the soul sees the fire of hell, it cannot see it save by intellectual vision, since it has not the organs by which sensitive or imaginative vision is effected. But it would seem impossible for intellectual vision to be the cause of sorrow, since “there is no sorrow contrary to the pleasure of considering,” according to the Philosopher [^6]. Therefore the soul is not punished by that vision.

### Obj. 6.
Further, If it be said that the soul suffers from the corporeal fire through being held by it, even as now it is held by the body while living in the body, on the contrary,— The soul while living in the body is held by the body in so far as there results one thing from the soul and the body, as from form and matter. But the soul will not be the form of that corporeal fire. Therefore it cannot be held by the fire in the manner spoken of above.

### Obj. 7.
Further, Every bodily agent acts by contact. But a corporeal fire cannot be in contact with the soul, since contact is only between corporeal things whose bounds come together. Therefore the soul suffers not from that fire.

### Obj. 8.
Further, An organic agent does not act on a remote object except through acting on the intermediate objects; therefore it is able to act at a fixed distance in proportion to its power. But souls, or at least the demons to whom this equally applies, are sometimes outside the place of hell, since sometimes they appear to men even in this world; and yet they are not then free from punishment, for just as the glory of the saints is never interrupted, so neither is the punishment of the damned. And yet we do not find that all the intermediate things suffer from the fire of hell; nor again is it credible that any corporeal thing of an elemental nature has such a power that its action can reach to such a distance. Therefore it does not seem that the pains suffered by the souls of the damned are inflicted by a corporeal fire.

### On the contrary,
The possibility of suffering from a corporeal fire is equally consistent with separated souls and with demons. Now demons suffer from corporeal fire since they are punished by that fire into which the bodies of the damned will be cast after the resurrection, and which must be a corporeal fire. This is evident from the words of our Lord (Matthew 25:41), *Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil, etc.* Therefore separated souls also can suffer from that fire.

Further, Punishment should correspond to sin. Now in sinning the soul subjected itself to the body by perverse concupiscence. Therefore it is just that it should be punished by being made subject to a bodily thing by suffering from it.

Further, There is greater union between form and matter than between agent and patient. Now the diversity of spiritual and corporeal nature does not hinder the soul from being the form of the body. Therefore neither is it an obstacle to its suffering from a body.

### I answer that,
Given, from what we have said above [^7], that the fire of hell is not called so metaphorically, nor an imaginary fire, but a real corporeal fire, we must say that the soul will suffer punishment from a corporeal fire, since our Lord said (Matthew 25:41) that this fire was prepared for the devil and his angels, who are incorporeal even as the soul. But how it is that they can thus suffer is explained in many ways.

For some have said that the mere fact that the soul sees the fire makes the soul suffer from the fire; and so Gregory (*Dialogues*, IV, 29) [^5] says: “The soul suffers from the fire by merely seeing it.” But this does not seem sufficient, because whatever is seen, from the fact that it is seen, is a perfection of the seer; therefore it cannot conduce to his punishment, as seen. Sometimes, however, it is of a penal or saddening nature accidentally, in so far, that is, as it is apprehended as something hurtful, and consequently, besides the fact that the soul sees the fire, there must be some relation of the soul to the fire, according to which the fire is hurtful to the soul.

Hence others have said that although a corporeal fire cannot burn the soul, the soul nevertheless apprehends it as hurtful to itself, and in consequence of this apprehension is seized with fear and sorrow, in fulfillment of Psalm 13:5, *They have trembled for fear, where there was no fear*. Hence Gregory says [^3] that “the soul burns through seeing itself aflame.” But this, again, seems insufficient, because in this case the soul would suffer from the fire not in reality but only in apprehension, for although a real passion of sorrow or pain may result from a false imagination, as Augustine observes (*De Genesi ad Litteram*, XII, 32) [^6], it cannot be said in relation to that passion that one really suffers from the thing, but from the likeness of the thing that is seen. Moreover, this kind of suffering would be more unlike real suffering than that which results from imaginary vision, since the latter is stated to result from real images of things, which images the soul carries about with it, whereas the former results from false conceptions which the erring soul imagines; and furthermore, it is not probable that separated souls or demons, who are endowed with keen intelligence, would think it possible for a corporeal fire to hurt them if they were in no way distressed thereby.

Hence others say that it is necessary to admit that the soul suffers even really from the corporeal fire; and so Gregory says [^5]: “We can gather from the words of the Gospel that the soul suffers from the fire not only by seeing it, but also by feeling it.” They explain the possibility of this as follows. They say that this corporeal fire can be considered in two ways. First, as a corporeal thing, and thus it has not the power to act on the soul. Secondly, as the instrument of the vengeance of Divine justice. For the order of Divine justice demands that the soul which by sinning subjected itself to corporeal things should be subjected to them also in punishment. Now an instrument acts not only in virtue of its own nature, but also in virtue of the principal agent; therefore it is not unreasonable if that fire, seeing that it acts in virtue of a spiritual agent, should act on the spirit of a man or demon, in the same way as we have explained the sanctification of the soul by the sacraments [^7].

But, again, this does not seem to suffice, since every instrument, in acting on that on which it is used instrumentally, has its own connatural action besides the action whereby it acts in virtue of the principal agent; in fact it is by fulfilling the former that it effects the latter action, even as, in Baptism, it is by laving the body that water sanctifies the soul, and the saw by cutting wood produces the shape of a house. Hence we must allow the fire to exercise on the soul an action connatural to the fire, in order that it may be the instrument of Divine justice in the punishment of sin, and for this reason we must say that a body cannot naturally act on a spirit, nor in any way be hurtful or distressful to it, except in so far as the latter is in some way united to a body; for thus we observe that *the corruptible body is a load upon the soul* (Wisdom 9:15). Now a spirit is united to a body in two ways. In one way as form to matter, so that from their union there results one thing absolutely, and the spirit that is thus united to a body both quickens the body and is somewhat burdened by the body; but it is not thus that the spirit of man or demon is united to the corporeal fire. In another way as the mover is united to the things moved, or as a thing placed is united to place, even as incorporeal things are in a place. In this way created incorporeal spirits are confined to a place, being in one place in such a way as not to be in another. Now although of its nature a corporeal thing is able to confine an incorporeal spirit to a place, it is not able of its nature to detain an incorporeal spirit in the place to which it is confined, and so to tie it to that place that it be unable to seek another, since a spirit is not by nature in a place so as to be subject to place. But it is added over and above corporeal fire as the instrument of the vengeance of Divine justice thus to detain a spirit; and thus it has a penal effect on it, by hindering it from fulfilling its own will, that is by hindering it from acting where it will and as it will.

This way is asserted by Gregory (*Ibid.*) [^5]. For in explaining how the soul can suffer from that fire by feeling it, he expresses himself as follows: “Since Truth declares the rich sinner to be condemned to fire, will any wise man deny that the souls of the wicked are imprisoned in flames?” Julian says the same [^8] as quoted by the Master (*Sentences*, IV, d. XLIV) [^9]: “If the incorporeal spirit of a living man is held by the body, why shall it not be held after death by a corporeal fire?” and Augustine says [^10] that “just as, although the soul is spiritual and the body corporeal, man is so fashioned that the soul is united to the body as giving it life, and on account of this union conceives a great love for its body, so it is chained to the fire, as receiving punishment from it, and from this union conceives a loathing.”

Accordingly we must unite all the above modes together in order to understand perfectly how the soul suffers from a corporeal fire, so as to say that the fire of its nature is able to have an incorporeal spirit united to it as a thing placed is united to a place, that as the instrument of Divine justice it is enabled to detain it enchained as it were, and in this respect this fire is really hurtful to the spirit, and thus the soul seeing the fire as something hurtful to it is tormented by the fire. Hence Gregory (*Ibid.*) [^5] mentions all these in order, as may be seen from the above quotations.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Augustine speaks there as one inquiring, and so he expresses himself otherwise when deciding as quoted above [^10]. Or we may reply that Augustine means to say that the things which are the proximate occasion of the soul's pain or sorrow are spiritual, since it would not be distressed unless it apprehended the fire as hurtful to it; and so the fire as apprehended is the proximate cause of its distress, whereas the corporeal fire which exists outside the soul is the remote cause of its distress.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Although the soul is more excellent absolutely than the fire, the fire is relatively more excellent than the soul, in so far, that is, as it is the instrument of Divine justice.

### Reply Obj. 3.
The Philosopher and Boethius are speaking of the action whereby the patient is changed into the nature of the agent. Such is not the action of the fire on the soul, and consequently the argument is not conclusive.

### Reply Obj. 4.
By acting on the soul the fire bestows nothing on it but detains it, as stated above. Hence the argument is not to the point.

### Reply Obj. 5.
In intellectual vision sorrow is not caused by the fact that something is seen, since the thing seen as such can in no way be contrary to the intellect. But in the sensible vision the thing seen, by its very action on the sight so as to be seen, there may be accidentally something corruptive of the sight, in so far as it destroys the harmony of the organ. Nevertheless, intellectual vision may cause sorrow in so far as the thing seen is apprehended as hurtful, not that it hurts through being seen, but in some other way altogether. It is thus that the soul in seeing the fire is distressed.

### Reply Obj. 6.
The comparison does not hold in every respect, but it does in some, as explained above.

### Reply Obj. 7.
Although there is no bodily contact between the soul and body, there is a certain spiritual contact between them (even as the mover of the heaven, being spiritual, touches the heaven, when it moves it, with a spiritual contact) in the same way as a painful object is said to touch, as stated in the treatise on *Generation and Corruption* [^11]. This mode of contact is sufficient for action.

### Reply Obj. 8.
The souls of the damned are never outside hell, except by Divine permission, either for the instruction or for the trial of the elect. And wherever they are outside hell they nevertheless always see its fire as prepared for their punishment. Therefore, since this vision is the immediate cause of their distress, as stated above (Reply 1), wherever they are, they suffer from hell-fire. Even so prisoners, though outside the prison, suffer somewhat from the prison, seeing themselves condemned to it. Hence just as the glory of the elect is not diminished neither as to the essential nor as to the accidental reward if they happen to be outside the empyrean (in fact this somewhat conduces to their glory), so the punishment of the damned is in no way diminished, if by God’s permission they happen to be outside hell for a time. A gloss on James 3:6, *inflameth the wheel of our nativity*, etc., is in agreement with this, for it is worded thus: “The devil, wherever he is, whether in the air or under the earth, drags with him the torments of his flames.” [^12] But the objection argues as though the corporeal fire tortured the spirit immediately in the same way as it torments bodies.

## Question LXXI: Of Works of Intercession for the Dead (In Fourteen Articles)

We must now consider works of intercession for the dead. Under this head there are fourteen points of inquiry:
1.  Whether intercessory works performed by one person can profit others?
2.  Whether the dead can be assisted by the works of the living?
3.  Whether the intercessory works of sinners profit the dead?
4.  Whether intercessory works for the dead profit those who perform them?
5.  Whether intercessory works profit those who are in hell?
6.  Whether they profit those who are in purgatory?
7.  Whether they avail the children in limbo?
8.  Whether in any way they profit those who are in heaven?
9.  Whether the prayer of the Church, the Sacrament of the altar, and almsgiving profit the departed?
10. Whether indulgences granted by the Church profit them?
11. Whether the burial service profits the departed?
12. Whether intercessory works for one dead person profit that person more than others?
13. Whether intercessory works for many avail each one as much as if they were offered for each individual?
14. Whether general works of intercession avail those for whom special ones are not offered, as much as special and general prayers of intercession together avail those for whom they are offered?

## Article 1. Whether the Works of Intercession of One Person Can Profit Others?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the works of intercession (*suffragia*) of one person cannot profit others.

### Objection 1.
For it is written (Galatians 6:8): *What things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap*. Now if one person reaped fruit from the intercessory works of another, he would reap from another’s sowing. Therefore a person receives no fruit from the intercessory works of others.

### Obj. 2.
Further, It belongs to God’s justice that each one should receive according to his merits, and so the psalm (Psalm 61:13) says: *Thou wilt render to every man according to his works*. Now it is impossible for God’s justice to fail. Therefore it is impossible for one man to be assisted by the works of another.

### Obj. 3.
Further, A work is meritorious on the same count as it is praiseworthy, namely in so far as it is voluntary. Now one man is not praised for the work of another. Therefore neither can the work of one man be meritorious and fruitful for another.

### Obj. 4.
Further, It belongs to Divine justice to repay good for good in the same way as evil for evil. But no man is punished for the evil-doings of another; indeed, according to Ezekiel 18:4, *the soul that sinneth, the same shall die*. Therefore neither does one person profit by another’s good.

### On the contrary,
It is written (Psalm 118:63): *I am a partaker with all them that fear Thee, etc.*

Further, All the faithful united together by charity are members of the one body of the Church. Now one member is assisted by another. Therefore one man can be assisted by the merits of another.

### I answer that,
Our actions can avail for two purposes. First, for acquiring a certain state;

thus by a meritorious work a man obtains the state of Happiness. Secondly, for something consequent upon a state; thus by some work a man merits an accidental reward, or a rebate of punishment. And for both these purposes our actions may avail in two ways: first, by way of merit, secondly, by way of prayer, the difference being that merit relies on justice, and prayer on mercy, since he who prays obtains his petition from the mere liberality of the one he prays.

Accordingly we must say that the work of one person in no way can avail another for acquiring a state by way of merit, so that, namely, a man is able to merit eternal life by the works which I do, because the share of glory is awarded according to the measure of the recipient, and each one is disposed by his own and not by another’s actions,—disposed, that is to say, by being worthy of reward. By way of prayer, however, the work of one may profit another while he is a wayfarer, even for acquiring a state; for instance, one man may obtain the first grace for another, and since the answer to prayer depends on the liberality of God, to Whom we pray, it may extend to whatever is subject to the order of the Divine power.

On the other hand, as regards that which is consequent upon or accessory to a state, the work of one may avail another, not only by way of prayer but even by way of merit, and this happens in two ways. First, on account of their communion in the root of the work, which root is charity in meritorious works. Therefore all who are united together by charity acquire some benefit from one another’s works, although according to the measure of each one’s state, since even in heaven each one will rejoice in the goods of others. Hence it is that the communion of saints is laid down as an article of faith.[1] Secondly, through the intention of the doer who does certain works specially for the purpose that they may profit such persons, so that those works become somewhat the works of those for whom they are done, as though they were bestowed on them by the doer. And so they can avail them either for the fulfillment of satisfaction or for some similar purpose that does not change their state.

[1] Cf. The Apostles' Creed (DZ 6).

Reply Obj. 1. This reaping is the receiving of eternal life, as stated in John 4. 36, *And he that reapeth . . . gathereth fruit unto life everlasting.* Now a share of eternal life is not given to a man save for his own works, for although we may petition for another that he obtain life, this never happens except by means of his own works, when namely, at the prayers of one, another is given the grace whereby he merits eternal life.

Reply Obj. 2. The work that is done for another becomes his for whom it is done, and in like manner the work done by a man who is one with me is somewhat mine. Hence it is not contrary to Divine justice if a man receives the fruit of the works done by a man who is one with him in charity, or of works done for him. This also happens according to human justice, so that the satisfaction offered by one is accepted in lieu of another’s.

Reply Obj. 3. Praise is not given to a person save according to his relation to an act, and therefore praise is “in relation to something.”[1] And since no man is made or shown to be well or ill disposed to something by another’s deed, it follows that no man is praised for another’s deeds save accidentally, in so far as he is somewhat the cause of those deeds, by giving counsel, assistance, inducement, or by any other means. On the other hand, a work is meritorious to a person not only by reason of his disposition, but also in view of something consequent upon his disposition or state, as appears from what has been said.

[1] *Ethics*, I, 12 (1101b12).

Reply Obj. 4. It is directly contrary to justice to take away from a person that which is his due, but to give a person what is not his due is not contrary to justice, but surpasses the bounds of justice, for it is liberality. Now a person cannot be hurt by the ills of another, unless he be deprived of something of his own. Consequently it is not becoming that one should be punished for another’s sins, as it is that one should acquire some advantage from the good deeds of another.

## Article 2. Whether the Dead Can Be Assisted by the Works of the Living?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the dead cannot be assisted by the works of the living.

Objection 1. First, because the Apostle says (II Cor. 5. 10): *We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done.* Therefore nothing can accrue to a man from the works of others, which are done after his death and when he is no longer in the body.

Obj. 2. Further, This also seems to follow from the words of Apocalypse 14. 13, *Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord . . . for their works follow them.*

Obj. 3. Further, It belongs only to one who is on the way to advance on account of some deed. Now after death men are no longer wayfarers, because to them the words of Job 19. 8, refer: *He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass.* Therefore the dead cannot be assisted by a person’s intercessory works.

Obj. 4. Further, No one is assisted by the deed of another unless there be some community of life between them. Now there is no community between the dead and the living, as the Philosopher says.[2] Therefore the intercessions of the living do not profit the dead.

[2] *Ethics*, I, 11 (1101b35).

On the contrary are the words of II Machabees 12. 46: *It is . . . a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.* But this would not be profitable unless it were a help to them. Therefore the intercessory works of the living profit the dead.

Further, Augustine says (*De Cura pro Mort. i*):[3] “Of no small weight is the authority of the Church whereby she clearly approves of the custom by which a commendation of the dead has a place in the prayers which the priests pour forth to the Lord God at His altar.” This custom was established by the apostles themselves according to John Damascene in a sermon on works of intercession for the dead,[4] where he expresses himself thus: “Realizing the nature of the Mysteries the disciples of the Saviour and His holy apostles sanctioned a commemoration of those who had died in the faith, being made in the awe-inspiring and life-giving Mysteries.” This is also confirmed by the authority of Dionysius (*Eccl. Hier.*, VII),[1] where he mentions the rite of the Early Church in praying for the dead, and, moreover, asserts that the works of intercession of the living profit the dead.[2] Therefore we must believe this without any doubt.

[3] PL 40, 593.
[4] John Damascene, *De his qui in Fide Dormierunt*, III (PG 95, 249).
[1] PG 3, 556.
[2] Ibid. (PG 3, 560).

I answer that, Charity, which is the bond uniting the members of the Church, extends not only to the living, but also to the dead who die in charity. For charity which is the life of the soul, even as the soul is the life of the body, has no end: *Charity never falleth away* (I Cor. 13. 8). Moreover, the dead live in the memory of the living, and therefore the intention of the living can be directed to them. Hence the intercessory works of the living profit the dead in two ways even as they profit the living, both on account of the bond of charity and on account of the intention being directed to them. Nevertheless, we must not believe that the intercessory works of the living profit them so as to change their state from unhappiness to happiness or conversely; but they avail for the lessening of punishment or something of the kind that involves no change in the state of the dead.

Reply Obj. 1. Man while living in the body merited that such things should avail him after death. Therefore if he is assisted thereby after this life, this is, nevertheless, the result of the things he has done in the body.

Or we may reply, according to John Damascene in the sermon quoted above, that these words refer to the retribution which will be made at the final judgment, of eternal glory or eternal unhappiness; for then each one will receive only according as he himself has done in the body. Meanwhile, however, he can be assisted by the intercessions of the living.

Reply Obj. 2. The words quoted refer expressly to the sequel of eternal retribution as is clear from the opening words: *Blessed are the dead*, etc. Or we may reply that deeds done on their behalf are somewhat their own, as stated above (a. 1).

Reply Obj. 3. Although, strictly speaking, after death souls are not in the state of the way, yet in a certain respect they are still on the way, in so far as they are delayed awhile in their advance towards their final reward. Therefore, strictly speaking, their way is hedged in round about, so that they can no more be changed by any works in respect of the state of happiness or unhappiness. Yet their way is not so hedged around that they cannot be helped by others in the matter of their being delayed from receiving their final reward, because in this respect they are still wayfarers.

Reply Obj. 4. Although the communion of civic deeds, of which the Philosopher speaks, is impossible between the dead and the living, because the dead are outside civic life, the communication of the spiritual life is possible between them, for that life is founded on charity towards God, to Whom the spirits of the dead live.

## Article 3. Whether Suffrages Performed by Sinners Profit the Dead?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that intercessory works performed by sinners do not profit the dead.

Objection 1. For, according to John 9. 31, *God doth not hear sinners.* Now if their prayers were to profit those for whom they pray, they would be heard by God. Therefore the intercessory prayers performed by them do not profit the dead.

Obj. 2. Further, Gregory says (*Pastoral Care*, I, 10):[3] “When an offensive person is sent to intercede, the wrath of the angered party is provoked to harsher measures.” Now every sinner is offensive to God. Therefore God is not inclined to mercy by the intercession of sinners, and consequently their works of intercession are of no avail.

[3] PL 77, 23.

Obj. 3. Further, A person’s deed would seem to be more fruitful to the doer than to another. But a sinner merits nothing for himself by his deeds. Much less, therefore, can he merit for another.

Obj. 4. Further, Every meritorious work must be a living work, that is to say, formed by charity. Now works done by sinners are dead. Therefore the dead for whom they are done cannot be assisted thereby.

Obj. 5. On the contrary, No man can know for certain about another man whether the latter be in a state of sin or of grace. If, therefore, only those intercessory works were profitable that are done by those who are in a state of grace, a man could not know of whom to ask intercessory works for his dead, and consequently many would be deterred from obtaining works of intercession.

Obj. 6. Further, According to Augustine (*Enchiridion*, CX),[4] as quoted in the text (*IV Sentences*, d. 45),[5] the dead are assisted by works of intercession according as while living they merited to be assisted after death. Therefore the worth of prayers of intercession is measured according to the disposition of the person for whom they are performed. Therefore it would appear that it differs not whether they be performed by good or by wicked persons.

[4] PL 40, 283.
[5] Lombard, *Sentences*, IV, d. 45, chap. 2 (QR II, 1006).

I answer that, Two things may be considered in the intercessions performed by the wicked. First, the deed done (*opus operatum*), for instance the sacrifice of the altar. And since our sacraments have their efficacy from themselves independently of the deed of the doer, and are equally efficacious by whomsoever they are performed, in this respect the intercessory works of the wicked profit the departed. Secondly, we may consider the deed of the doer (*opus operans*), and then we must draw a distinction; because the deed of a sinner who offers intercessory works may be considered in one way in so far as it is his own deed, and thus it can in no way be meritorious either to himself or to another; in another way in so far as it is another’s deed, and this happens in two ways. First, when the sinner, offering works of intercession, represents the whole Church; for instance a priest when he performs the burial service in church. And since one in whose name or in whose stead a thing is done is understood to do it himself as Dionysius asserts (*Coel. Hier.*, XIII),[1] it follows that the intercessory works of that priest, although a sinner, profit the departed. Secondly, when he acts as the instrument of another, for the work of the instrument belongs more to the principal agent. Therefore, although he who acts as the instrument of another be not in a state of merit, his act may be meritorious on account of the principal agent; for instance if a servant being in sin do any work of mercy at the command of his master who has charity. Hence, if a person dying in charity command works of intercession to be offered for him, or if some other person having charity prescribe them, those works of intercession avail for the departed, even though the persons by whom they are performed be in sin. Nevertheless they would avail more if those persons were in charity, because then those works would be meritorious on two counts.

[1] Dionysius, *Coelestis Hierarchia*, XIII, Sect. 4 (PG 3, 305).

Reply Obj. 1. The prayer offered by a sinner is sometimes not his but another’s, and consequently in this respect is worthy to be heard by God. Nevertheless, God sometimes hears sinners, when, namely, they ask for something acceptable to God. For God dispenses His goods not only to the just but also to sinners (Matt. 5. 45), not indeed on account of their merits, but of His pity. Hence a gloss on John 9. 31, *God doth not hear sinners*, says[2] that he speaks as one “unanointed” and as not seeing clearly.

[2] *Glossa interlinearis* (V, 2151); Augustine, *In Joannem*, Tract. 44, 13 (PL 35, 1718).

Reply Obj. 2. Although the sinner’s prayer is not acceptable in so far as he is offensive, it may be acceptable to God on account of another in whose stead or at whose command he offers the prayer.

Reply Obj. 3. The reason why the sinner who performs these works of intercession gains nothing thereby is because he is not capable of profiting by reason of his own indisposition. Nevertheless, as stated above, it may in some way profit another, who is disposed.

Reply Obj. 4. Although the sinner’s deed is not living in so far as it is his own, it may be living in so far as it is another’s, as stated above.

Since, however, the arguments in the contrary sense would seem to show that it matters not whether one obtain intercession from good or from evil persons, we must reply to them also.

Reply Obj. 5. Although one cannot know for certain about another whether he be in the state of salvation, one may infer it with probability from what one sees outwardly of a man, for *a tree is known by its fruit* (Matt. 7. 16).

Reply Obj. 6. In order that intercession avail another, it is requisite that the one for whom it is performed be capable of availing by it, and a man has become capable of this by his own works which he did in his lifetime. This is what Augustine means to say. Nevertheless, works must be such that they can profit him, and this depends not on the person for whom the intercession is performed, but rather on the one who offers the intercessory works whether by performing them or by commanding them.

## Article 4. Whether Intercessory Prayers Offered by the Living for the Dead Profit Those Who Offer Them?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that intercessory works offered by the living for the dead do not profit those who offer them.

Objection 1. For according to human justice a man is not absolved from his own debt if he pays a debt for another man. Therefore a man is not absolved from his own debt for the reason that by offering works of intercession he has paid the debt of the one for whom he offered them.

Obj. 2. Further, Whatever a man does, he should do it as best he can. Now it is better to assist two than one. Therefore if one who by works of intercession has paid the debt of a dead person is freed from his own debt, it would seem that one ought never to satisfy for oneself but always for another.

Obj. 3. Further, If the satisfaction of one who satisfies for another profits him equally with the one for whom he satisfies, it will likewise equally profit a third person if he satisfy for him at the same time, and likewise a fourth and so on. Therefore he might satisfy for all by one work of satisfaction, which is absurd.

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 34. 13): *My prayer shall be turned into my bosom.* Therefore, in like manner, intercessory works that are offered for others profit those who satisfy.

Further, John Damascene says in the sermon *On those who fell asleep in the faith*:[1] “Just as when about to anoint a sick man with the ointment or other holy oil, first of all he,” namely the anointer, “shares in the anointing and thus proceeds to anoint the patient, so whoever strives for his neighbour’s salvation first of all profits himself and afterwards his neighbour.” And thus the question at issue is answered.

[1] John Damascene, *De his qui in Fide Dormierunt*, XVIII (PG 95, 264).

I answer that, The work of intercession that is done for another may be considered in two ways. First, as expiating punishment by way of compensation which is a condition of satisfaction, and in this way the work of intercession that is counted as belonging to the person for whom it is done, while absolving him from the debt of punishment, does not absolve the performer from his own debt of punishment, because in this compensation we have to consider the equality of justice, and this work of satisfaction can be equal to the one debt without being equal to the other, for the debts of two sinners require a greater satisfaction than the debt of one. Secondly, it may be considered as meriting eternal life, and this it has as proceeding from its root, which is charity, and in this way it profits not only the person for whom it is done, but also and still more the doer.

This suffices for the Replies to the Objections; for the first considered the work of intercession as a work of satisfaction, while the others consider it as meritorious.

## Article 5. Whether Works of Intercession Profit Those Who Are in Hell?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that works of intercession profit those who are in hell.

Objection 1. For it is written (II Machabees 12. 40): *They found under the coats of the slain some of the donaries of the idols . . ., which the law forbiddeth to the Jews,* and yet we read further on (verse 43) that *Judas sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem . . . to be offered for the sins of the dead.* Now it is clear that they sinned mortally through acting against the Law, and consequently that they died in mortal sin, and were taken to hell. Therefore works of intercession profit those who are in hell.

Obj. 2. Further, The text (*IV Sentences*, d. 45)[2] quotes the saying of Augustine (*Enchiridion*, CX)[3] that “those whom works of intercession profit gain either entire forgiveness, or at least an abatement of their damnation.” Now only those who are in hell are said to be damned. Therefore works of intercession profit even those who are in hell.

[2] Lombard, *Sentences*, IV, d. 45, chap. 2 (QR II, 1007).
[3] PL 40, 283.

Obj. 3. Further, Dionysius says (*Eccl. Hier.*, cap. ult.):[4] “If here the prayers of the just avail those who are alive, how much more do they, after death, profit those alone who are worthy of their holy prayers?” Hence we may gather that intercessory works are more profitable to the dead than to the living. Now they profit the living even though they be in mortal sin, for the Church prays daily for sinners that they be converted to God. Therefore intercessory works avail also for the dead who are in mortal sin.

[4] PG 3, 561.

Obj. 4. Further, In the *Lives of the Fathers* (III, 172; VI, 3)[5] we read, and John Damascene relates[6] in a sermon of his that Macarius discovered the skull of a dead man on the road, and that after praying he asked whose head it was, and the head replied that it had belonged to a pagan priest who was condemned to hell; and yet he confessed that he and others were assisted by the prayers of Macarius. Therefore the intercessory works of the Church profit even those who are in hell.

[5] PL 73, 797, 1013.
[6] John Damascene, *De his qui in Fide Dormierunt*, X (PG 95, 256).

Obj. 5. Further, John Damascene in the same sermon[7] relates that Gregory, while praying for Trajan, heard a voice from heaven saying to him: “I have heard thy voice, and I pardon Trajan,” and of this fact John Damascene adds in the same sermon (ibid.) “the whole East and West are witnesses.” Yet it is clear that Trajan was in hell, since “he put many martyrs to a cruel death” (ibid.). Therefore the intercessory works of the Church avail even for those who are in hell.

[7] PG 95, 264.

On the contrary, Dionysius says (*Eccl. Hier.*, VII):[1] “The high priest prays not for the unclean, because by so doing he would act counter to the Divine order,” and a commentator[2] on the same place says that “he prays not that sinners be forgiven, because his prayer for them would not be heard.” Therefore works of intercession do not avail those who are in hell.

[1] PG 3, 564.
[2] Maximus, *In De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia*, chap. VIII, Pt. III, sect. 7 (PG 4, 181); Cf. Albert the Great, *In Sentences*, IV, d. 45, a. 3, *Sed contra* 2 (BO XXX, 610).

Further, Gregory says (*Moralia in Job*, XXXIV, 19):[3] “There is the same reason for not praying then (namely, after the judgment day) for men condemned to the everlasting fire, as there is now for not praying for the devil and his angels who are sentenced to eternal punishment, and for this same reason the saints pray not for dead unbelieving and wicked men, because, indeed, knowing them to be already condemned to eternal punishment, they shrink from pleading for them by the merit of their prayers before they are summoned to the presence of the just Judge.”

[3] PL 76, 739.

Further, The text (*IV Sentences*, d. 45)[4] quotes the words of Augustine:[5] “If a man depart this life without the faith that worketh by charity and its sacraments, in vain do his friends have recourse to such acts of kindness.” Now all the damned come under that head. Therefore intercessory works do not profit them.

[4] Peter Lombard, *Sentences*, IV, d. 45, chap. 2 (QR II, 1007).
[5] Augustine, *Sermones ad Populum*, Sermo CLXXII, chap. 2 (PL 38, 937).

I answer that, There have been three opinions about the damned. For some have said that a twofold distinction must be made in this matter. First, as to time; for they said that after the judgment day no one in hell will be assisted by any intercession, but that before the judgment day some are assisted by the intercessory works of the Church. Secondly, they made a distinction among those who are detained in hell. Some of these, they said, are very bad, those namely who have died without faith and the sacraments, and these, since they were not of the Church, neither by grace nor by name, the intercessory works of the Church cannot avail; while others are not very bad, those namely who belonged to the Church as actual members, who had the faith, frequented the sacraments and performed works generically good, and for these the intercessory works of the Church ought to avail.

Yet they were confronted with a difficulty which troubled them, for it would seem to follow from this (since the punishment of hell is finite in intensity although infinite in duration) that a multiplicity of intercessory works would take away that punishment altogether, which is the error of Origen,[6] and consequently they endeavored in various ways to avoid this difficulty.

[6] Origen, *De Principiis*, I, 6 (PG 11, 169); cf. Gregory the Great, *Moralia in Job*, XXXIV, 19 (PL 76, 737).

For Praepositinus said[7] that intercessory works for the damned can be so multiplied that they are entirely freed from punishment, not absolutely as Origen maintained, but for a time, namely till the judgment day, for their souls will be reunited to their bodies, and will be cast back into the punishments of hell without hope of pardon. But this opinion seems incompatible with Divine providence, which leaves nothing unordered in things. For guilt cannot be restored to order save by punishment; therefore it is impossible for punishment to cease, unless first of all guilt be expiated, so that, as guilt remains for ever in the damned, their punishment will in no way be interrupted.

[7] Praepositinus, *Summa*, Pt. IV (fol. 85rb); see William of Auxerre, *Summa Aurea*, Pt. IV (303ra); Bonaventure, *In Sentences*, IV, d. 46, Q. 1, A. 1 (QR IV, 957); Albert the Great, *In Sentences*, IV, d. 46, a. 2 (BO XXX, 630).

For this reason the followers of Gilbert de la Porrée[8] devised another explanation. These said that the process in the lessening of punishments by intercessory works is as the process in dividing a line, which though finite, is indefinitely divisible, and is never destroyed by division, if it is diminished not by equal but by proportionate quantities, for instance if we begin by taking away a quarter of the whole and, secondly, a quarter of that quarter, and then a quarter of this second quarter, and so on indefinitely. In like manner, they say by the first work of intercession a certain proportion of the punishment is taken away, and by the second an equally proportionate part of the remainder. But this explanation is in many ways defective. First, because it seems that indefinite division which is applicable to continuous quantity cannot be transferred to spiritual quantity; secondly, because there is no reason why the second work of intercession, if it be of equal worth, should diminish the punishment less than the first; thirdly, because punishment cannot be diminished unless guilt be diminished, even as it cannot be done away unless the guilt be done away; fourthly, because in the division of a line we come at length to something which is not sensible, for a sensible body is not indefinitely divisible, and thus it would follow that after many works of intercession the remaining punishment would be so little as not to be felt, and thus would no longer be a punishment.

[8] Cf. Albert the Great, *In Sentences*, IV, d. 46, a. 2 (BO XXX, 630).

Hence others found another explanation. For William of Auxerre said[1] that intercessory works profit the damned not by diminishing or interrupting their punishment, but by fortifying the person punished, even as a man who is

[1] William of Auxerre, *Summa Aurea*, Pt. IV, tr. 1, chap. 1, Q. 1 (303ra).

carrying a heavy load might bathe his face in water, for thus he would be enabled to carry it better, and yet his load would be none the lighter. But this again is impossible, because according to Gregory (*Moralia*, IX, 65) [2] a man suffers more or less from the eternal fire according as his guilt deserves, and consequently some suffer more, some less, from the same fire; therefore since the guilt of the damned remains unchanged, it cannot be that he suffers less punishment. Moreover, this opinion is presumptuous, as being in opposition to the statements of holy men, and groundless as being based on no authority. It is also unreasonable. First, because the damned in hell are cut off from the bond of charity in virtue of which the departed are in touch with the works of the living. Secondly, because they have entirely come to the end of life, and have received the final award for their merits, even as the saints who are in heaven. For the remaining punishment or glory of the body does not make them to be wayfarers, since glory essentially and radically resides in the soul. It is the same with the unhappiness of the damned, and so their punishment cannot be diminished as neither can the glory of the saints be increased as to the essential reward.

However, we may admit, in a certain measure, the manner in which, according to some, intercessory works profit the damned, if it be said that they profit neither by diminishing nor interrupting their punishment, nor again by diminishing their sense of punishment, but by withdrawing from the damned some matter of sorrow, which matter they might have if they knew themselves to be so outcast as to be a care to no one; and this matter of sorrow is withdrawn from them when intercessory works are offered for them. Yet even this is impossible according to the general law, because as Augustine says (*De Cura pro Mortuis*, xiii) [3]—and this applies especially to the damned—"the spirits of the departed are where they see nothing of what men do or of what happens to them in this life," and consequently they know not when intercessory works are offered for them, unless this relief be granted from above to some of the damned in despite of the general law. This, however, is a matter of great uncertainty; therefore it is safer to say absolutely that intercessory prayers do not profit the damned, nor does the Church intend to pray for them, as appears from the authors quoted above. [4]

### Reply Obj. 1.
The donaries to the idols were not found on those dead so that they might be taken as a sign that they were carried off in reverence to the idols, but they took them as conquerors because they were due to them by right of war. They sinned, however, venially by covetousness, and consequently they were not damned in hell, and thus works of intercession could profit them. Or we may say, according to some, that in the midst of fighting, seeing they were in danger, they repented of their sin, according to Ps. 77:34, *When He slew them, then they sought Him*, and this can be held as a probable opinion. Therefore the offering was made for them.

### Reply Obj. 2.
In these words damnation is taken in a broad sense for any kind of punishment, so as to include also the punishment of purgatory which is sometimes entirely expiated by works of intercession, and sometimes not entirely, but diminished.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Intercession for a dead person is more acceptable than for a living person, as regards his being in greater want, since he cannot help himself as a living person can. But a living person is better off in that he can be taken from the state of mortal sin to the state of grace, which cannot be said of the dead. Hence there is not the same reason for praying for the dead as for the living.

### Reply Obj. 4.
This assistance did not consist in a diminishment of their punishment, but in this alone (as stated in the same place) that when he prayed they were permitted to see one another, and in this they had a certain joy, not real but imaginary, in the fulfilment of their desire. Even so the demons are said to rejoice when they draw men into sin, although this in no way diminishes their punishment, as neither is the joy of the angels diminished by the fact that they take pity on our ills.

### Reply Obj. 5.
Concerning the incident of Trajan it may be supposed with probability that he was recalled to life at the prayers of blessed Gregory, and thus obtained the grace whereby he received the pardon of his sins and in consequence was freed from punishment. The same applies to all those who were miraculously raised from the dead, many of whom were evidently idolaters and damned. For we must say likewise of all such persons that they were consigned to hell, not finally, but as was actually due to their own merits according to justice, and that according to higher causes, in view of which it was foreseen that they would be recalled to life, they were to be disposed of otherwise.

Or we may say with some that Trajan’s soul was not freed absolutely from the debt of eternal punishment, but that his punishment was suspended for a time, that is, until the judgment day. Nor does it follow that this is the general result of works of intercession, because things happen differently in accordance with the general law from that which is permitted in particular cases and by privilege. Even so the bounds of human affairs differ from those of the signs of the Divine power as Augustine says (*De Cura pro Mortuis*, xvi). [1]

## Article 6. Whether Works of Intercession Profit Those Who Are in Purgatory?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that works of intercession do not profit even those who are in purgatory.

### Objection 1.
For purgatory is a part of hell. Now "there is no redemption in hell," [2] and it is written (Ps. 6:6), *Who shall confess to Thee in hell?* Therefore works of intercession do not profit those who are in purgatory.

### Obj. 2.
Further, The punishment of purgatory is finite. Therefore if some of the punishment is abated by works of intercession, it would be possible to have such a great number of prayers of intercession that the punishment would be entirely remitted, and consequently the sin entirely unpunished; and this would seem incompatible with Divine justice.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Souls are in purgatory in order that they may be purified there, and being pure may come to the kingdom. Now nothing can be purified unless something be done to it. Therefore intercessory works offered by the living do not diminish the punishment of purgatory.

### Obj. 4.
If intercessory works availed those who are in purgatory, those especially would seem to avail them which are offered at their behest. Yet these do not always avail; for instance, if a person before dying were to provide for so many works of intercession to be offered for him that if they were offered they would suffice for the remission of his entire punishment. Now supposing these works of intercession to be delayed until he is released from punishment, they will profit him nothing. For it cannot be said that they profit him before they are discharged, and after they are fulfilled he no longer needs them, since he is already released. Therefore works of intercession do not avail those who are in purgatory.

### On the contrary.
As quoted in the text (*IV Sent.* d. 45), [3] Augustine says (*Enchiridion*, cx) [4] that prayers of intercession profit those who are not very good or not very bad. Now such are those who are detained in purgatory. Therefore, etc.

Further, Dionysius says (*Ecclesiastica Hierarchia*, vii) [5] that "the godlike priest in praying for the departed prays for those who lived a holy life, and yet contracted certain stains through human frailty." Now such persons are detained in purgatory. Therefore, etc.

### I answer that.
The punishment of purgatory is intended to supplement the satisfaction which was not fully completed in the body. Consequently, since, as stated above (a. 1, Reply 2; Q. xiii, A. 2), the works of one person can avail for another’s satisfaction, whether the latter be living or dead, the intercessory works of the living, without any doubt, profit those who are in purgatory.

### Reply Obj. 1.
The words quoted refer to those who are in the hell of the damned, where there is no redemption for those who are finally consigned to that punishment. We may also reply with Damascene (*Sermon de Dormientibus*) [6] that such statements are to be explained with reference to the lower causes, that is according to the demands of the merits of those who are consigned to those punishments. But according to the Divine mercy, which transcends human merits, it happens otherwise through the prayers of the just than is implied by the expressions quoted in the authorities above. Now "God changes His sentence but not His counsel," as Gregory says. [1] Hence Damascene (loc. cit.) [2] quotes as instances of this the Ninevites, Achab and Ezechias, in whom it is apparent that the sentence pronounced against them by God was commuted by the Divine mercy. [3]

### Reply Obj. 2.
It is not unreasonable that the punishment of those who are in purgatory be entirely done away by the multiplicity of intercessions. But it does not follow that the sins remain unpunished, because the punishment of one undertaken in lieu of another is credited to that other.

### Reply Obj. 3.
The purifying of the soul by the punishment of purgatory is nothing else than the expiation of the guilt that hinders it from obtaining glory. And since, as stated above, the guilt of one person can be expiated by the punishment which another undergoes in his stead, it is not unreasonable that one person be purified by another satisfying for him.

### Reply Obj. 4.
Intercession avails on two counts, namely the action of the agent and the action done (*ex opere operante* and *ex opere operato*). By action done I mean not only the sacrament of the Church, but the effect incidental to that action—thus from the giving of alms there follow the relief of the poor and their prayer to God for the deceased. In like manner the action of the agent may be considered in relation either to the principal agent or to the secondary agent. I say, then, that the dying person, as soon as he provides for certain prayers of intercession to be offered for him, receives the full reward of those intercessions, even before they are discharged, as regards the efficacy of the intercessions that results from the action as proceeding from the principal agent. But as regards the efficacy of the intercessions arising from the action done or from the action as proceeding from the secondary agent, he does not receive the fruit before the intercessions are discharged. And if, before this, he happens to be released from his punishment, he will in this respect be deprived of the fruit of the intercessions, and this will fall back upon those by whose fault he was then defrauded. For it is not unreasonable that a person be defrauded in temporal matters by another’s fault—and the punishment of purgatory is temporal—although as regards the eternal retribution none can be defrauded save by his own fault.

## Article 7. Whether Works of Intercession Avail the Children Who Are in Limbo?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that works of intercession avail the children who are in limbo.

### Objection 1.
For they are not detained there except for another’s sin. Therefore it is most fitting that they should be assisted by the intercessory prayers of others.

### Obj. 2.
Further, In the text (*IV Sent.* d. 45) [4] it is held from the words of Augustine (*Enchiridion*, cx) [5] the intercessory works of the Church obtain forgiveness for those who are not very bad. Now children are not reckoned among those who are very bad, since "their punishment is very light." [6] Therefore the intercessory prayers of the Church avail them.

### On the contrary.
The text (ibid.) quotes Augustine as saying [7] that intercessory prayers do not avail those who have departed hence without the faith that works by love. Now the children departed thus. Therefore intercessory works do not avail them.

### I answer that.
Unbaptized children are not detained in limbo save because they lack the state of grace. Hence, since the state of the dead cannot be changed by the works of the living, especially as regards the merit of the essential reward or punishment, the intercessions of the living cannot profit the children in limbo.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Although original sin is such that one person can be assisted by another on its account, nevertheless the souls of the children in limbo are in such a state that they cannot be assisted, because after this life there is no time for obtaining grace.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Augustine is speaking of those who are not very bad, but have been baptized. This is clear from what precedes: "Since these sacrifices, whether of the altar or of any alms whatsoever, are offered for those who have been baptized," etc.

## Article 8. Whether Works of Intercession Profit the Saints in Heaven?

We proceed thus to the Eighth Article: It would seem that in some way intercessory works profit the saints in heaven.

### Objection 1.
For the words of the collect in the mass say: [1] "Even as they (that is, the sacraments) avail thy saints unto glory, so may they profit us unto healing." Now foremost among all intercessions is the sacrifice of the altar. Therefore intercessions profit the saints in heaven.

### Obj. 2.
Further, The sacraments cause what they signify. Now the third part of the host, that namely which is dropped into the chalice, signifies those who lead a happy life in heaven. Therefore the intercessions of the Church profit those who are in heaven.

### Obj. 3.
Further, The saints rejoice in heaven not only in their own goods, but also in the goods of others; hence it is written (Luke 15:10): *There is* (Vulg.,—*shall be*) *joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance*. Therefore the joy of the saints in heaven increases on account of the good works of the living, and consequently our works of intercession also profit them.

### Obj. 4.
Further, The Damascene says (*Sermon de Dormientibus*) [2] quoting the words of Chrysostom: [3] "For if the heathens," he says, "burn the dead together with what has belonged to them, how much more shouldst thou, a believer, send forth a believer together with what has belonged to him, not that they also may be brought to ashes like him, but that thou mayest surround him with greater glory by so doing; and if he be a sinner who has died, that thou mayest loose him from his sins, and if he be just, that thou mayest add to his meed and reward!" And thus the same conclusion follows.

### On the contrary.
As quoted in the text (*IV Sent.* d. 45), [4] Augustine says: [5] "It is insulting to pray for a martyr in church, since we ought to commend ourselves to his prayers."

Further, To be assisted belongs to one who is in need. But the saints in heaven are without any need whatever. Therefore they are not assisted by the intercessions of the Church.

### I answer that.
Intercession by its very nature implies the giving of some assistance, which does not apply to one who suffers no default, since no one is able to be assisted except he who is in need. Hence, as the saints in heaven are free from all need, being inebriated with the plenty of God’s house (Ps. 35:10), they are not able to be assisted by works of intercession.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Such expressions do not mean that the saints receive an increase of glory in themselves through our observing their feasts, but that we profit thereby in celebrating their glory with greater solemnity. Thus, through our knowing or praising God, and through His glory thus increasing somewhat in us, there accrues something, not to God, but to us.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Although the sacraments cause what they signify, they do not produce this effect in respect of everything that they signify; otherwise, since they signify Christ, they would produce something in Christ (which is absurd). But they produce their effect on the recipient of the sacrament in virtue of that which is signified by the sacrament. Thus it does not follow that the sacrifices offered for the faithful departed profit the saints, but that by the merits of the saints which we commemorate, or which are signified in the sacrament, they profit others for whom they are offered.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Although the saints in heaven rejoice in all our goods, it does not follow that if our joys be increased their joy is also increased formally, but only materially, because every passion is increased formally in respect of the formal aspect of its object. Now the formal aspect of the saints’ joy, no matter what they rejoice in, is God Himself, in Whom they cannot rejoice more and less, for otherwise their essential reward, consisting of their joy in God, would vary. Hence from the fact that the goods are multiplied, wherein they rejoice with God as the formal aspect of their joy, it does not follow that their joy is intensified, but that they rejoice in more things. Consequently it does not follow that they are assisted by our works.

### Reply Obj. 4.
The sense is not that an increase of meed or reward accrues to the saint from the intercessions offered by a person, but that this accrues to the offerer. Or we may reply that the blessed departed may derive a reward from intercessions through having, while living, provided for intercessory works to be offered for himself, and this was meritorious for him.

## Article 9. Whether the Prayers of the Church, the Sacrifice of the Altar, and Alms Profit the Departed?

We proceed thus to the Ninth Article: It would seem that the souls of the departed are not assisted only by the prayers of the Church, the sacrifice of the altar and alms, or that they are not assisted by them chiefly.

### Objection 1.
For punishment should compensate for punishment. Now fasting is more penal than almsgiving or prayer. Therefore fasting profits more as intercession than any of the above.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Gregory numbers fasting together with these three, as stated in the *Decretals* (xiii, q. ii, cap. 22): [1] "The souls of the departed are released in four ways, either by the offerings of priests, or the alms of their friends, or the prayers of the saints, or the fasting of their kinsfolk." Therefore the three mentioned here [2] are insufficiently numbered by Augustine. [3]

### Obj. 3.
Further, Baptism is the greatest of the sacraments, especially as regards its effect. Therefore Baptism and other sacraments ought to be offered for the departed equally with or more than the sacrament of the altar.

### Obj. 4.
Further, This would seem to follow from the words of 1 Cor. 15:29, *If the dead rise not again at all, why are they then baptized for them?* Therefore Baptism avails as intercession for the dead.

### Obj. 5.
Further, In different masses there is the same sacrifice of the altar. If, therefore, sacrifice, and not the mass, be counted among the intercessions, it would seem that the effect would be the same whatever mass be said for a deceased person, whether in honour of the Blessed Virgin or of the Holy Ghost, or any other. Yet this seems contrary to the ordinance of the Church which has appointed a special mass for the dead.

### Obj. 6.
Further, The Damascene (*Sermon de Dormientibus*) [4] teaches that candles and oil should be offered for the dead. Therefore not only the offering of the sacrifice of the altar, but also other offerings should be reckoned among intercessions for the dead.

### I answer that.
The intercessory works of the living profit the dead in so far as the latter are united to the living in charity, and in so far as the intention of the living is directed to the dead. Consequently those works are by nature best adapted to assist the dead which pertain chiefly to the communication of charity, or to the directing of one’s intention to another person. Now the sacrament of the Eucharist belongs chiefly to charity, since it is the sacrament of ecclesiastical unity, because it contains Him in Whom the whole Church is united and incorporated, namely Christ; therefore the Eucharist is as it were the origin and bond of charity. Again, chief among the effects of charity is the work of almsgiving. Therefore on the part of charity these two, namely the sacrifice of the Church and almsgiving are the chief helps for the dead. But on the part of the intention directed to the dead the chief help is prayer, because prayer by its very nature implies relation not only to the person who prays, even as other works do, but more directly still to that which we pray for. Hence these three are accounted the principal means of succouring the dead, although we must allow that any other goods whatsoever that are done out of charity for the dead are profitable to them.

### Reply Obj. 1.
When one person satisfies for another, the point to consider, in order that the effect of his satisfaction reach the other, is the thing whereby the satisfaction of one passes to another, rather than even the punishment undergone by way of satisfaction; although the punishment expiates more the guilt of the one who satisfies, in so far as it is a kind of medicine. And consequently the three previously mentioned are more profitable to the departed than fasting.

### Reply Obj. 2.
It is true that fasting can profit the departed by reason of charity, and on account of the intention being directed to the departed. Nevertheless, fasting does not by its nature contain anything pertaining to charity or to the directing of the intention, and these things are extrinsic to it as it were, and for this reason Augustine did not number, while Gregory did place, fasting among the suffrages for the dead.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Baptism is a spiritual regeneration, and therefore just as by generation being does not accrue save to the being generated, so Baptism produces its effect only in the person baptized, as regards the deed done; and yet as regards the deed of the doer, whether of the baptizer or of the baptized, it may profit others even as other meritorious works. On the other hand, the Eucharist is the sign of ecclesiastical unity, and therefore by reason of the deed done its effect can pass to another, which is not the case with the other sacraments.

### Reply Obj. 4.
According to a gloss [5] this passage may be expounded in two ways. First, thus: "If the dead rise not again, nor did Christ rise again, why are they baptized for them? that is, for sins, since they are not pardoned if Christ rose not again," because in Baptism not only Christ’s passion but also His resurrection operates, for the latter is in a sense the cause of our spiritual resurrection. Secondly, thus: "There have been some misguided persons who were baptized for those who had departed this life without baptism, thinking that this would profit them"; and according to this explanation the Apostle is speaking, in the above words, merely according to the opinion of certain persons.

### Reply Obj. 5.
In the office of the mass there is not only a sacrifice but also prayers. Hence the mass contains two of the things mentioned by Augustine (loc. cit.), namely prayer and sacrifice. As regards the sacrifice offered the mass profits equally the departed, no matter in whose honour it be said, and this is the principal thing done in the mass. But as regards the prayers, that mass is most profitable in which the prayers are appointed for this purpose. Nevertheless, this defect may be supplied by the greater devotion, either of the one who says mass, or of the one who orders the mass to be said, or again, by the intercession of the saint whose help is sought in the mass.

### Reply Obj. 6.
This offering of candles or oil may profit the departed in so far as they are a kind of alms, for they are given for the worship of the Church or for the use of the faithful.

## Article 10. Whether the Indulgences of the Church Profit the Dead?

We proceed thus to the Tenth Article: It would seem that the indulgences granted by the Church profit even the dead.

### Objection 1.
First, on account of the custom of the Church, who orders the preaching of a crusade in order that someone may gain an indulgence for himself and for two or three and sometimes even ten souls, both of the living and of the dead. [1] But this would amount to a deception unless they profited the dead. Therefore indulgences profit the dead.

### Obj. 2.
Further, The merit of the whole Church is more efficacious than that of one person. Now personal merit serves as an intercession for the departed, for instance in the case of almsgiving. Much more therefore does the merit of the Church on which indulgences are founded.

### Obj. 3.
Further, The indulgences of the Church profit those who are members of the Church. Now those who are in purgatory are members of the Church, for otherwise the intercessory prayers of the Church would not profit them. Therefore it would seem that indulgences profit the departed.

### On the contrary.
In order that indulgences may avail a person, there must be a fitting cause for granting the indulgence. Now there can be no such cause on the part of the dead, since they can do nothing that is of profit to the Church, and it is for such a cause that indulgences are chiefly granted. Therefore, it seems, indulgences do not profit the dead.

Further, Indulgences are regulated according to the decision of the party who grants them. If, therefore, indulgences could avail the dead, it would be in the power of the party granting

them to release a deceased person entirely from punishment, which seems to be absurd.

I answer that, An indulgence may profit a person in two ways: in one way, principally; in another, secondarily. It profits principally the person who avails himself of an indulgence, who, namely, does that for which the indulgence is granted, for instance, one who visits the shrine of some saint. Hence, since the dead can do none of those things for which indulgences are granted, indulgences cannot avail them directly.

However, they profit secondarily and indirectly the person for whom one does that which is the cause of the indulgence. This is sometimes feasible and sometimes not, according to the different forms of indulgence. For if the form of indulgence be such as this: “Whosoever does this or that shall gain so much indulgence,” he who does this cannot transfer the fruit of the indulgence to another, because it is not in his power to apply to a particular person the intention of the Church, who dispenses the common prayers of intercession from which indulgences derive their value, as stated above (q. xxvii, a. 3, Reply 2). If, however, the indulgence be granted in this form: “Whosoever does this or that, he, his father, or any other person connected with him and detained in purgatory, will gain so much indulgence,” an indulgence of this kind will avail not only a living but also a deceased person. For there is no reason why the Church is able to transfer the common merits, on which indulgences are based, to the living and not to the dead.

Nor does it follow that a prelate of the Church can free souls from purgatory at his choice, since for indulgences to avail there must be a fitting cause for granting them, as stated above (q. xxv, a. 2).

### Article 11. Whether the Burial Service Profits the Dead?

We proceed thus to the Eleventh Article: It would seem that the burial service profits the dead.

Objection 1. For Damascene (*Serm. de Dormitione*)1 quotes Athanasius as saying: “Even though he who has departed in godliness be taken up to heaven, do not hesitate to call upon God and to burn oil and wax at his tomb: for such things are pleasing to God and receive a great reward from Him.” Now the like pertain to the burial service. Therefore the burial service profits the dead.

Obj. 2. Further, According to Augustine,2 “In olden times the funerals of just men were cared for with dutiful piety, their obsequies celebrated, their graves provided, and themselves while living charged their children touching the burial or even the translation of their bodies.” But they would not have done this unless the tomb and things of this kind conferred something on the dead. Therefore this kind of thing profits the dead in some way.

Obj. 3. Further, No one does a work of mercy on someone’s behalf unless it profit him. Now burying the dead is counted among the works of mercy, and therefore Augustine says:3 “Tobias, as attested by the angel, is declared to have found favour with God by burying the dead.” Therefore such burial observances profit the dead.

Obj. 4. Further, It is unbecoming to assert that the devotion of the faithful is fruitless. Now some, out of devotion, arrange for their burial in some religious locality. Therefore the burial service profits the dead.

Obj. 5. Further, God is more inclined to pity than to condemn. Now burial in a sacred place is hurtful to some if they are unworthy, and therefore Gregory says (*Dialogues*, IV, 50):4 “If those who are burdened with grievous sins are buried in the church this will lead to their more severe condemnation rather than to their release.” Much more, therefore, should we say that the burial service profits the good.

On the contrary, Augustine says (*De Cura pro Mortuis*, XVIII):5 “Whatever service is done the body is no aid to salvation, but an office of humanity.”

Further, Gregory says:6 “The funereal equipment, the disposition of the grave, the solemnity of the obsequies are a comfort to the living rather than a help to the dead.”

Further, Our Lord said (Luke 12:4): *Be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do*. Now after death the bodies of the saints can be hindered from being buried, as we read of having been done to certain martyrs at Lyons in Gaul (Eusebius, *Ecclesiastical History*, VI, 1).7 Therefore the dead take no harm if their bodies remain unburied, and consequently the burial service does not profit them.

I answer that, We have recourse to burial for the sake of both the living and the dead. For the sake of the living, lest their eyes be revolted by the disfigurement of the corpse, and their bodies be infected by the stench, and this as regards the body. But it profits the living also spiritually in so far as our belief in the resurrection is affirmed thereby. It profits the dead in so far as one bears the dead in mind and prays for them through looking on their burial place; hence, too, a monument takes its name from remembrance, for a monument is something that recalls the mind (*monens mentem*), as Augustine observes.8 It was, however, a pagan error that burial was profitable to the dead by procuring rest for his soul, for they believed that the soul could not be at rest until the body was buried, which is altogether ridiculous and absurd.

That, moreover, burial in a sacred place profits the dead, does not result from the action done, but rather from the action itself of the doer, when, that is, the dead person himself, or another, arranges for his body to be buried in a sacred place, and commends him to the patronage of some saint, by whose prayers we must believe that he is assisted, as well as to the intercessory works of those who serve the holy place, and pray more frequently and more specially for those who are buried in their midst. But such things as are done for the display of the obsequies are profitable to the living as being a consolation to them; and yet they can also profit the dead, not directly but indirectly, in so far as men are aroused to pity thereby and consequently to pray, or in so far as the outlay on the burial brings either assistance to the poor or adornment to the church, for it is in this sense that the burial of the dead is accounted among the works of mercy.

Reply Obj. 1. By bringing oil and candles to the tombs of the dead we profit them indirectly, either as offering them to the Church and as giving them to the poor, or as doing this in reverence of God. Hence, after the words quoted we read: “For oil and candles are a holocaust.”

Reply Obj. 2. The fathers of old arranged for the burial of their bodies, so as to show that “the bodies of the dead are the object of Divine providence, not that there is any feeling in a dead body, but in order to confirm the belief in the resurrection,” as Augustine says.1 Hence, also, they wished to be buried in the land of promise,2 where they believed Christ’s birth and death would take place, Whose resurrection is the cause of our rising again.

Reply Obj. 3. Since flesh is a part of man’s nature, man has a natural affection for his flesh, according to Ephesians 5:29, *No man ever hated his own flesh*. Hence in accordance with this natural affection a man has during life a certain solicitude for what will become of his body after death, and he would grieve if he had a presentiment that some indignity would happen to his body. Consequently those who love a man, through being conformed to the one they love in his affection for himself, treat his body with loving care. For as Augustine says:3 “If a father’s garment and ring, and whatever such like is the more dear to those whom they leave behind the greater their affection is towards their parents, in no way are the bodies themselves to be spurned which truly we wear in more familiar and close conjunction than anything else we put on.”

Reply Obj. 4. As Augustine says (*De Cura pro Mortuis*, IV),4 the devotion of the faithful is not fruitless when they arrange for their friends to be buried in holy places, since by so doing they commend their dead to the prayers of the saints, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 5. The wicked man dead takes no harm by being buried in a holy place, except in so far as he procured such a burial place, unfitting for him, by reason of human glory.

### Article 12. Whether Works of Intercession Offered for One Deceased Person Profit the Person for Whom They Are Offered More Than Others?

We proceed thus to the Twelfth Article: It would seem that works of intercession offered for one deceased person are not more profitable to the one for whom they are offered, than to others.

Objection 1. For spiritual light is more communicable than a material light. Now a material light, for instance, of a candle, though kindled for one person only, avails equally all those who are gathered together, though the candle be not lit for them. Therefore, since intercessory works are a kind of spiritual light, though they be offered for one person in particular, do not avail him any more than the others who are in purgatory.

Obj. 2. Further, As stated in the text (IV *Sentences*, distinction 45),5 intercessory works avail the dead “in so far as during this life they merited that they might avail them afterwards.” Now some merited that works of intercession might avail them more than those for whom they are offered. Therefore they profit more by those works of intercession, for otherwise their merits would be rendered unavailing.

Obj. 3. Further, The poor have not so many works of intercession offered for them as the rich. Therefore if the intercessory works offered for certain people profit them alone, or profit them more than others, the poor would be worse off; yet this is contrary to our Lord’s saying (Luke 6:20): *Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God*.

On the contrary, Human justice is copied from Divine justice. But if a person pay another’s debt human justice releases the latter alone. Therefore since he who offers works of intercession for another pays the debt, in a sense, of the person for whom he offers them, they profit this person alone.

Further, just as a man by offering works of intercession satisfies somewhat for a deceased person, so, too, sometimes a person can satisfy for a living person. Now where one satisfies for a living person the satisfaction counts only for the person for whom it is offered. Therefore one also who offers works of intercession profits him alone for whom he offers them.

I answer that, There have been two opinions on this question. For some, like Praepositinus,6 have said that works of intercession offered for one particular person avail chiefly, not the person for whom they are offered, but those who are most worthy. And they instanced a candle which is lit for a rich man and profits those who are with him no less than the rich man himself, and perhaps even more, if they have keener sight. They also gave the instance of a lesson which profits the person to whom it is given no more than others who listen with him, but perhaps profits these others more, if they be more intelligent. And if it were pointed out to them that in this case the Church’s ordinance in appointing certain special prayers for certain persons is futile, they said that the Church did this to excite the devotion of the faithful, who are more inclined to offer special than common works of intercession, and pray more fervently for their kinsfolk than for strangers. Others, on the contrary, said that works of intercession avail more those for whom they are offered. Now both opinions have a certain amount of truth, for the value of intercessory works may be gauged from two sources. For their value is derived in the first place from the virtue of charity, which makes all goods common, and in this respect they avail more the person who is more full of charity, although they are not offered specially for him. In this way the value of works of intercession regards more a certain inward consolation by reason of which one who is in charity rejoices in the goods of another after death in respect of the lessening of punishment; for after death there is no possibility of obtaining or increasing grace, whereas during life the works of others avail for this purpose by the virtue of charity. In the second place intercessory works derive their value from being applied to another person by one’s intention. In this way the satisfaction of one person counts for another, and there can be no doubt that thus they avail more the person for whom they are offered; in fact, they avail him alone in this way, because satisfaction, properly speaking, is directed to the remission of punishment. Consequently, as regards the remission of punishment, works of intercession avail chiefly the person for whom they are offered, and accordingly there is more truth in the second opinion than in the first.

Reply Obj. 1. Works of intercession avail after the manner of a light in so far as they reach the dead, who thereby receive a certain amount of consolation, and this is all the greater according as they are endowed with a greater charity. But in so far as intercessory works are a satisfaction applied to another by the intention of the offerer, they do not resemble a light, but rather the payment of a debt; and it does not follow, if one person’s debt be paid, that the debt of others is paid likewise.

Reply Obj. 2. Such a merit is conditional, for in this way they merited that works of intercession would profit them if offered for them, and this was merely to render themselves fit recipients of those works of intercession. It is therefore clear that they did not directly merit the assistance of those prayers of intercession, but made themselves fit by their preceding merits to receive the fruit of intercessory works. Hence it does not follow that their merit is rendered unavailing.

Reply Obj. 3. Nothing hinders the rich from being in some respects better off than the poor, for instance as regards the expiation of their punishment. But this is as nothing in comparison with the kingdom of heaven, where the poor are shown to be better off by the authority quoted.

### Article 13. Whether Works of Intercession Offered for Several Are of As Much Value to Each One As If They Had Been Offered For Each in Particular?

We proceed thus to the Thirteenth Article: It would seem that works of intercession offered for several are of as much value to each one as if they had been offered for each in particular.

Objection 1. For it is clear that if one person receives a lesson he loses nothing if others receive the lesson with him. Therefore in like manner a person for whom a work of intercession is offered loses nothing if someone else is reckoned together with him; and consequently if it be offered for several, it is of as much value to each one as if it were offered for each in particular.

Obj. 2. Further, It is to be observed that according to the common practice of the Church, when Mass is said for one deceased person, other prayers are added for other deceased persons. Now this would not be done if the dead person for whom the Mass is said were to lose something thereby. Therefore the same conclusion follows as above.

Obj. 3. Further, Intercessions, especially of prayers, rely on the Divine power. But with God, just as it makes no difference whether He helps by means of many or by means of a few, so it differs not whether He assists many or a few. Therefore if the one same prayer be said for many, each one of them will receive as much assistance as one person would if that same prayer were said for him alone.

On the contrary, It is better to assist many than one. If therefore a work of intercession offered for several is of as much value to each one as if it were offered for one alone, it would seem that the Church ought not to have appointed a Mass and prayer to be said for one person in particular, but that Mass ought always to be said for all the faithful departed, and this is evidently false.

Further, A work of intercession has a finite efficiency. Therefore if it be divided among many it avails less for each one than if it were offered for one only.

I answer that, If the value of intercessory works be considered according as it is derived from the virtue of charity uniting the members of the Church together, intercessory works offered for several persons avail each one as much as if they were offered for one alone, because charity is not diminished if its effect be divided among many, in fact, rather is it increased; and in like manner joy increases through being shared by many, as Augustine says.1 Consequently many in purgatory rejoice in one good deed no less than one does. On the other hand, if we consider the value of works of intercession, in so far as they are a kind of satisfaction applied to the dead by the intention of the person offering them, then the prayer of intercession for some person in particular avails him more than that which is offered for him in common with many others; for in this case the effect of the intercessory prayers is divided in virtue of Divine justice among those for whom the intercessions are offered.

Hence it is evident that this question depends on the first;2 and, moreover, it is made clear why special intercessions are appointed to be offered in the Church.

Reply Obj. 1. Intercessions considered as works of satisfaction do not profit after the manner of an action as teaching does; for teaching, like any other action, produces its effect according to the disposition of the recipient. But they profit after the manner of the payment of a debt, as stated above (Article 12, Reply to Objection 1); and so the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 2. Since intercessory works offered for one person avail others in a certain way, as stated (Article 12), it follows that when Mass is said for one person, it is not unfitting for prayers to be said for others also. For these prayers are said, not that the satisfaction offered by one intercession be applied to those others chiefly, but that the prayer offered for them in particular may profit them also.

Reply Obj. 3. Prayers may be considered both on the part of the one who prays, and on the part of the person prayed, and its effect depends on both. Consequently though it is no more difficult to the Divine power to absolve many than to absolve one, nevertheless the prayer of one who prays thus is not as satisfactory for many as for one.

### Article 14. Whether General Works of Intercession Avail Those for Whom Special Works of Intercession Are Not Offered, As Much As Special Works of Intercession Avail Those For Whom They Are Offered in Addition to General Works of Intercession?

We proceed thus to the Fourteenth Article: It would seem that general works of intercession avail those for whom special works of intercession are not offered, as much as special works of intercession avail those for whom they are offered in addition to general works of intercession.

Objection 1. For in the life to come each one will be rewarded according to his merits. Now a person for whom no works of intercession are offered merited to be assisted after death as much as one for whom special works of intercession are offered. Therefore the former will be assisted by general works of intercession as much as the latter by special and general works of intercession.

Obj. 3. Further, The Eucharist is the chief of the works of intercession of the Church. Now the Eucharist, since it contains Christ whole, has infinite efficacy so to speak. Therefore one offering of the Eucharist for all in general is of sufficient value to release all who are in purgatory, and consequently general works of intercession alone afford as much assistance as special and general works of intercession together.

On the contrary, Two goods are more eligible than one. Therefore special works of intercession, together with general works of intercession, are more profitable to the person for whom they are offered than general works of intercession alone.

I answer that, The reply to this question depends on that which is given to the twelfth inquiry (Article 12), for if the works of intercession offered for one person in particular avail indifferently for all, then all works of intercession are common; and consequently one for whom the special works of intercession are not offered will be assisted as much as the one for whom they are offered, if he be equally worthy. On the other hand, if the works of intercession offered for a person do not profit all indifferently, but those chiefly for whom they are offered, then there is no doubt that general and special works of intercession together avail a person more than general works of intercession alone. Hence the Master, in the text (IV *Sentences*, distinction 45),1 mentions two opinions: one, when he says that a rich man derives from general, together with special works of intercession, an equal profit to that which a poor man derives from special works of intercession alone, for although the one receives assistance from more sources than the other, he does not receive a greater assistance; the other opinion he mentions when he says that a person for whom special works of intercession are offered obtains a more speedy but not a more complete release, because each will be finally released from all punishment.

Reply Obj. 1. The assistance derived from works of intercession is not directly and absolutely an object of merit, but conditionally as it were; hence the argument does not prove.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the power of Christ Who is contained in the Sacrament of the Eucharist is infinite, yet there is a definite effect to which that sacrament is directed. Hence it does not follow that the whole punishment of those who are in purgatory is expiated by one sacrifice of the altar; even so, by the one sacrifice which a man offers, he is not released from the whole satisfaction due for his sins, and therefore sometimes several Masses are enjoined in satisfaction for one sin. Nevertheless, if anything from special works of intercession are left over for those for whom they are offered (for instance, if they do not need them) we may well believe that by God’s mercy this is granted to others for whom those works of intercession are not offered, if they need them, as affirmed by Damascene (*Serm. de Dormitione*)2 who says: “Truly God, since He is just, will adapt ability to the disabled, and will arrange for an exchange of deficiencies”; and this exchange is effected when what is lacking to one is supplied by another.

## QUESTION 72
### Of Prayers with Regard to the Saints in Heaven
(In Three Articles)

We must now consider prayer with regard to the saints in heaven. Under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether the saints have knowledge of our prayers? (2) Whether we should beseech them to pray for us? (3) Whether the prayers they pour forth for us are always granted?

### Article 1. Whether the Saints Have Knowledge of Our Prayers?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the saints have no knowledge of our prayers.

Objection 1. For a gloss on Isaiah 63:16, *Thou art our father and Abraham hath not known us, and Israel hath been ignorant of us*, says3 that “the dead saints know not what the living, even their own children, are doing.” This is taken from Augustine (*De Cura pro Mortuis*, XIII),4 where he quotes the above authority, and the following are his words: “If such great men as the patriarchs knew not what was happening to the people begotten of them, how can the dead occupy themselves in watching and helping the affairs and actions of the living?” Therefore the saints cannot know our prayers.

Obj. 2. Further, the following words are addressed to King Joas (4 Kings 22:20): *Therefore (that is, because thou hast wept before Me), I will gather thee to thy fathers . . . that thy eyes may not see all the evils which I will bring upon this place*. But Joas would have gained no such advantage from his death if he were to know after death what was happening to his people. Therefore the saints after death do not know our actions, and thus they do not understand our prayers.

Obj. 3. Further, The more perfect a man is in charity, the more he succours his neighbour when the latter is in danger. Now the saints, in this life, watch over their neighbour, especially their kinsfolk, when these are in danger, and manifestly assist them. Since then, after death, their charity is much greater, if they were aware of our deeds, much more would they watch over their friends and kindred and assist them in their needs; and yet, it seems, they do not. Therefore it would seem that our deeds and prayers are not known to them.

Obj. 4. Further, Even as the saints after death see the Word, so do the angels of whom it is stated (Matthew 18:10) that *their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father*. Yet the angels through seeing the Word do not therefore know all things, since the lower angels are cleansed from their lack of knowledge by the higher angels, as Dionysius declares (*Celestial Hierarchy*, VII).1 Therefore although the saints see the Word, they do not see therein our prayers and other things that happen in our regard.

Obj. 5. Further, God alone is the searcher of hearts. Now prayer is seated chiefly in the heart. Therefore it belongs to God alone to know our prayers. Therefore our prayers are unknown to the saints.

On the contrary, Gregory, commenting on Job 14:21, *Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand*, says (*Moralia*, XII, 21):2 “This does not apply to the souls of the saints, for since they have an insight of Almighty God’s glory we must in no way believe that anything outside that glory is unknown to them.” Therefore they know our prayers.

Further, Gregory says (*Dialogues*, II, 35):3 “All creatures are little to the soul that sees God, because however little it sees of the Creator’s light, every created thing appears of little account to it.” Now apparently the chief obstacle to the souls of the saints knowing our prayers

and other happenings in our regard is that they are far removed from us. Since then distance does not prevent these things, as appears from the authority quoted, it would seem that the souls of the saints know our prayers and what happens here below.

Further, Unless they were aware of what happens in our regard they would not pray for us, since they would be ignorant of our needs. But this is the error of Vigilantius, as Jerome asserts in his letter against him.1 Therefore the saints know what happens in our regard.

I answer that, The Divine essence is a sufficient medium for knowing all things, and this is evident from the fact that God, by seeing His essence, sees all things. But it does not follow that whoever sees God’s essence knows all things, but only those who comprehend the essence of God; even as the knowledge of a principle does not involve the knowledge of all that follows from that principle, unless the whole force of the principle is comprehended. Therefore, since the souls of the saints do not comprehend the Divine essence, it does not follow that they know all that can be known by the Divine essence,— for which reason the lower angels are taught concerning certain matters by the higher angels, though they all see the essence of God; but each of the blessed must see in the Divine essence as many other things as the perfection of his happiness requires. For the perfection of a man’s happiness requires him to have whatever he will, and to will nothing out of order, and each one wills with a right will to know what concerns himself. Hence since no rectitude is lacking to the saints, they wish to know what concerns themselves, and consequently it follows that they know it in the Word. Now it pertains to their glory that they assist the needy for their salvation, for thus they become God’s co-operators, “than which nothing is more Godlike,” as Dionysius declares (*Cael. Hier.* III).2 And so it is evident that the saints know such things as are required for this purpose; and thus it is manifest that they know in the Word the vows, devotions, and prayers of those who have recourse to their assistance.

Reply Obj. 1. The saying of Augustine is to be understood as referring to the natural knowledge of separated souls, which knowledge is devoid of obscurity in holy men. But he is not speaking of their knowledge in the Word, for it is clear that when Isaias said this, Abraham had no such knowledge, since no one had come to the vision of God before the Redemption.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the saints, after this life, know what happens here below, we must not believe that they grieve through knowing the woes of those whom they loved in this world, for they are so filled with heavenly joy that sorrow finds no place in them. Therefore if after death they know the woes of their friends, their grief is forestalled by their removal from this world before their woes occur. Perhaps, however, the non-glorified souls would grieve somewhat, if they were aware of the distress of their dear ones, and since the soul of Josias was not glorified as soon as it went out from his body,3 it is in this respect that Augustine4 uses this argument to show that the

## SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 72 ART. 2

souls of the dead have no knowledge of the deeds of the living.

Reply Obj. 3. The souls of the saints have their will fully conformed to the Divine will even as regards the things willed; and consequently, although they retain the love of charity towards their neighbour, they do not succour him otherwise than they see to be in conformity with the disposition of Divine justice. Nevertheless, it is to be believed that they help their neighbour very much by interceding for him to God.

Reply Obj. 4. Although it does not follow that those who see the Word see all things in the Word, they see those things that pertain to the perfection of their happiness, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 5. God alone of Himself knows the thoughts of the heart; yet others know them in so far as these are revealed to them, either by their vision of the Word or by any other means.

### Article 2. Whether We Ought To Call Upon the Saints To Pray For Us?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that we ought not to call upon the saints to pray for us.

Objection 1. For no man asks anyone’s friends to pray for him, except in so far as he believes he will more easily find favour with them. But God is infinitely more merciful than any saint, and consequently His will is more easily inclined to give us a gracious hearing than the will of a saint. Therefore it would seem unnecessary to make the saints mediators between us and God, that they may intercede for us.

Obj. 2. Further, If we ought to beseech them to pray for us, this is only because we know their prayers to be acceptable to God. Now among the saints the holier a man is, the more is his prayer acceptable to God. Therefore we ought always to beseech the greater saints to intercede for us with God, and never the lesser ones.

Obj. 3. Further, Christ, even as man, is called the Holy of Holies (Dan. 9. 24), and, as man, is able to pray. Yet we never call upon Christ to pray for us. Therefore neither should we ask the other saints to do so.

Obj. 4. Further, Whenever one person intercedes for another at the latter’s request, he presents his petition to the one with whom he intercedes for him. Now it is unnecessary to present anything to one to whom all things are present. Therefore it is unnecessary to make the saints our intercessors with God.

Obj. 5. Further, It is unnecessary to do a thing if, without doing it, the purpose for which it is done would be achieved in the same way, or else not achieved at all. Now the saints would pray for us just the same, or would not pray for us at all, whether we pray to them or not; for if we be worthy of their prayers, they would pray for us even though we did not pray to them, while if we are unworthy they do not pray for us even though we ask them to. Therefore it seems altogether unnecessary to call on them to pray for us.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 5. 1):
> Call . . . if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.
Now, as Gregory says (*Moral.* V, 43)5 on this passage, “we call upon God when we beseech Him in humble prayer.” Therefore when we wish to pray God, we should turn to the saints, that they may pray God for us.

Further, The saints who are in heaven are more acceptable to God than those who are on the way. Now we should make the saints, who are on the way, our intercessors with God, after the example of the Apostle, who said (Rom. 15. 30):
> I beseech you . . . brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God.
Much more, therefore, should we ask the saints who are in heaven to help us by their prayers to God.

Further, An additional argument is provided by the common custom of the Church which asks for the prayers of the saints in the Litany.

I answer that, According to Dionysius (*Eccl. Hier.* V)6 the order established by God among things is that “the last should be led to God by those that are midway between.” Therefore, since the saints who are in heaven are nearest to God, the order of the Divine law requires that we, who while we remain in the body are pilgrims from the Lord, should be brought back to God by the saints who are between us and Him, and this happens when the Divine goodness pours forth its effect into us through them. And since our return to God should correspond to the outflow of His goodness upon us, just as the Divine favours reach us by means of the saints’ intercession, so should we, by their means, be brought back to God, that we may receive His favours again. Hence it is that we make them our intercessors with God, and our mediators as it were, when we ask them to pray for us.

Reply Obj. 1. It is not on account of any defect in God’s power that He works by means of second causes, but it is for the perfection of the order of the universe, and the more manifold outpouring of His goodness on things, through His bestowing on them not only the goodness which is proper to them, but also that they are the cause of goodness in others. Even so it is not through any defect in His mercy that we need to beseech His clemency through the prayers of the saints, but to the end that the above mentioned order in things be observed.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the greater saints are more acceptable to God than the lesser, it is sometimes profitable to pray to the lesser, and this for five reasons. First, because sometimes one has greater devotion for a lesser saint than for a greater, and the effect of prayer depends very much on one’s devotion. Secondly, in order to avoid tediousness, for continual attention to one thing makes a person weary, while by praying to different saints, the fervour of our devotion is aroused anew as it were. Thirdly, because it is granted to some saints to exercise their patronage in certain special cases, for instance to Saint Anthony against the fire of hell.7 Fourthly, that due honour be given by us to all. Fifthly, because the prayers of several sometimes obtain that which would not have been obtained by the prayers of one.

Reply Obj. 3. Prayer is an act, and acts belong to particular persons (*supposita*). Hence, were we to say: “Christ, pray for us,” unless we added something this would seem to refer to Christ’s person, and consequently to agree with the error either of Nestorius,8 who distinguished in Christ the person of the son of man from the person of the Son of God, or of Arius,9 who asserted that the person of the Son is less than the Father. Therefore to avoid these errors the Church says not: “Christ, pray for us,” but “Christ, hear us,” or “have mercy on us.”

Reply Obj. 4. As we shall state further on (a. 3) the saints are said to present our prayers to God not as though they manifest things unknown to Him, but because they ask God to grant those prayers a gracious hearing, or because they seek the Divine truth about them, namely what ought to be done according to His providence.

Reply Obj. 5. A person is rendered worthy of a saint’s prayers for him by the very fact that in his need he has recourse to him with pure devotion. Hence it is not unnecessary to pray to the saints.

### Article 3. Whether the Prayers Which the Saints Pour Forth To God for Us Are Always Granted?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the prayers which the saints pour forth to God for us are not always granted.

Objection 1. For if they were always granted, the saints would be heard especially in regard to matters concerning themselves. But they are not heard in reference to these things; hence it is stated in the Apocalypse (6. 11) that on the martyrs beseeching vengeance on them that dwell on earth, it was said to them that they should rest for a little while till the number of their brethren should be filled up (Vulg.,— till their fellow-servants and their brethren . . . should be filled up). Much less, therefore, are they heard in reference to matters concerning others.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (Jer. 15. 1):
> If Moses and Samuel shall stand before Me, My soul is not towards this people.
Therefore, the saints are not always heard when they pray God for us.

Obj. 3. Further, The saints in heaven are stated to be equal to the angels of God (Matt. 22. 30). But the angels are not always heard in the prayers which they offer up to God. This is evident from Dan. 10. 12, 13, where it is written:
> I am come for thy words: but the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one-and-twenty days.
But the angel who spoke had not come to Daniel’s aid except by asking of God to be set free; and yet the fulfilment of his prayer was hindered. Therefore neither are other saints always heard by God when they pray for us.

Obj. 4. Further, Whosoever obtains something by prayer merits it in a sense. But the saints in heaven are not in the state of meriting. Therefore they cannot obtain anything for us from God by their prayers.

Obj. 5. Further, The saints, in all things, conform their will to the will of God. Therefore they will nothing but what they know God to will. But no one prays save for what he wills. Therefore they pray not save for what they know God to will. Now that which God wills would be done even without their praying for it. Therefore their prayers are not efficacious for obtaining anything.

Obj. 6. Further, The prayers of the whole heavenly court, if they could obtain anything, would be more efficacious than all the petitions of the Church here below. Now if the intercessory works of the Church here below for some one in purgatory were to be multiplied, he would be wholly delivered from punishment. Since then the saints in heaven pray for those who are in purgatory on the same account as for us, if they obtain anything for us, their prayers would deliver entirely from punishment those who are in purgatory. But this is not true, because then the Church’s intercessory works for the dead would be unnecessary.

On the contrary, It is written (II Machab. 15. 14):
> This is he that prayeth much for the people, and for all the holy city, Jeremias the prophet of God,
and that his prayer was granted is clear from what follows (verse 15):
> Jeremias stretched forth his right hand, and gave to Judas a sword of gold, saying: Take this holy sword, a gift from God, etc.

Further, Jerome says (*Epist. contra Vigilantium*)1:
> “Thou sayest in thy pamphlets, that while we live, we can pray for one another, but that when we are dead no one’s prayer for another will be heard”;
and afterwards he refutes this in the following words:
> “If the apostles and martyrs while yet in the body can pray for others, while they are still solicitous for themselves, how much more can they do so when the crown, the victory, the triumph is already theirs!”

Further, This is confirmed by the custom of the Church, which often asks to be assisted by the prayers of the saints.

I answer that, The saints are said to pray for us in two ways. First, by “express” prayer, when by their prayers they seek a hearing of the Divine clemency on our behalf; secondly, by “interpretive” prayer, namely by their merits which, being known to God, avail not only them to glory, but also us as intercessions and prayers, even as the shedding of Christ’s blood is said to ask pardon for us (Heb. 12. 24). In both ways the saints’ prayers considered in themselves avail to obtain what they ask, yet on our part they may fail so that we obtain not the fruit of their prayers, in so far as they are said to pray for us by reason of their merits availing on our behalf. But in so far as they pray for us by asking something for us in their prayers, their prayers are always granted, since they will only what God wills, nor do they ask save for what they will to be done; and what God wills is always fulfilled,— unless we speak of His antecedent will, whereby He wills all men to be saved. For this will is not always fulfilled; and therefore it is no wonder if that also which the saints will according to this kind of will is not fulfilled sometimes.

Reply Obj. 1. This prayer of the martyrs is merely their desire to obtain the robe of the body and the fellowship of those who will be saved, and their consent to God’s justice in punishing the wicked. Hence a gloss on Apoc. 6. 11, *How long, O Lord*, says:10 “They desire an increase of joy and the fellowship of the saints, and they consent to God’s justice.”

Reply Obj. 2. The Lord speaks there of Moses and Samuel according to their state in this life. For we read that they withstood God’s anger by praying for the people.11 And yet even if they had been living at the time in question, they would have been unable to placate God towards the people by their prayers, on account of the wickedness of this same people; and it is thus that we are to understand this passage.

Reply Obj. 3. This dispute among the good angels does not mean that they offered contradictory prayers to God, but that they submitted contrary merits on various sides to the Divine inquiry, with a view of God’s pronouncing sentence thereon. This, in fact, is what Gregory says (*Moral.* XVII, 12)12 in explanation of the aforesaid words of Daniel:
> “The lofty spirits that are set over the nations never fight in behalf of those that act unjustly, but they justly judge and try their deeds. And when the guilt, or innocence of any particular nation is brought into the debate of the court above, the ruling spirit of that nation is said to have won or lost in the conflict. Yet the supreme will of their Maker is victorious over all, for since they have it ever before their eyes, they will not what they are unable to obtain,”
and therefore neither do they seek for it. And consequently it is clear that their prayers are always heard.

Reply Obj. 4. Although the saints are not in a state to merit for themselves, when once they are in heaven, they are in a state to merit for others, or rather to assist others by reason of their previous merit, for while living they merited that their prayers should be heard after their death.

Or we may reply that prayer is meritorious on one count, and petitionary on another. For merit consists in a certain squaring of the act to the end for which it is intended, and which is given to it as its reward, while the petition of a prayer depends on the liberality of the person supplicated. Hence prayer sometimes, through the liberality of the person supplicated, obtains that which was not merited either by the suppliant, or by the person supplicated for; and so, although the saints are not in the state of meriting, it does not follow that they are not in the state of being able to petition.

Reply Obj. 5. As appears from the authority of Gregory quoted above (Reply 3), the saints and angels will nothing but what they see to be in the Divine will, and so neither do they pray for anything else. Nor is their prayer fruitless, since as Augustine says,13 the prayers of the saints profit the predestined, because it is perhaps preordained that they shall be saved through the prayers of those who intercede for them; and consequently God also wills that what the saints see Him to will shall be fulfilled through their prayers.

Reply Obj. 6. The intercessory works of the Church for the dead are as so many satisfactions of the living in lieu of the dead, and accordingly they free the dead from the punishment which the latter have not paid. But the saints in heaven are not in the state of making satisfaction; and consequently the parallel fails between their prayers and the intercessory works of the Church.

## QUESTION LXXIII

Of the signs that will precede THE JUDGMENT (*In Three Articles*)

We must next consider the signs that will precede the judgment, and under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether any signs will precede the Lord’s coming to judgment? (2) Whether in very truth the sun and moon will be darkened? (3) Whether the powers of the heavens will be moved when the Lord shall come?

### Article 1. Whether Any Signs Will Precede the Lord's Coming to Judgment?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the Lord’s coming to judgment will not be preceded by any signs.

Objection 1. Because it is written (I Thess. 5. 3):
> When they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them.
Now there would be no peace and security if men were terrified by previous signs. Therefore signs will not precede that coming.

Obj. 2. Further, Signs are required for the manifestation of something. But His coming is to be hidden; hence it is written (I Thess. 5. 2):
> The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night.
Therefore signs ought not to precede it.

Obj. 3. Further, The time of His first coming was foreknown by the prophets,14 which does not apply to His second coming.15 Now no such signs preceded the first coming of Christ. Therefore neither will they precede the second.

On the contrary, It is written (Luke 21. 25):
> There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, etc.

Further, Jerome mentions fifteen signs preceding the judgment.16 He says that on the first day all the seas will rise fifteen cubits above the mountains; in the second day all the waters will be plunged into the depths, so that scarcely will they be visible; on the third day they will be restored to their previous condition; on the fourth day all the great fishes and other things that move in the waters will gather together and, raising their heads above the sea, roar at one another contentiously; on the fifth day, all the birds of the air will gather together in the fields, wailing to one another, with neither bite nor sup; on the sixth day rivers of fire will arise towards the firmament rushing together from the west to the east; on the seventh day all the stars, both planets and fixed stars, will throw out fiery tails like comets; on the eighth day there will be a great earthquake, and all animals will be laid low; on the ninth day all the plants will be bedewed as it were with blood; on the tenth day all stones, little and great, will be divided into four parts dashing against one another; on the eleventh day all hills and mountains and buildings will be reduced to dust; on the twelfth day all animals will come from forest and mountain to the fields, roaring and tasting of nothing; on the thirteenth day all graves from east to west will open to allow the bodies to rise again; on the fourteenth day all men will leave their abode, neither understanding nor speaking, but rushing hither and thither like madmen; on the fifteenth day all will die and will rise again with those who died long before.

I answer that, When Christ shall come to judge He will appear in the form of glory, on account of the authority which is due to a judge. Now it pertains to the dignity of judicial power to have certain signs that induce people to reverence and subjection, and consequently many signs will precede the advent of Christ when He shall come to judgment, in order that the hearts of men be brought to subjection to the coming judge, and be prepared for the judgment, being forewarned by those signs.

But it is not easy to know what these signs may be, for the signs of which we read in the gospels,17 as Augustine says, writing to Hesychius about the end of the world,18 refer not only to Christ’s coming to judgment, but also to the time of the sack of Jerusalem, and to the coming of Christ in ceaselessly visiting His Church. So that, perhaps, if we consider them carefully, we shall find that none of them refers to the coming advent, as he remarks,19 because these signs that are mentioned in the gospels, such as wars, fears, and so forth, have been from the beginning of the human race; unless perhaps we say that at that time they will be more prevalent, although it is uncertain in what degree this increase will foretell the imminence of the advent.

The signs mentioned by Jerome are not asserted by him; he merely says that he found them written in the annals of the Hebrews,20 and, indeed, they contain very little likelihood.

Reply Obj. 1. According to Augustine19 towards the end of the world there will be a general persecution of the good by the wicked, so that at the same time some will fear, namely the good, and some will be secure, namely the wicked. The words:
> When they shall say: Peace and security,
refer to the wicked, who will pay little heed to the signs of the coming judgment, while the words of Luke 21. 26, *men withering away*, etc., should be referred to the good.

We may also reply that all these signs that will happen about the time of the judgment are considered to occur within the time occupied by the judgment, so that the judgment day contains them all. Therefore although men be terrified by the signs appearing about the judgment day, yet before those signs begin to appear the wicked will think themselves to be in peace and security, after the death of Antichrist and before the coming of Christ, seeing that the world is not at once destroyed, as they first thought.

Reply Obj. 2. The day of the Lord is said to come as a thief, because the exact time is not known, since it will not be possible to know it from those signs; although, as we have already said (Reply 1), all these most manifest signs which will precede the judgment immediately may be comprised under the judgment day.

Reply Obj. 3. At His first advent Christ came secretly, although the appointed time was known beforehand by the prophets. Hence there was no need for such signs to appear at His first coming, as will appear at His second advent, when He will come openly, although the appointed time is hidden.

### Article 2. Whether Towards the Time of the Judgment the Sun and Moon Will Be Darkened in Very Truth?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that towards the time of the judgment the sun and moon will be darkened in very truth.

Objection 1. For, as Rabanus says,21 commenting on Matt. 24. 29,
> “Nothing hinders us from gathering that the sun, moon, and stars will then be deprived of their light, as we know happened to the sun at the time of our Lord’s passion.”

Obj. 2. Further, The light of the heavenly

# Supplement

bodies are directed to the generation of inferior
bodies, because by its means and not only by
their movement they act upon this lower world,
as Averroes says (*De Subst. Orbis*).7 But gen-
eration will cease then. Therefore neither will
light remain in the heavenly bodies.

Obj. 3. Further, According to some the in-
ferior bodies will be cleansed of the qualities
by which they act. Now heavenly bodies act
not only by movement, but also by light, as
stated above (obj. 2). Therefore as the move-
ment of heaven will cease, so will the light of
the heavenly bodies.

On the contrary, According to astronomers
the sun and moon cannot be eclipsed at the
same time. But this darkening of the sun and
moon is stated to be simultaneous, when the
Lord shall come to judgment. Therefore the
darkening will not be in very truth due to a
natural eclipse.

6 Cf. Bede, *In Marc.*, Bk. IV (PL 92, 263).
7 Averroes, *De Subst. Orbis.*, Chap. 2 (ix, 8A); cf. *In De Caelo*, Bk. II, Comm. 42 (v, 126K).

## SUMMA THEOLOGICA

Further, It is not appropriate for the same
thing to be the cause of a thing’s failing and
increasing. Now when our Lord shall come the
light of the luminaries will increase according
to Isa. 30. 26,
> "The light of the moon shall be
> as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun
> shall be sevenfold."
Therefore it is unfitting for
the light of these bodies to cease when our
Lord comes.

I answer that, If we speak of the sun and
moon in respect of the very moment of Christ’s
coming, it is not credible that they will be dark-
ened through being bereft of their light, since
when Christ comes and the saints rise again the
whole world will be renewed, as we shall state
further on, as we have said.1 If, however, we
speak of them in respect of the time immedi-
ately preceding the judgment, it is possible that
by the Divine power the sun, moon, and other
luminaries of the heavens will be darkened,
either at various times or all together, in order
to inspire men with fear.

Reply Obj. 1. Rabanus is speaking of the
time preceding the judgment; therefore he adds
that when the judgment day is over the words
of Isaias shall be fulfilled.

Reply Obj. 2. Light is in the heavenly bodies
not only for the purpose of causing generation
in these lower bodies, but also for their own
perfection and beauty. Hence it does not fol-
low that where generation ceases the light of the
heavenly bodies will cease, but rather that it
will increase.

Reply Obj. 3. It does not seem probable that
the elemental qualities will be removed from
the elements, although some have asserted this.
If, however, they are removed, there would still
be no parallel between them and light, since the
elemental qualities are in opposition to one an-
other, so that their action is corruptive, while
light is a principle of action not by way of op-
position, but by way of a principle regulating
things in opposition to one another and bring-
ing them back to harmony. Nor is there a
parallel with the movement of heavenly bodies,
for movement is the act of that which is im-
perfect, and therefore it must cease when the
imperfection ceases; this, however, cannot be
said of light.

### Article 3. Whether the Virtues of Heaven Will Be Moved When Our Lord Shall Come?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It
would seem that the virtues of heaven will not
be moved when our Lord shall come.

1 *In Sent.*, iv, d. xlvii, q. 2, a. 3; cf. below, q. lxxiv, a. 7.

Objection 1. For the virtues of heaven can
denote only the blessed angels.2 Now immu-
tability is essential to blessedness. Therefore
it will be impossible for them to be moved.

Obj. 2. Further, Ignorance is the cause of
wonder.3 Now ignorance, like fear, is far from
the angels, for as Gregory says (*Dial.*, iv, 33),4
> “what do they not see, who see Him Who sees
> all.”
Therefore it will be impossible for them
to be moved with wonder, as stated in the text
(*iv Sent.*, d. 48).5

Obj. 3. Further, All the angels will be pres-
ent at the Divine judgment; therefore it is
stated (Apoc. 7. 11): "All the angels stood round
about the throne." Now the virtues denote one
particular order of angels. Therefore it should
not be said of them rather than of others, that
they are moved.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 26. 11):
"The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at His
beck." Now the pillars of heaven can denote
only the virtues of heaven. Therefore the vir-
tues of heaven will be moved.

Further, It is written (Matt. 24. 29): "The
stars shall fall from heaven, and the virtues
(Douay,—powers) of heaven shall be moved."

I answer that, Virtue is twofold as applied
to the angels, as Dionysius states (*Coel. Hier.*,
xi).6 For sometimes the name of “virtues” is
appropriated to one order, which according to
him, is the middle order of the middle hier-
archy, but according to Gregory (*Hom. in Ev.*,
xxxiv)7 is the highest order of the lowest hier-
archy. In another sense it is employed to de-
note all the heavenly spirits in general. In the
question at issue it may be taken either way.
For in the text (*loc. cit.*) it is explained accord-
ing to the second acceptation, so as to denote all
the angels, and then they are said to be moved
through wonder at the renewing of the world,
as stated in the text.

It can also be explained in reference to vir-
tue as the name of a particular order, and then
that order is said to be moved more than the
others by reason of the effect, since according
to Gregory (*loc. cit.*) we ascribe to that order
the working of miracles which especially will
be worked about that time; or again, because
that order—since, according to Dionysius (*loc.
cit.*), it belongs to the middle hierarchy—is not
limited in its power, and therefore its ministry
must regard universal causes. Consequently
the proper office of the virtues seems to be to
move the heavenly bodies which are the cause
of what happens in nature here below. And
again the very name denotes this, since they
are called the virtues of heaven (Matt. 24.
29). Accordingly they will be moved then, be-
cause they will no more produce their effect,
by ceasing to move the heavenly bodies, even
as the angels who are appointed to watch
over men will no longer fulfill the office of
guardians.

6 Dionysius, *Coel. Hier.*, xi, sect. 1 (PG 3, 284).
7 Gregory, *Hom. in Ev.*, xxxiv (PL 76, 125a).

Reply Obj. 1. This change alters nothing per-
taining to their state, but refers either to their
effects which may vary without any change on
their part, or to some new consideration of
things which hitherto they were unable to see
by means of their concreated species, which
change of thought is not taken from them by
their state of blessedness. Hence Augustine
says:1
> “God moves the spiritual creature
> through time.”

Reply Obj. 2. Wonder is usually about things
surpassing our condition or power, and accord-
ingly the virtues of heaven will wonder at the
Divine power doing such things, in so far as
they fail to do or comprehend them. In this
sense the blessed Agnes said that
> “the sun and
> moon wonder at His beauty,”2
and this does
not imply ignorance in the angels, but removes
the comprehension of God from them.

The Reply to the Third Objection is clear
from what has been said.

## QUESTION LXXIV

### Of the Fire of the Final Conflagration
(In Nine Articles)

We must now consider the fire of the final con-
flagration, and under this head there are nine
points of inquiry:

### Article 1. Whether the World Is To Be Cleansed?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It
would seem that there is not to be any cleansing
of the world.

Objection 1. For only that which is unclean
needs cleansing. Now God’s creatures are not
unclean, and therefore it is written (Acts 10.
15):
> "That which God hath cleansed, do not
> thou call common,"
that is, unclean. Therefore
the creatures of the world shall not be cleansed.

Obj. 2. Further, According to Divine justice
cleansing is directed to the removal of the un-
cleanness of sin, as instanced in the cleansing
after death. But there can be no stain of sin
in the elements of this world. Therefore, it
seems, they do not need to be cleansed.

Obj. 3. Further, A thing is said to be cleansed
when anything extraneous that depreciates it is
removed from it, for the removal of that which
ennobles a thing is not called a cleansing, but
rather a diminishing. Now it pertains to the
perfection and nobility of the elements that
something of a foreign nature is mingled with
them, since the form of a mixed body is more
noble than the form of a simple body. There-
fore it would seem in no way fitting that the
elements of this world can possibly be cleansed.

On the contrary, All renewal is effected by
some kind of cleansing. But the elements will
be renewed; hence it is written (Apoc. 21. 1):
> "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the
> first heaven and the first earth was gone."
Therefore the elements shall be cleansed.

Further, a gloss on I Cor. 7. 31, "The fashion of
this earth passeth away," says:3
> “The beauty of
> this world will perish in the burning of worldly
> flames.”
Therefore the same conclusion follows.

I answer that, Since the world was, in a way,
made for man’s sake, it follows that when man
shall be glorified in the body, the other bodies
of the world shall also be changed to a better
state, so that it is rendered a more fitting place
for him and more pleasant to look upon. Now
in order that man obtain the glory of the body,
it is necessary first of all those things to be re-
moved which are opposed to glory. There are
two, namely the corruption and stain of sin,—
because according to I Cor. 15. 50, "neither shall
corruption possess incorruption;" and "all the
unclean shall be without the city of glory"
(Apoc. 22. 15);4 and again, the elements re-
quire to be cleansed from the contrary disposi-
tions before they are brought to the newness
of glory, proportionately to what we have said
with regard to man. Now although, properly
speaking, a corporeal thing cannot be the sub-
ject of the stain of sin, nevertheless, on account
of sin corporeal things contract a certain un-
fittingness for being appointed to spiritual pur-
poses; and for this reason we find that places
where crimes have been committed are consid-
ered unfit for the performance of sacred actions
therein, unless they are cleansed beforehand.
Accordingly that part of the world which is
given to our use contracts from men’s sins a
certain unfitness for being glorified, and there-
fore in this respect it needs to be cleansed. In
like manner with regard to the intervening
space, on account of the contact of the ele-
ments, there are many corruptions, generations
and alterations of the elements, which dimin-
ish their purity: therefore the elements need
to be cleansed from these also, so that they be
fit to receive the newness of glory.

3 *Glossa Lombardi* (PL 191, 1597); cf. *Glossa ordin.* (vi, 44A); Augustine, *City of God*, XX, 16 (PL 41, 682).
4 Cf. Apoc. 21. 27.

Reply Obj. 1. When it is asserted that every
creature of God is clean we are to understand
this as meaning that its substance contains no
alloy of evil, as the Manichees maintained,1
saying that evil and good are two substances in
some places severed from one another, in others
mingled together. But it does not exclude a
creature from having an admixture of a foreign
nature, which in itself is also good, but is in-
consistent with the perfection of that creature.
Nor does this prevent evil from being acci-
dental to a creature, although not mingled with
it as part of its substance.

Reply Obj. 2. Although corporeal elements
cannot be the subject of sin, nevertheless, from
the sin that is committed in them they contract
a certain unfitness for receiving the perfection
of glory.

Reply Obj. 3. The form of a mixed body and
the form of an element may be considered in
two ways: either as regards the perfection of
the species, and thus a mixed body is more per-
fect; or as regards their continual endurance,
and thus the simple body is more noble, because
it has not in itself the cause of corruption, un-
less it be corrupted by something extrinsic,
whereas a mixed body has in itself the cause of
its corruption, namely the composition of con-
traries. Therefore a simple body, although it
is corruptible in part is incorruptible as a
whole, which cannot be said of a mixed body.
And since incorruption belongs to the perfec-
tion of glory, it follows that the perfection of
a simple body is more in keeping with the per-
fection of glory than the perfection of a mixed
body, unless the mixed body has also in itself
some principle of incorruption, as the human
body has, the form of which is incorruptible.
Nevertheless, although a mixed body is some-
what more noble than a simple body, a simple
body that exists by itself has a more noble be-
ing than if it exist in a mixed body, because in
a mixed body simple bodies are in a certain
way in potency, while existing by themselves,
they are in their ultimate perfection.

### Article 2. Whether the Cleansing of the World Will Be Effected By Fire?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It
would seem that this cleansing will not be ef-
fected by fire.

Objection 1. For since fire is a part of the
world, it needs to be cleansed like the other
parts. Now the same thing should not be both
cleanser and cleansed. Therefore it would seem
that the cleansing will not be by fire.

Obj. 2. Further, Just as fire has a cleansing
virtue so has water. Since then all things are
not capable of being cleansed by fire, and some
need to be cleansed by water,—which distinc-
tion is moreover observed by the old law (Num.
31. 22),—it would seem that fire will not at
any rate cleanse all things.

Obj. 3. Further, This cleansing would seem
to consist in purifying the parts of the world
by separating them from one another. Now
the separation of the parts of the world from
one another at the world’s beginning was ef-
fected by God’s power alone, for the work of
distinction was carried out by that power; and
so Anaxagoras asserted that the separation was
effected by the act of the intellect which moves
all things.2 Therefore it would seem that at
the end of the world the cleansing will be done
immediately by God and not by fire.

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 49. 3):
> "A fire shall burn before Him, and a mighty
> tempest shall be around Him;"
and afterwards
in reference to the judgment (verse 4):
> "He
> shall call heaven from above, and the earth to
> judge His people."
Therefore it would seem that
the final cleansing of the world will be by
means of fire.

Further, It is written (II Pet. 3. 12):
> "The
> heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the
> elements shall melt with the burning heat."
Therefore this cleansing will be effected by fire.

I answer that, As stated above (a. 1) this
cleansing of the world will remove from it the
stain contracted from sin, and the impurity re-
sulting from mixture, and will be a disposition
to the perfection of glory; and consequently in
this threefold respect it will be most fitting for
it to be effected by fire. First, because since fire
is the most noble of the elements, its natural
properties are more like the properties of glory,
and this is especially clear in regard to light.
Secondly, because fire, on account of the ef-
ficacy of its active power, is not as susceptible
as the other elements to the admixture of a
foreign matter. Thirdly, because the sphere of
fire is far removed from our abode; nor are we
so familiar with the use of fire as with that of
earth, water, and air, so that it is not so liable
to depreciation. Moreover, it is most efficacious
in cleansing and in separating by a process of
rarefaction.

2 Cf. Aristotle, *Physics*, III, 4 (203a23); VIII, 9 (265a22).

Reply Obj. 1. Fire is not employed by us in
its proper matter (since thus it is far removed
from us), but only in a foreign matter, and in
this respect it will be possible for the world to
be cleansed by fire as existing in its pure state.

Reply Obj. 2. The first cleansing of the world
by the deluge regarded only the stain of sin.
Now the sin which was most prevalent then was
the sin of concupiscence, and consequently it
was fitting that the cleansing should be by
means of its contrary, namely water. But the
second cleansing regards both the stain of sin
and the impurity of mixture, and in respect of
both it is more fitting for it to be effected by
fire than by water. For the power of water
tends to unite rather than to separate; there-
fore the natural impurity of the elements could
not be removed by water as by fire. Moreover,
at the end of the world the prevalent sin will
be that of tepidity, as though the world were
already growing old, because then, according
to Matt. 24. 12, "the charity of many shall grow
cold," and consequently the cleansing will then
be fittingly effected by fire. Nor is there any-
thing that cannot in some way be cleansed by
fire; some things, however, cannot be cleansed
by fire without being destroyed themselves,
such as cloths and wooden vessels, and these
the Law ordered to be cleansed with water;
yet all these things will be finally destroyed by
fire.

Reply Obj. 3. By the work of distinction
things received different forms whereby they
are distinct from one another, and consequently
this could only be done by Him Who is the
author of nature. But by the final cleansing
things will be restored to the purity in which
they were created, and therefore created nature
will be able to minister to its Creator to this
effect; and for this reason a creature is em-
ployed as a minister, because it is thereby en-
nobled.

### Article 3. Whether the Fire By Which the World Will Be Cleansed Will Be of the Same Species With Elemental Fire?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It
would seem that the fire in question is not of
the same species as elemental fire.

Objection 1. For nothing consumes itself.
But that fire will consume the four elements
according to a gloss on II Pet. 3. 12.1 Therefore
that fire will not be of the same species as
elemental fire.

Obj. 2. Further, As power is made known by
operation, so is nature made known by power.
Now that fire will have a different power from
the fire which is an element, because it will
cleanse the universe, whereas this fire cannot
do that. Therefore it will not be of the same
species as this.

Obj. 3. Further, In natural bodies those that
are of the same species have the same movement.
But that fire will have a different movement
from the fire that is an element, because it will
move in all directions so as to cleanse the
whole. Therefore it is not of the same species.

On the contrary, Augustine says,2 and his
words are contained in a gloss3 on I Cor. 7. 31,
that
> “the fashion of this world will perish in
> the burning of worldly flames.”
Therefore that
fire will be of the same nature as the fire which
is now in the world.

Further, Just as the future cleansing is to be
by fire, so was the past cleansing by water; and
they are both compared to one another, II Pet.
3. 5. Now in the first cleansing the water was
of the same species with elemental water.
Therefore in like manner the fire of the second
cleansing will be of the same species with ele-
mental fire.

I answer that, We meet with three opinions
on this question. For some say that the element
of fire which is in its own sphere will come
down to cleanse the world, and they explain
this descent by way of multiplication, because
the fire will spread through finding combustible
matter on all sides. And this will result all the
more then, since the power of the fire will be
raised over all the elements. Against this, how-
ever, would seem to be not only the fact that
this fire will come down, but also the statement
of the saints that it will rise up; thus (II Pet.
3. 10) it is declared that
> “the fire of the judg-
> ment will rise as high as the waters of the del-
> uge”;1
and so it would seem to follow that this
fire is situated towards the middle of the place
of generation.

1 *Glossa ordin.* (vi, 227B); cf. Bede (PL 93, 82).
2 Augustine, *City of God*, XX, 16 (PL 41, 682).
3 *Glossa Lombardi* (PL 191, 1597); cf. *Glossa ordin.* (vi, 44A).

Hence others say that this fire will be gen-
erated towards the intervening space through
the focusing together of the rays of the
heavenly bodies, just as we see them focused
together in a burning-glass; for at that time in
lieu of glasses there will be concave clouds, on
which the rays will strike. But this again does
not seem probable, for since the effects of
heavenly bodies depend on certain fixed posi-
tions and aspects, if this fire resulted from the
virtue of the heavenly bodies the time of this
cleansing would be known to those who observe
the movements of the stars, and this is con-
trary to the authority of Scripture (Matt. 24.
36).

Consequently others, following Augustine,
say that
> “just as the deluge resulted from an
> outpouring of the waters of the world, so the
> fashion of this world will perish by a burning
> of worldly flames.”2
This burning is nothing else
but the assembly of all those lower and higher
causes that by their nature have a kindling
power, and this assembly will take place not in
the ordinary course of things, but by the Divine
power; and from all these causes thus assem-
bled the fire that will burn the surface of this
world will result.

If we consider these opinions in themselves,
we shall find that they differ as to the cause
producing this fire and not as to its species.
For fire, whether produced by the sun or by
some lower heating cause, is of the same species
as fire in its own sphere, except in so far as the
former has some admixture of foreign matter.
And this will of necessity be the case then, since
fire cannot cleanse a thing unless this become
its matter in some way. Hence we must grant
absolutely that the fire in question is of the
same species as ours.

Reply Obj. 1. The fire in question, although
of the same species as ours, is not numerically
the same. Now we see that of two fires of the
same species one destroys the other, namely the
greater destroys the lesser, by consuming its
matter. In like manner that fire will be able to
destroy our fire.

Reply Obj. 2. Just as an operation that pro-
ceeds from the power of a thing is an indi-
cation of that power, so is its power an indica-
tion of its essence or nature, if it proceeds
from the essential principles of the thing. But
an operation that does not proceed from the
power of the operator does not indicate its
power. This appears in instruments, for the
action of an instrument shows forth the power
of the mover rather than that of the instru-
ment, since it shows forth the power of the
agent in so far as the latter is the first principle
of the action, while it does not show forth the
power of the instrument except in so far as it is
susceptive of the influence of the principal agent
as moving that instrument. In like manner a
power that does not proceed from the essential
principles of a thing does not indicate the na-
ture of that thing except in the point of sus-
ceptibility. Thus the power by which hot water
can heat is no indication of the nature of water
except in the point of its being receptive of
heat. Consequently nothing prevents water that
has this power from being of the same species
as water that does not have it. In like manner
it is not unreasonable that this fire, which will
have the power to cleanse the surface of the
world, will be of the same species as the fire
to which we are used, since the heating power
in it arises not from its essential principles, but
from the divine power or operation, whether
we say that this power is an absolute quality,
such as heat in hot water, or a kind of intention
as we have ascribed to instrumental power.3
The latter is more probable since that fire will
not act save as the instrument of the Divine
power.

1 Cf. *Glossa interlin.* (vi, 227r); Peter Lombard, *Sent.*, iv, d. xlvii, chap. 4 (QR II, 1021).
2 Augustine, *City of God*, XX, 16 (PL 41, 682).

Reply Obj. 3. Of its own nature fire tends
only upwards; but in so far as it pursues its
matter, which it requires when it is outside its
own sphere, it follows the site of combustible
matter. Accordingly it is not unreasonable for
it to take a circular or a downward course,
especially in so far as it acts as the instrument
of the Divine power.

### Article 4. Whether That Fire Will Cleanse Also the Higher Heavens?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It
would seem that that fire will cleanse also the
higher heavens.

3 Thomas, *In Sent.*, iv, d. 1, Q. 1, A. 4.

Objection 1. For it is written (Ps. 101. 26,
27):
> "The heavens are the works of Thy hands:
> they shall perish but Thou remainest."
Now the
higher heavens also are the work of God’s
hands. Therefore they also shall perish in the
final burning of the world.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (II Pet. 3. 12):
> "The heavens being on fire shall be dissolved,
> and the elements shall melt with the burning
> heat of fire."
Now the heavens that are distinct
from the elements are the higher heavens, in
which the stars are fixed. Therefore it would
seem that they also will be cleansed by that fire.

Obj. 3. Further, The purpose of that fire
will be to remove from bodies their indispo-
sition to the perfection of glory. Now in the
higher heaven we find this indisposition both as
regards guilt, since the devil sinned there, and as
regards natural deficiency, since a gloss on Rom.
8. 22, "We know that every creature groaneth and
is in labour even until now," says:1
> “All the ele-
> ments fulfill their duty with labour, even as it is
> not without labour that the sun and moon travel
> their appointed course.”
Therefore the higher
heavens also will be cleansed by that fire.

On the contrary, The heavenly bodies are not
receptive of impressions from without.

Further, A gloss on II Thess. 1. 8, "In a flame
of fire giving vengeance," says:2
> “There will be
> in the world a fire that shall precede Him, and
> shall rise in the air to the same height as did
> the waters of the deluge.”
But the waters of the

1 Bede, *In Rom.* (PL 93, 100).
2 *Glossa interlin.* (vi, 227r); Peter Lombard, *Sent.*, iv, d. xlvii, chap. 4 (QR II, 1021).

deluge did not rise to the height of the higher heavens but only 15 cubits higher than the mountain summits (Gen. 7:20). Therefore the higher heavens will not be cleansed by that fire.

I answer that, The cleansing of the world will be for the purpose of removing from bodies the disposition contrary to the perfection of glory, and this perfection is the final consummation of the universe; and this disposition is to be found in all bodies, but differently in different bodies. For in some this indisposition regards something inherent to their substance, as in these lower bodies which by being mixed together fall away from their own purity. In others this indisposition does not regard something inherent to their substance; as in the heavenly bodies, wherein nothing is to be found contrary to the final perfection of the universe, except movement which is the way to perfection, and this not any kind of movement, but only local movement, which changes nothing intrinsic to a thing, such as its substance, quantity, or quality, but only its place, which is extrinsic to it. Consequently there is no need to take anything away from the substance of the higher heavens, but only to set its movement at rest. Now local movement is brought to rest not by the action of a counter-agent, but by the mover ceasing to move; and therefore the heavenly bodies will not be cleansed, neither by fire nor by the action of any creature, but in lieu of being cleansed they will be set at rest by God’s will alone.

Reply Obj. 1. As Augustine says, [3] those words of the psalm refer to the aerial heavens which will be cleansed by the fire of the final conflagration. Or we may reply that if they refer also to the higher heavens, these are said to perish as regards their movement whereby now they are moved without cessation.

Reply Obj. 2. Peter explains himself to which heavens he refers. For before the words quoted, he had said (verses 5-7):
> The heavens . . . first, and the earth . . . through water . . . perished . . . which . . . now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire unto the day of judgment. [4]
Therefore the heavens to be cleansed are those which before were cleansed by the waters of the deluge, namely the aerial heavens.

Reply Obj. 3. This labour and service of the creature, that Ambrose ascribes to the heavenly bodies, is nothing else than the successive movements whereby they are subject to time, and the lack of that final consummation which they will attain in the end. Nor did the empyrean heaven contract any stain from the sin of the demons, because they were expelled from that heaven as soon as they sinned (Luke 10:18; Apoc. 12:7).

## Article 5. Whether That Fire Will Consume the Other Elements?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that the fire in question will consume the other elements.

Objection 1. For a gloss of Bede on 2 Pet. 3:12 says: [5]
> This exceeding great fire will engulf the four elements whereof the world consists; yet it will not so engulf all things that they will cease to be, but it will consume two of them entirely, and will restore two of them to a better fashion.
Therefore it would seem that at least two of the elements are to be entirely destroyed by that fire.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (Apoc. 21:1):
> The first heaven and the first earth have passed away and the sea is no more.
Now the heaven here denotes the air, as Augustine states, [6] and the sea denotes the gathering together of the waters. Therefore it would seem that these three elements will be wholly destroyed.

Obj. 3. Further, Fire does not cleanse except in so far as other things are made to be its matter. If, then, fire cleanses the other elements, they must become its matter. Therefore they must pass into its nature, and consequently be voided of their own nature.

Obj. 4. Further, The form of fire is the most noble of the forms to which elemental matter can attain. Now all things will be brought to the most noble state by this cleansing. Therefore the other elements will be wholly transformed into fire.

On the contrary, A gloss on 1 Cor. 7:31,
> The fashion of this world passeth away,
says: [7]
> The beauty, not the substance, passeth.
But the very substance of the elements belongs to the perfection of the world. Therefore the elements will not be consumed as to their substance.

Further, This final cleansing that will be effected by fire will correspond to the first cleansing which was effected by water. Now the latter did not corrupt the substance of the elements. Therefore neither will the former which will be the work of fire.

I answer that, There are many opinions on this question. For some say that all the elements will remain as to their matter, while all will be changed as regards their imperfection, but that two of them will retain their respective substantial form, namely air and earth, while two of them, namely fire and water, will not retain their substantial form but will be changed to the form of heaven. In this way three elements, namely air, fire, and water, will be called heaven; although air will retain the same substantial form as it has now, since even now it is called heaven. Therefore (Apoc. 21:1) only heaven and earth are mentioned:
> I saw, says he, a new heaven and a new earth.
But this opinion is altogether absurd, for it is opposed both to philosophy—which holds it impossible for the lower bodies to be in potency to the form of heaven, since they have neither a common matter, nor mutual contrariety; and to theology, since according to this opinion the perfection of the universe with the integrity of its parts will not be assured on account of two of the elements being destroyed.

Consequently heaven is taken to denote the fifth body, while all the elements are designated by earth, as expressed in Ps. 148:7-8,
> Praise the Lord from the earth
and afterwards,
> Fire, hail, snow, ice, etc.
Hence others say that all the elements will remain as to their substance, but that their active and passive qualities will be taken from them; even as they say too, that in a mixed body the elements retain their substantial form without having their proper qualities, since these are reduced to a mean, and a mean is neither of the extremes. And the following words of Augustine [8] would seem in agreement with this:
> In this conflagration of the world the qualities of the corruptible elements that were befitting our corruptible bodies will entirely perish by fire, and the substance itself will have those qualities that become an immortal body.
However, this does not seem probable, for since the proper qualities of the elements are the effects of their substantial form, it seems impossible, as long as the substantial forms remain, for these qualities to be changed, except for a time by some violent action; thus in hot water we see that by virtue of its species it returns to the cold temperature which it had lost by the action of fire, provided the species of water remain. Moreover, these same elemental qualities belong to the second perfection of the elements, as being their proper passions; nor is it probable that in this final consummation the elements will lose anything of their natural perfection.

Therefore it would seem that the reply to this question should be that the elements will remain as to their substance and proper qualities, but that they will be cleansed both from the stain which they contracted from the sins of men, and from the impurity resulting in them through their mutual action and passion; because when once the movement of the first movable body ceases, mutual action and passion will be impossible in the lower elements; and this is what Augustine calls the "qualities of corruptible elements," namely their unnatural dispositions by reason of which they come near to corruption.

Reply Obj. 1. That fire is said to engulf the four elements in so far as in some way it will cleanse them. But when it is said further that it will consume two entirely, this does not mean that two of the elements are to be destroyed as to their substance, but that two will be more changed from the property which they have now. Some say that these two are fire and water which excel the others in their active qualities, namely heat and cold, which are the chief principles of corruption in other bodies; and since then there will be no action of fire and water which surpass the others in activity, they would seem especially to be changed from the power which they have now. Others, however, say that these two are air and water, on account of the various movements of these two elements, which movements they derive from the movement of the heavenly bodies. And since these movements will cease (such as the ebb and flow of the sea, and the disturbances of winds and so forth), therefore these elements especially will be changed from the property which they have now.

Reply Obj. 2. As Augustine says, [9] when it is stated: "And the sea is no more," by the sea we may understand the present world of which he had said previously (Apoc. 20:13):
> The sea gave up the dead that were in it.
If, however, the sea be taken literally we must reply that by the sea two things are to be understood, namely the substance of the waters, and their disposition, as containing salt and as to the movement of the waves. The sea will remain, not as to this second, but as to the first.

Reply Obj. 3. This fire will not act save as the instrument of God’s providence and power; therefore it will not act on the other elements so as to consume them but only so as to cleanse them. Nor is it necessary for that which becomes the matter of fire to have its proper species taken away entirely, as appears in incandescent iron, which by virtue of its species that remains returns to its proper and former state as soon as it is taken from the furnace. It will be the same with the elements after they are cleansed by fire.

Reply Obj. 4. In the elemental parts we must consider not only what is befitting a part considered in itself, but also what is befitting it in its relation to the whole. I say, then, that although water would be more noble if it had the form of fire, as likewise would earth and air, yet the universe would be more imperfect if all elemental matter were to assume the form of fire.

## Article 6. Whether All the Elements Will Be Cleansed By That Fire?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that neither will all the elements be cleansed by that fire.

Objection 1. Because that fire, as stated already (a. 4, Arg. 2, on the contrary), will not rise higher than the waters of the deluge. But the waters of the deluge did not reach to the sphere of fire. Therefore neither will the element of fire be cleansed by the final cleansing.

Obj. 2. Further, A gloss on Apoc. 21:1, "I saw a new heaven," etc., says: [10]
> There can be no doubt that the transformation of the air and earth will be caused by fire; but it is doubtful about water, since it is believed to have the power of cleansing itself.
Therefore at least it is uncertain that all the elements will be cleansed.

Obj. 3. Further, A place where there is an everlasting stain is never cleansed. Now there will always be a stain in hell. Since, then, hell is situated among the elements, it would seem that the elements will not be wholly cleansed.

Obj. 4. Further, The earthly paradise is situated on the earth. Yet it will not be cleansed by fire, since not even the waters of the deluge reached it, as Bede says, [11] as is stated in II *Sent.*, d. 17. [12] Therefore it would seem that the elements will not all be wholly cleansed.

On the contrary, The gloss quoted above (a. 5, obj. 1) on 2 Pet. 3:12 declares [13] that
> this fire will engulf the four elements.

I answer that, Some say that the fire in question will rise to the summit of the space containing the four elements, so that the elements would be entirely cleansed both from the stain of sin by which also the higher parts of the elements were infected (as instanced by the smoke of idolatry which stained the higher regions), and again from corruption, since the elements are corruptible in all their parts. But this opinion is opposed to the authority of Scripture, because it is written (2 Pet. 3:7) that those heavens are kept in store unto fire, which were cleansed by water; and Augustine says [14] that
> the same world which perished in the deluge is reserved unto fire.
Now it is clear that the waters of the deluge did not rise to the summit of the space occupied by the elements, but only 15 cubits above the mountain tops; and moreover it is known that vapours or any smoke whatever rising from the earth cannot pierce the entire sphere of fire so as to reach its summit; and so the stain of sin did not reach the aforesaid space. Nor can the elements be cleansed from corruptibility by the removal of something that might be consumed by fire, while it will be possible for the impurities of the elements arising from their mingling together to be consumed by fire. And these impurities are chiefly round about the earth as far as the middle of the air; therefore the fire of the final conflagration will cleanse up to that point, since the waters of the deluge rose to a height which can be approximately calculated from the height of the mountains which they surpassed in a fixed measure.

We therefore grant the First Objection.

Reply Obj. 2. The reason for doubt is expressed in the gloss, because, that is, water is believed to have in itself the power of cleansing, yet not such a power as will be sufficient to the future state, as stated above (a. 2, Reply 2).

Reply Obj. 3. The purpose of this cleansing will be chiefly to remove all imperfection from the abode of the saints. Consequently in this cleansing all that is foul will be brought together to the place of the damned; and so hell will not be cleansed, and the dregs of the whole earth will be brought there (Ps. 74:9).

Reply Obj. 4. Although the sin of the first man was committed in the earthly paradise, this is not the place of sinners, as neither is the empyrean heaven, since from both places man and devil were expelled at once after their sin. Consequently that place needs no cleansing.

## Article 7. Whether the Fire of the Final Conflagration Is To Follow the Judgment?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that the fire of the final conflagration is to follow the judgment.

Objection 1. For Augustine [15] gives the following order of the things to take place at the judgment, saying:
> At this judgment we have learnt that the following things will occur, Elias the Thesbite will appear, the Jews will believe, Antichrist will persecute, Christ will judge, the dead shall rise again, the good shall be separated from the wicked, the world shall be set on fire and shall be renewed.
Therefore the burning will follow the judgment.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says: [16]
> After the wicked have been judged, and cast into everlasting fire, the figure of this world will perish in the furnace of worldly flames.
Therefore the same conclusion follows.

Obj. 3. Further, When the Lord comes to judgment He will find some men living, as appears from the words of 1 Thess. 4:16, where the Apostle speaking in their person, says:
> Then we who are alive, who remain unto the coming to the Lord. [17]
But it would not be so if the burning of the world were to come first, since they would be destroyed by the fire. Therefore this fire will follow the judgment.

Obj. 4. Further, It is said that our Lord will come to judge the earth by fire (2 Thess. 1:7), and consequently the final conflagration would seem to be the execution of the sentence of Divine judgment. Now execution follows judgment. Therefore that fire will follow the judgment.

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 96:3):
> A fire shall go before Him.

Further, The resurrection will precede the judgment, for otherwise every eye would not see Christ judging. Now the burning of the world will precede the resurrection, for the saints who will rise again will have spiritual and impassible bodies, so that it will be impossible for the fire to cleanse them, and yet the text (IV *Sent.*, d. 47) [18] quotes Augustine [19] as saying that
> whatever needs cleansing in any way shall be cleansed by that fire.
Therefore that fire will precede the judgment.

I answer that, The fire in question will in reality, as regards its beginning, precede the judgment. This can clearly be gathered from the fact that the resurrection of the dead will precede the judgment, since according to 1 Thess. 4:13-16,
> those who have slept shall be taken up . . . in the clouds . . . into the air . . . to meet Christ coming to judgment.
Now the general resurrection and the glorification of the bodies of the saints will happen at the same time, for the saints in rising again will assume a glorified body, as evidenced by 1 Cor. 15:43,
> It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory;
and at the same time as the saints’ bodies shall be glorified, all creatures shall be renewed, each in its own way, as appears from the statement (Rom. 8:21) that
> the creature . . . itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
Since then the burning of the world is a disposition to this renewal, as stated above (aa. 1, 4), it can clearly be gathered that this burning, so far as it shall cleanse the world, will precede the judgment, but as regards a certain action, whereby it will engulf the wicked, it will follow the judgment.

Reply Obj. 1. Augustine is speaking not as one who decides the point, but as expressing an opinion. This is clear from his continuing thus:
> That all these things are to happen is a matter of faith, but how and in what order we shall learn more then by experience of the things themselves than now by seeking a definite conclusion by arguing about them. I think, however, they will occur in the order I have given.
Hence it is clear that he is speaking as offering his opinion. The same answer applies to the Second Objection.

Reply Obj. 3. All men shall die and rise again; yet those are said to be found alive who will live in the body until the time of the conflagration.

Reply Obj. 4. That fire will not carry out the sentence of the judge except as regards the engulfing of the wicked; in this respect it will follow the judgment.

## Article 8. Whether That Fire Will Have Such an Effect on Men As Is Described?

We proceed thus to the Eighth Article: It would seem that this fire will not have such an effect on men as is described. [20]

Objection 1. For a thing is said to be consumed when it is reduced to nothing. Now the bodies of the wicked will not be reduced to nothing, but will be kept for eternity, that they may bear an eternal punishment. Therefore this fire will not consume the wicked, as stated in the text. [21]

Obj. 2. Further, If it be said that it will consume the bodies of the wicked by reducing them to ashes, on the contrary: Just as the bodies of the wicked, so will those of the good be brought to ashes, for it is the privilege of Christ alone that His flesh see not corruption. Therefore it will consume also the good who will then be found.

Obj. 3. Further, The stain of sin is more abundant in the elements, which combine together to the formation of the human body in which is the corruption of the fomes even in the good, than in the elements existing outside the human body. Now the elements existing outside the human body will be cleansed on account of the stain of sin. Much therefore will the elements in the human body whether of the good or of the wicked need to be cleansed, and consequently the bodies of both will need to be destroyed.

Obj. 4. Further, As long as the state of the way lasts the elements act in like manner on the good and the wicked. Now the state of the way will still endure in that conflagration, since after this state of the way death will not be natural, and yet it will be caused by that fire. Therefore that fire will act equally on good and wicked; and consequently it does not seem that any distinction is made between them as to their being affected by that fire, as stated in the text.

Obj. 5. Further, This fire will have done its work in a moment as it were. Yet there will be many among the living in whom there will be many things to be cleansed. Therefore that fire will not suffice for their cleansing.

I answer that, This fire of the final conflagration, in so far as it will precede the judgment, will act as the instrument of Divine justice as well as by the natural power of fire. Accordingly, as regards its natural power, it will act in like manner on the wicked and good who will be alive, by reducing the bodies of both to ashes. But in so far as it acts as the instrument of Divine justice, it will act differently on different people as regards the sense of pain. For the wicked will be tortured by the action of the fire; but the good in whom there will be nothing to cleanse will feel no pain at all from the fire, as neither did the children in the fiery furnace (Dan. 3), although their bodies will not be kept whole, as were the bodies of the children, and it will be possible by God’s power for their bodies to be destroyed without their suffering pain. But the good, in whom matter for cleansing will be found, will suffer pain from that fire, more or less according to their different merits.

On the other hand, as regards the action which this fire will have after the judgment, it will act on the damned alone, since the good will all have impassible bodies.

Reply Obj. 1. Consumption there signifies being brought, not to nothing, but to ashes.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the bodies of the good will be reduced to ashes by the fire, they will not suffer pain thereby, as neither did the children in the Babylonian furnace. In this respect a distinction is drawn between the good and the wicked.

Reply Obj. 3. The elements that are in human bodies, even in the bodies of the elect, will be cleansed by fire. But this will be done, by God’s power, without their suffering pain.

Reply Obj. 4. This fire will act not only according to the natural power of the element, but also as the instrument of Divine justice.

Reply Obj. 5. There are three reasons why those who will be found living will be able to be cleansed suddenly. One is because there will be few things in them to be cleansed, since they will be already cleansed by the previous fears and persecutions. The second is because they will suffer pain both while living and of their own will, and pain suffered in this life voluntarily cleanses much more than pain inflicted after death, as in the case of the martyrs, because "if anything needing to be cleansed be found in them, it is cut off by the sickle of suffering," as Augustine says (*De Unico Baptismo contra Petilianum*, xiii), [22] although the pain of martyrdom is of short duration in comparison with the pain endured in purgatory. The third is because the heat will gain in intensity what it loses in shortness of time.

## Article 9. Whether That Fire Will Engulf the Wicked?

We proceed thus to the Ninth Article: It would seem that that fire will not engulf the wicked.

Objection 1. For a gloss on Mal. 3:3,
> He shall purify the sons of Levi,
says that "it is a fire consuming the wicked and refining the good"; and a gloss on 1 Cor. 3:13,
> Fire shall try every man's work,
says: [23]
> We read that there will be a twofold fire, one that will cleanse the elect and will precede the judgment, another that will torture the wicked.
Now the latter is the fire of hell that shall engulf the wicked, while the former is the fire of the final conflagration. Therefore the fire of the final conflagration will not be that which will engulf the wicked.

Obj. 2. Further, That fire will obey God in the cleansing of the world. Therefore it should receive its reward like the other elements, especially since fire is the most noble of the elements. Therefore it would seem that it ought not to be cast into hell for the punishment of the damned.

Obj. 3. Further, The fire that will engulf the wicked will be the fire of hell, and this fire was prepared from the beginning of the world for the damned; hence it is written (Matt. 25:41):
> Depart . . . you cursed . . . into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil, etc.,
and (Isa. 30:33):
> Topheth is prepared from yesterday, prepared by the king, etc.,
where a gloss observes: [24]
> From yesterday—that is, from the beginning—Topheth—that is, the valley of hell.
But this fire of the final conflagration was not prepared from the beginning, but will result from the meeting together of the fires of the world. Therefore that fire is not the fire of hell which will engulf the wicked.

On the contrary, are the words of Ps. 96:3, where it is said of this fire that
> it shall burn His enemies round about.

Further, It is written (Dan. 7:10):
> A swift stream of fire issued forth from before Him;
and a gloss adds, [25] "to drag sinners into hell." Now the passage quoted refers to that fire of which we are now speaking, as appears from a gloss which observes on the same words: [26]
> In order to punish the wicked and cleanse the good.
Therefore the fire of the final conflagration will be plunged into hell together with the wicked.

I answer that, The entire cleansing of the world and the renewal for the purpose of cleansing will be directed to the renewal of man, and consequently the cleansing and renewal of the world must correspond with the cleansing and renewal of mankind. Now mankind will be

## SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 75 ART. 1

Reply Obj. 1. The fire that will cleanse the elect before the judgment will be the same as the fire that will burn the world, although some say the contrary. For it is fitting that man, being a part of the world, be cleansed with the same fire as the world. They are, however, described as two fires, that will cleanse the good, and torture the wicked, both in reference to their respective offices, and somewhat in reference to their substance, since the substance of the cleansing fire will not all be cast into hell, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 2. This fire will be purified because whatever it contains of gross matter will be separated from it, and cast into hell.

Reply Obj. 3. The punishment of the wicked, even as the glory of the elect, will be greater after the judgment than before. Therefore, just as charity will be added to the higher creature in order to increase the glory of the elect, so too whatever is vile in creatures will be thrust down into hell in order to add to the misery of the damned. Consequently it is not unfitting that another fire be added to the fire of the damned that was prepared from the beginning of the world.

## 1. The Resurrection Itself

### QUESTION LXXV
Of the resurrection
(In Three Articles)

In the next place we must consider things connected with and accompanying the resurrection. Of these the first to be considered will be the resurrection itself; the second will be the cause of the resurrection (q. lxxvi); the third its time and manner (q. lxxvii); the fourth its term from which (q. lxxviii); the fifth the condition of those who rise again (q. lxxix).

Under the first head there will be three points of inquiry: (1) Whether there is to be a resurrection of the body? (2) Whether it is generally of all bodies? (3) Whether it is natural or miraculous?

### Article 1. Whether There Is To Be a Resurrection of the Body?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that there is not to be a resurrection of the body.

Objection 1. For it is written (Job 14:12): *Man when he is fallen asleep, shall not rise again till the heavens be broken.* But the heavens shall never be broken, since the earth, to which it seems this is still less applicable, *standeth for ever* (Eccles. 1:4). Therefore the man that is dead shall never rise again.

Obj. 2. Further, Our Lord proves the resurrection by quoting the words: *I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living* (Matt. 22:32; Exod. 3:6). But it is clear that when those words were uttered, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived not in body, but only in the soul. Therefore there will be no resurrection of bodies but only of souls.

Obj. 3. Further, The Apostle (1 Cor. 15) seems to prove the resurrection from the reward for labours endured by the saints in this life. For if they trusted in this life alone, they would be the most unhappy of all men. Now there can be sufficient reward for labour in the soul alone, since it is not necessary for the instrument to be repaid together with the worker, and the body is the soul’s instrument. Therefore even in purgatory, where souls will be punished for what they did in the body, the soul is punished without the body. Therefore there is no need to hold a resurrection of the body, but it is enough to hold a resurrection of souls, which consists in their being taken from the death of sin and unhappiness to the life of grace and glory.

Obj. 4. Further, The last (state) of a thing is the most perfect, since thereby it attains its end. Now the most perfect state of the soul is to be separated from the body, since in that state it is more conformed to God and the angels, and is more pure, as being separated from any extraneous nature. Therefore separation from the body is its final state, and consequently it does not return from this state to the body, as neither does a man end in becoming a boy.

Obj. 5. Further, Bodily death is the punishment inflicted on man for his own transgression, as appears from Gen. 2, even as spiritual death, which is the separation of the soul from God, is inflicted on man for mortal sin. Now man never returns to life from spiritual death after receiving the sentence of his damnation. Therefore neither will there be any return from bodily death to bodily life, and so there will be no resurrection.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 19:25-26): *I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth, and I shall be clothed again with my skin*, etc. Therefore there will be a resurrection of the body.

Further, The gift of Christ is greater than the sin of Adam, as appears from Rom. 5:15. Now death was brought in by sin, for if sin had not been, there had been no death. Therefore by the gift of Christ man will be restored from death to life.

Further, The members should be conformed to the head. Now our Head lives and will live eternally in body and soul, since *Christ rising again from the dead dieth now no more* (Rom. 6:8). Therefore men who are His members will live in body and soul; and consequently there must be a resurrection of the body.

*I answer that,* According to the various opinions about man’s last end there have been various opinions holding or denying the resurrection. For man’s last end which all men desire naturally is happiness. Some have held that man is able to attain this end in this life; therefore they had no need to admit another life after this, in which man would be able to attain to his perfection, and so they denied the resurrection. But this opinion is confuted with sufficient probability by the changeableness of fortune, the weakness of the human body, the imperfection and instability of knowledge and virtue, all of which are hindrances to the perfection of happiness, as Augustine argues.¹

Hence others maintained that after this there is another life wherein, after death, man lives according to the soul only, and they held that such a life sufficed to satisfy the natural desire to obtain happiness; therefore Porphyrius said² as Augustine states³:
> “The soul, to be happy, must avoid all bodies”;
and consequently these did not hold the resurrection. This opinion was based by various people on various false foundations. For certain heretics asserted that all bodily things are from the evil principle, but that spiritual things are from the good principle: and from this it follows that the soul cannot reach the height of its perfection unless it be separated from the body, since the latter withdraws it from its principle, the participation of which makes it happy. Hence all those heretical sects that hold corporeal things to have been created or fashioned by the devil deny the resurrection of the body. The falsehood of this principle has been shown at the beginning of the second Book.⁴

Others said that the entire nature of man is seated in the soul, so that the soul makes use of the body as an instrument, or as a sailor uses his ship; therefore according to this opinion, it follows that if happiness is attained by the soul alone, man would not be baulked in his natural desire for happiness, and so there is no need to hold the resurrection. But the Philosopher sufficiently destroys this foundation,⁵ where he shows that the soul is united to the body as form to matter. Hence it is clear that if man cannot be happy in this life, we must of necessity hold the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 1. The heavens will never be destroyed as to their substance, but as to the effect of their power whereby their movement is the cause of generation and corruption of lower things; for this reason the Apostle says (1 Cor. 7:31):
> *The fashion of this world passeth away.*

Reply Obj. 2. Abraham’s soul, properly speaking, is not Abraham himself, but a part of him (and the same as regards the others). Hence life in Abraham’s soul does not suffice to make Abraham a living being, or to make the God of Abraham the God of a living man. But there needs to be life in the whole composite, that is, the soul and body, and although this life was not actually when these words were uttered, it was in each part as ordained to the resurrection. Therefore our Lord proves the resurrection with the greatest subtlety and efficacy.

Reply Obj. 3. The soul is compared to the body, not only as a worker to the instrument with which he works, but also as form to matter; therefore the work belongs to the composite and not to the soul alone, as the Philosopher shows.⁶ And since to the worker is due the reward of the work, it is necessary that man himself, who is composed of soul and body, receive the reward of his work. Now as venial offences are called sins as being dispositions to sin, and not as having absolutely and perfectly the character of sin, so the punishment which is awarded to them in purgatory is not a retribution absolutely, but rather a cleansing, which is wrought separately in the body, by death and by its being reduced to ashes, and in the soul by the fire of purgatory.

Reply Obj. 4. Other things being equal, the state of the soul in the body is more perfect than outside the body, because it is a part of the whole composite, and every integral part is material in respect to the whole (although it is more conformed to God relatively). Because, strictly speaking, a thing is more conformed to God when it has all that the condition of its nature requires, since then most of all it imitates the Divine perfection. Hence the heart of an animal is more conformed to an immovable God when it is in movement than when it is at rest, because the perfection of the heart is in its movement, and its rest is its undoing.

Reply Obj. 5. Bodily death was brought about by Adam’s sin which was blotted out by Christ’s death; hence its punishment does not last for ever. But mortal sin which causes everlasting death through impenitence will not be expiated hereafter. Hence that death will be everlasting.

### Article 2. Whether the Resurrection Will Be for All Without Exception?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the resurrection will not be for all without exception.

Objection 1. For it is written (Ps. 1:5): *The wicked shall not rise again in judgment.* Now men will not rise again except at the time of the general judgment. Therefore the wicked shall in no way rise again.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (Dan. 12:2): *Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.* But these words imply a certain restriction. Therefore all will not rise again.

Obj. 3. Further, By the resurrection men are conformed to Christ rising again; therefore the Apostle argues (1 Cor. 15:12, seqq.) that if Christ rose again, we also shall rise again. Now those alone should be conformed to Christ rising again who have borne His image, and this belongs to the good alone. Therefore they alone shall rise again.

Obj. 4. Further, Punishment is not remitted unless the fault is condoned. Now bodily death is the punishment of original sin. Therefore, as original sin is not forgiven to all, all will not rise again.

Obj. 5. Further, As we are born again by the grace of Christ, even so shall we rise again by His grace. Now those who die in their mother’s womb can never be born again; therefore neither can they rise again, and consequently all will not rise again.

On the contrary, It is said (John 5:28): *All that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God, . . . and they that hear shall live.* Therefore the dead shall all rise again.

Further, It is written (1 Cor. 15:51):
> *We shall all indeed rise again*, etc.

Further, The resurrection is necessary in order that those who rise again may receive punishment or reward according to their merits. Now either punishment or reward is due to all, either for their own merits, as to adults, or for others’ merits, as to children. Therefore all will rise again.

*I answer that,* Those things the reason of which comes from the nature of a species must be found in a like manner in all the members of that same species. Now such is the resurrection, because the reason for the resurrection, as stated above (a. 1, Reply 4), is that the soul cannot have the final perfection of the human species so long as it is separated from the body. Hence no soul will remain for ever separated from the body. Therefore it is necessary for all, as well as for one, to rise again.

Reply Obj. 1. As a gloss expounds these words,¹ they refer to the spiritual resurrection whereby the wicked shall not rise again in the particular judgment. Or else they refer to the wicked who are altogether unbelievers, who will not rise again to be judged, since they are already judged (John 3:18).

Reply Obj. 2. Augustine explains “many” as meaning “all”;² in fact, this way of speaking is often met with in Holy Writ.³ Or else the restriction may refer to the children consigned to limbo who, although they shall rise again, are not properly said to awake, since they will have no sense either of pain or of glory, and waking is the unchaining of the senses.

Reply Obj. 3. All, both good and wicked, are conformed to Christ, while living in this life, as regards things pertaining to the nature of the species, but not as regards matters pertaining to grace. Hence all will be conformed to Him in the restoration of natural life, but not in the likeness of glory, except the good alone.

Reply Obj. 4. Those who have died in original sin have, by dying, discharged the obligation of death which is the punishment of original sin. Hence, notwithstanding original sin, they can rise again from death, for the punishment of original sin is to die, rather than to be detained by death.

Reply Obj. 5. We are born again by the grace of Christ that is given to us, but we rise again by the grace of Christ whereby it came about that He took our nature, since it is by this that we are conformed to Him in natural things. Hence those who die in their mother’s womb, although they are not born again by receiving grace, will nevertheless rise again on account of the conformity of their nature with Him, which conformity they acquired by attaining to the perfection of the human species.

### Article 3. Whether the Resurrection Is Natural?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the resurrection is natural.

Objection 1. For, as the Damascene says (*De Fide Orthod.* III, 14),¹ “that which is commonly observed in all, marks the nature of the individuals contained under it.” Now resurrection applies commonly to all. Therefore it is natural.

Obj. 2. Further, Gregory says (*Moral*, XIV, 55):²
> “Those who do not hold the resurrection on the principle of obedience ought certainly to hold it on the principle of reason. For what does the world every day but imitate, in its elements, our resurrection?”
And he offers as examples the light which as it were dies, and is withdrawn from our sight, and again rises anew, as it were, and is recalled—the shrubs which lose their greenery, and again by a kind of resurrection are renewed—and the seeds which rot and die and then sprout and rise again as it were, which same example is given by the Apostle (1 Cor. 15:36). Now from the works of nature nothing can be known save what is natural. Therefore the resurrection is natural.

Obj. 3. Further, Things that are against nature do not remain for long, because they are violent, so to speak. But the life that is restored by the resurrection will last for ever. Therefore the resurrection will be natural.

Obj. 4. Further, That to which the entire expectation of nature looks forward would seem to be natural. Now such a thing is the resurrection and the glorification of the saints according to Rom. 8:19. Therefore the resurrection will be natural.

Obj. 5. Further, The resurrection is a kind of movement towards the everlasting union of soul and body. Now movement is natural if it terminates in a natural rest,³ and the everlasting union of soul and body will be natural, for since the soul is the body’s proper mover, it has a body proportionate to it, so that the body is likewise for ever capable of being quickened by it, even as the soul lives for ever. Therefore the resurrection will be natural.

On the contrary, There is no natural return from privation to habit. But death is privation of life. Therefore the resurrection whereby one returns from death to life is not natural.

Further, Things of the one species have one fixed way of origin; hence animals begotten of putrefaction are never of the same species as those begotten of seed, as the Commentator says on the *Physics*.⁴ Now the natural way of man’s origin is for him to be begotten of a like in species, and such is not the case in the resurrection. Therefore it will not be natural.

*I answer that,* A movement or an action stands related to nature in three ways. For there is a movement or action of which nature is neither the principle nor the term, and such a movement is sometimes from a principle above nature as in the case of a glorified body, and sometimes from any other principle whatever; for instance, the violent upward movement of a stone which terminates in a violent rest. Again, there is a movement of which nature is both principle and term; for instance, the downward movement of a stone. And there is another movement of which nature is the term, but not the principle, the latter being sometimes something above nature (as in giving sight to a blind man, for sight is natural, but the principle of the sight-giving is above nature), and sometimes something else, as in the forcing of flowers or fruit by artificial process. It is impossible for nature to be the principle and not the term, because natural principles are appointed to definite effects, beyond which they cannot extend.

Therefore the action or movement that is related to nature in the first way can in no way be natural, but is either miraculous if it come from a principle above nature, or violent if from any other principle. The action or movement that is related to nature in the second way is natural absolutely; but the action that is related to nature in the third way cannot be described as natural absolutely, but as natural in a restricted sense, in so far, that is, as it leads to that which is according to nature; but it is called either miraculous or artificial or violent. For, properly speaking, natural is that which is according to nature, and a thing is according to nature if it has that nature and whatever results from that nature.¹ Consequently, speaking absolutely, movement cannot be described as natural unless its principle be natural.

Now nature cannot be the principle of resurrection, although resurrection terminates in the life of nature. For nature is the principle of movement in the thing in which nature is,—either the active principle, as in the movement of heavy and light bodies and in the natural alterations of animals,—or the passive principle, as in the generation of simple bodies. The passive principle of natural generation is the natural passive potency which always has an active power corresponding to it in nature, according to the *Metaphysics*;² nor as to this does it matter whether the active principle in nature correspond to the passive principle in respect of its ultimate perfection, namely the form; or in respect of a disposition in virtue of which it demands the ultimate form, as in the generation of a man according to the teaching of faith, or in all other generations according to the opinions of Plato³ and Avicenna.⁴ But in nature there is no active principle of the resurrection, neither as regards the union of the soul with the body, nor as regards the disposition which is the demand for that union, since such a disposition cannot be produced by nature except in a definite way by the process of generation from seed. Therefore even granted a passive potency on the part of the body, or any kind of inclination to its union with the soul, it is not such as to suffice for the conditions of natural movement. Therefore the resurrection, strictly speaking, is miraculous and not natural except in a restricted sense, as we have explained.

Reply Obj. 1. Damascene is speaking of those things that are found in all individuals and are caused by the principles of nature. For supposing by a divine operation all men to be made white, or to be gathered together in one place, as happened at the time of the deluge, it would not follow that whiteness or to be in some particular place is a natural property of man.

Reply Obj. 2. From natural things one does not come by a demonstration of reason to know non-natural things, but by a persuasion of reason one may know something above nature, since the natural bears a certain resemblance to the supernatural. Thus the union of soul and body resembles the union of the soul with God by the glory of final enjoyment, as the Master says (II *Sent.*, d. 1),⁵ and in like manner the examples quoted by the Apostle and Gregory are confirmatory evidences of our faith in the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 3. This argument regards an operation which terminates in something that is not natural but contrary to nature. Such is not the resurrection, and hence the argument is not to the point.

Reply Obj. 4. The entire operation of nature is subordinate to the Divine operation, just as the working of a lower art is subordinate to the working of a higher art. Hence just as all the work of a lower art has in view an end unattainable save by the operation of the higher art that produces the form, or makes use of what has been made by art, so the last end which the whole expectation of nature has in view is unattainable by the operation of nature, and for this reason the attaining to it is not natural.

Reply Obj. 5. Although there can be no natural movement terminating in a violent rest, there can be a non-natural movement terminating in a natural rest, as explained above.

## QUESTION LXXVI
OF THE CAUSE OF THE RESURRECTION
(In Three Articles)

We must next consider the cause of our resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether Christ’s resurrection is the cause of our resurrection? (2) Whether the sound of the trumpet is? (3) Whether the angels are?

### Article 1. Whether the Resurrection of Christ Is the Cause of Our Resurrection?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the resurrection of Christ is not the cause of our resurrection.

Objection 1. For, given the cause, the effect follows. Yet given the resurrection of Christ the resurrection of the other dead did not follow at once. Therefore His resurrection is not the cause of ours.

Obj. 2. Further, An effect cannot be unless the cause precedes. But the resurrection of the dead would be even if Christ had not risen again, for God could have delivered man in some other way. Therefore Christ’s resurrection is not the cause of ours.

Obj. 3. Further, The same thing produces the one effect throughout the one same species. Now the resurrection will be common to all men. Since then Christ’s resurrection is not its own cause, it is not the cause of the resurrection of others.

Obj. 4. Further, An effect retains some likeness to its cause. But the resurrection, at least of some, namely the wicked, bears no likeness to the resurrection of Christ. Therefore Christ’s resurrection will not be the cause of theirs.

On the contrary,
> “In every genus that which is first is the cause of those that come after it.”¹
Now Christ, by reason of His bodily resurrection, is called *the first fruits of them that sleep* (1 Cor. 15:20), and *the first-begotten of the dead* (Apoc. 1:5). Therefore His resurrection is the cause of the resurrection of others.

Further, Christ’s resurrection has more in common with our bodily resurrection than with our spiritual resurrection which is by justification. But Christ’s resurrection is the cause of our justification, as appears from Rom. 4:25, where it is said that
> *He rose again for our justification.*
Therefore Christ’s resurrection is the cause of our bodily resurrection.

*I answer that,* Christ by reason of His human nature is called *the mediator of God and men* (1 Tim. 2:5); therefore the Divine gifts are bestowed on men by means of Christ’s humanity. Now just as we cannot be delivered

from spiritual death save by the gift of grace bestowed by God, so neither can we be delivered from bodily death except by resurrection wrought by the Divine power. And therefore as Christ, in respect of His human nature, received the firstfruits of grace from above, and His grace is the cause of our grace, because *of His fulness we all have received . . . grace for grace* (John 1:16), so in Christ has our resurrection begun, and His resurrection is the cause of ours. Thus Christ as God is, as it were, the equivocal cause of our resurrection, but as God and man rising again, He is the proximate and, so to say, the univocal cause of our resurrection.

Now a univocal agent cause produces its effect in likeness to its own form, so that not only is it an efficient, but also an exemplary cause in relation to that effect. This happens in two ways. For sometimes this very form, whereby the agent is likened to its effect, is the direct principle of the action by which the effect is produced, as heat in the fire that heats; and sometimes it is not the form in respect of which this likeness is observed, that is primarily and directly the principle of that action, but the principles of that form. For instance, if a white man beget a white man, the whiteness of the begetter is not the principle of active generation, and yet the whiteness of the begetter is said to be the cause of the whiteness of the begotten, because the principles of whiteness in the begetter are the generative principles causing whiteness in the begotten. In this way the resurrection of Christ is the cause of our resurrection, because the same thing that wrought the resurrection of Christ, which is the univocal efficient cause of our resurrection, operates for our resurrection, namely the power of Christ’s Godhead which is common to Him and the Father. Hence it is written (Rom. 8:11): *He that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies*. And this very resurrection of Christ by virtue of His indwelling Godhead is, as it were, the instrumental cause of our resurrection, since the Divine operations were wrought by means of Christ’s flesh as though it were a kind of organ; thus Damascene instances as an example (*De Fide Orthodoxa*, III, 15; PG 94, 1049) the touch of His body whereby He healed the leper (Matt. 8:3).

Reply Obj. 1. A sufficient cause produces at once its effect to which it is immediately ordered but not the effect to which it is ordered by means of something else, no matter how sufficient it may be; thus heat, however intense it be, does not cause heat at once in the first instant, but it begins at once to set up a movement towards heat, because heat is its effect by means of movement. Now Christ’s resurrection is said to be the cause of ours in that it works our resurrection not immediately, but by means of its principle, namely the Divine power which will work our resurrection in likeness to the resurrection of Christ. Now God’s power works by means of His will which is nearest to the effect; hence it is not necessary that our resurrection should follow at once after He has wrought the resurrection of Christ, but that it should happen at the time which God’s will has decreed.

Reply Obj. 2. God’s power is not tied to any particular second causes, but that He can produce their effects either immediately or by means of other causes; thus He might work the generation of lower bodies even though there were no movement of the heaven, and yet according to the order which He has established in things, the movement of the heaven is the cause of the generation of the lower bodies. In like manner according to the order appointed to human things by Divine providence, Christ’s resurrection is the cause of ours, and yet He could have appointed another order, and then our resurrection would have had another cause ordained by God.

Reply Obj. 3. This argument holds when all the things of one species have the same order to the first cause of the effect to be produced in the whole of that species. But it is not so in the case in point, because Christ’s humanity is nearer to His Godhead, Whose power is the first cause of the resurrection, than is the humanity of others. Hence Christ’s Godhead caused His resurrection immediately, but it causes the resurrection of others by means of Christ-man rising again.

Reply Obj. 4. The resurrection of all men will bear some resemblance to Christ’s resurrection, as regards that which pertains to the life of nature, in respect of which all were conformed to Christ. Hence all will rise again to immortal life; but in the saints who were conformed to Christ by grace, there will be conformity as to things pertaining to glory.

## Article 2. Whether the Sound of the Trumpet Will Be the Cause of Our Resurrection?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the sound of the trumpet will not be the cause of our resurrection.

### Objection 1.
For Damascene says (*De Fide Orthodoxa*, IV, 27; PG 94, 1225): "Believe that the resurrection will take place by God’s will, power, and nod." Therefore since these are a sufficient cause of our resurrection, we ought not to assign the sound of the trumpet as its cause.

### Objection 2.
Further, It is useless to make sounds to one who cannot hear. But the dead will not have hearing. Therefore it is unfitting to make a sound to arouse them.

### Objection 3.
Further, If any sound is the cause of the resurrection, this will only be by a power given by God to the sound; therefore a gloss on Ps. 68:34 (Vulg. 67:34), *He will give to His voice the voice of power*, says, "to arouse our bodies." (Glossa ordinaria III, 179F; Glossa Lombardi, PL 191, 618). Now from the moment that a power is given to a thing, though it be given miraculously, the act that ensues is natural, as instanced in the man born blind who, after being restored to sight, saw naturally. Therefore if a sound be the cause of resurrection, the resurrection would be natural, which is false.

On the contrary, It is written (1 Thess. 4:15): *The Lord Himself will come down from heaven . . . with the trumpet of God; and the dead who are in Christ shall rise*.

Further, It is written (John 5:28) that *they who are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God . . . and (verse 25) they that hear shall live*. Now this voice is called the trumpet, as stated in the text (*IV Sent.,* d. 43; Peter Lombard, QR II, 996). Therefore, etc.

I answer that, Cause and effect must in some way be united together, since mover and moved, maker and made, are simultaneous (Aristotle, *Physics*, VII, 2; 243a3). Now Christ rising again is the univocal cause of our resurrection; therefore at the resurrection of bodies, Christ must bring about the resurrection at the giving of some common bodily sign.

According to some this sign will be literally Christ’s voice commanding the resurrection, even as He commanded the sea and the storm ceased (Matt. 8:26).

Others say that this sign will be nothing else than the manifest reappearance of the Son of God in the world, according to the words of Matt. 24:27: *As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be*. These rely on the authority of Gregory who says that "the sound of the trumpet is nothing else but the Son appearing to the world as judge" (Quoted by Albert, *In Sent.*, IV, d. 43, a. 4; BO XXX, 510). According to this, the visible presence of the Son of God is called His voice (Ps. 68:34; John 5:25), because as soon as He appears all nature will obey His command in restoring human bodies; hence He is described as coming with commandment (1 Thess. 4:15). In this way His appearing, insofar as it has the force of a command, is called His voice, which voice, whatever it be, is sometimes called a cry (Matt. 25:6) as of a crier summoning to judgment; sometimes the sound of a trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thess. 4:15), either on account of its distinctness, as stated in the text (*IV Sent.,* d. 43; Peter Lombard, QR II, 996), or as being in keeping with the use of the trumpet in the Old Testament (Num. 10): for by the trumpet they were summoned to the council, stirred to the battle, and called to the feast; and those who rise again will be summoned to the council of judgment (John 5:28), to the battle in which *the world shall fight . . . against the unwise* (Wisd. 5:21), and to the feast of everlasting solemnity (Matt. 25:34).

Reply Obj. 1. In those words Damascene touches on three things respecting the efficient cause of the resurrection: namely, the Divine will which commands, the power which executes, and the ease of execution, when he adds "nod," in resemblance to our own affairs, since it is very easy for us to do what is done at once at our word. But the ease is much more evident, if before we say a word, our servants execute our will at once at the first sign of our will, which sign is called a nod, and this nod is a kind of cause of that execution, insofar as others are led thereby to accomplish our will. And the Divine nod, at which the resurrection will take place, is nothing but the sign given by God, which all nature will obey by concurring in the resurrection of the dead. This sign is the same as the sound of the trumpet, as explained above.

Reply Obj. 2. As the forms of the Sacrament have the power to sanctify, not through being heard, but through being spoken, so this sound, whatever it be, will have an instrumental efficacy of resuscitation, not through being perceived, but through being uttered. Even so a sound by the pulsation of the air arouses the sleeper, by loosing the organ of perception, and not because it is known, since judgment about the sound that reaches the ears is subsequent to the awakening and is not its cause.

Reply Obj. 3. This argument would avail if the power given to that sound were a complete being in nature, because then that which would proceed from it would have for principle a power already rendered natural. But this power is not of that kind but such as we have ascribed above to the forms of the Sacraments (*In Sent.*, IV, dist. 1, Q. 1, A. 4).

## Article 3. Whether the Angels Will Do Anything Towards the Resurrection?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the angels will do nothing at all towards the resurrection.

### Objection 1.
For raising the dead shows a greater power than does begetting men. Now when men are begotten, the soul is not infused into the body by means of the angels. Therefore neither will the resurrection, which is reunion of soul and body, be wrought by the ministry of the angels.

### Objection 2.
Further, If this is to be ascribed to the instrumentality of any angels at all, it would seem especially referable to the Virtues, to whom it belongs to work miracles. Yet it is referred not to them, but to the Archangels, according to the text (*IV Sent.,* d. 43; Peter Lombard, QR II, 996). Therefore the resurrection will not be wrought by the ministry of the angels.

On the contrary, It is stated (1 Thess. 4:15) that *the Lord . . . shall come down from heaven . . . with the voice of an archangel . . . and the dead shall rise again*. Therefore the resurrection of the dead will be accomplished by the angelic ministry.

I answer that, According to Augustine (*De Trinitate*, III, 4; PL 42, 873), "just as the grosser and inferior bodies are ruled in a certain order by the more subtle and more powerful bodies, so are all bodies ruled by God by the rational spirit of life"; and Gregory speaks in the same sense (*Dialogues*, IV, 6; PL 77, 328). Consequently in all God’s bodily works, He employs the ministry of the angels. Now in the resurrection there is something pertaining to the transmutation of the bodies, namely the gathering together of the mortal remains and their disposal for the restoration of the human body; therefore in this respect God will employ the ministry of the angels in the resurrection. But the soul, even as it is immediately created by God, so will it be reunited to the body immediately by God without any operation of the angels, and in like manner He Himself will glorify the body without the ministry of the angels, just as He immediately glorifies man’s soul. This ministry of the angels is called their voice, according to one explanation (Augustine, *Epist.*, CXL, 34; PL 33, 573) given in the text (*IV Sent.,* d. 43; Lombard, QR II, 996).

Hence the Reply to the First Objection is evident from what has been said.

Reply Obj. 2. This ministry will be exercised chiefly by one Archangel, namely Michael, who is the prince of the Church as he was of the Synagogue (Dan. 10:21; cf. Dan. 12:1). Yet he will act under the influence of the Virtues and the other higher orders, so that what he shall do, the higher orders will, in a way, do also. In like manner the lower angels will cooperate with him as to the resurrection of each individual to whose guardianship they were appointed, so that this voice can be ascribed either "to one or to many angels" (Lombard, *loc. cit.*).

# QUESTION LXXVII: Of the Time and Manner of the Resurrection (In Four Articles)

We must now consider the time and manner of the resurrection. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:

1.  Whether the time of the resurrection should be delayed until the end of the world?
2.  Whether that time is hidden?
3.  Whether the resurrection will occur at night-time?
4.  Whether it will happen suddenly?

## Article 1. Whether the Time of Our Resurrection Should Be Delayed Till the End of the World?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the time of the resurrection ought not to be delayed till the end of the world, so that all may rise together.

### Objection 1.
For there is more conformity between head and members than between one member and another, as there is more between cause and effect than between one effect and another. Now Christ, Who is our Head, did not delay His resurrection until the end of the world, so as to rise again together with all men. Therefore there is no need for the resurrection of the early saints to be deferred until the end of the world, so that they may rise again together with the others.

### Objection 2.
Further, The resurrection of the Head is the cause of the resurrection of the members. But the resurrection of certain members that derive nobility from their being closely connected with the Head was not delayed till the end of the world, but followed immediately after Christ’s resurrection, as is piously believed concerning the Blessed Virgin and John the Evangelist (Cf. Jerome, *Epist.*, IX; PL 30, 127). Therefore the resurrection of others will be so much nearer Christ’s resurrection, according as they have been more conformed to Him by grace and merit.

### Objection 3.
Further, The state of the New Testament is more perfect, and bears a closer resemblance to Christ, than the state of the Old Testament. Yet some of the fathers of the Old Testament rose again when Christ rose, according to Matt. 27:52: *Many of the bodies of the saints, that had slept, arose*. Therefore it would seem that the resurrection of the Old Testament saints should not be delayed till the end of the world, so that all may rise together.

### Objection 4.
Further, There will be no numbering of years after the end of the world. Yet after the resurrection of the dead, the years are still reckoned until the resurrection of others, as appears from Rev. 20:4-5. For it is stated there that *I saw . . . the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God*, and further on: *And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. And the rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were finished*. Therefore the resurrection of all is not delayed until the end of the world, that all may rise together.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 14:12): *Man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again till the heavens be broken, he shall not wake, nor rise out of his sleep*, and it is a question of the sleep of death. Therefore the resurrection of men will be delayed until the end of the world when the heavens shall be destroyed.

Further, It is written (Heb. 11:39): *All these being approved by the testimony of faith received not the promise*, that is "full happiness of soul and body" (Glossa interlinearis VI, 157V; Glossa Lombardi, PL 192, 500), since God has provided something better for us, *lest they should be consummated*, that is "perfected" (*ibid.*), without us, — "in order that," as a gloss observes (*ibid.*), "through all rejoicing each one might rejoice the more." But the resurrection will not precede the glorification of bodies, because *He will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His glory* (Phil. 3:21), and *the children of the resurrection will be as the angels . . . in heaven* (Matt. 22:30). Therefore the resurrection will be delayed till the end of the world, when all shall rise together.

I answer that, As Augustine states (*De Trinitate*, III, 4; PL 42, 873), Divine providence decreed that "the grosser and lower bodies should be ruled in a certain order by the more subtle and powerful bodies; and therefore the entire matter of the lower bodies is subject to change according to the movement of the heavenly bodies." Hence it would be contrary to the order established in things by Divine providence if the matter of lower bodies were brought to the state of incorruption so long as there remains movement in the higher bodies. And since, according to the teaching of faith, the resurrection will bring men to immortal life conformably to Christ Who *rising again from the dead dieth now no more* (Rom. 6:9), the resurrection of human bodies will be delayed until the end of the world when the heavenly movement will cease. For this reason, too, certain philosophers, who held that the movement of the heavens will never cease, maintained that human souls will return to mortal bodies such as we have now, — whether, as Empedocles (Albert, *In Sent.*, IV, d. 43, a. 1, sed contra 2; BO XXX, 501; cf. Empedocles, in Diels, *Die Fragmente*, no. 126, I, 270; cf. below, Q. 91, A. 1, Obj. 4), they stated that the soul would return to the same body at the end of the great year, or that it would return to another body; thus Pythagoras asserted that "any soul will enter any body" (Cf. below, Q. 97, A. 5), as stated in the book *De Anima* (Aristotle, I, 3; 407b2).

Reply Obj. 1. Although the head is more conformed to the members by conformity of proportion (which is requisite in order that it have influence over the members) than one member is to another, yet the head has a certain causality over the members which the members have not; and in this the members differ from the head and agree with one another. Hence Christ’s resurrection is an exemplar of ours, and through our faith therein there arises in us the hope of our own resurrection. But the resurrection of one of Christ’s members is not the cause of the resurrection of other members, and consequently Christ’s resurrection had to precede the resurrection of others who have all to rise again at the consummation of the world.

Reply Obj. 2. Although among the members some rank higher than others and are more conformed to the Head, they do not attain to the character of headship so as to be the cause of others. Consequently greater conformity to Christ does not give them a right to rise again before others as though they were exemplar and the others exemplated, as we have said (Reply 1) in reference to Christ’s resurrection; and if it has been granted to others that their resurrection should not be delayed until the general resurrection, this has been by special privilege of grace, and not as due on account of conformity to Christ.

Reply Obj. 3. Jerome, in a sermon on the Assumption (*Epist.*, IX, *Ad Paulam et Eustochium*; PL 30, 127), seems to be doubtful of this resurrection of the saints with Christ, namely as to whether, having been witnesses to the resurrection, they died again, so that theirs was a resuscitation (as in the case of Lazarus who died again) rather than a resurrection such as will be at the end of the world, — or really rose again to immortal life, to live for ever in the body, and to ascend bodily into heaven with Christ, as a gloss says (Glossa ordinaria V, 86A; Rabanus Maurus, Book VIII, PL 107, 1144) on Matt. 27:52. The latter seems more probable, because, as Jerome says (*ibid.*), in order that they might bear true witness to Christ’s true resurrection, it was fitting that they should truly rise again. Nor was their resurrection hastened for their sake, but for the sake of bearing witness to Christ’s resurrection, and that by bearing witness thereto they might lay the foundation of the faith of the New Testament. Therefore it was more fitting that it should be borne by the fathers of the Old Testament than by those who died after the foundation of the New. It must, however, be observed that, although the Gospel mentions their resurrection before Christ’s, we must take this statement as made in anticipation, as is often the case with writers of history. For none rose again with a true resurrection before Christ, since *He is the firstfruits of them that sleep* (1 Cor. 15:20), although some were resuscitated before Christ’s resurrection, as in the case of Lazarus.

Reply Obj. 4. On account of these words, as Augustine relates (*City of God*, XX, 7; PL 41, 667), certain heretics asserted that there will be a first resurrection of the dead that they may reign with Christ on earth for a thousand years; hence they were called Chiliasts or Millenarians. Hence Augustine says (*ibid.*) that these words are to be understood otherwise, namely of the spiritual resurrection, whereby men shall rise again from their sins to the gift of grace, while the second resurrection is of bodies.

The reign of Christ denotes the Church wherein not only martyrs but also the other elect reign, "the part denoting the whole"; or they reign with Christ in glory as regards all, special mention being made of the martyrs, "because they especially reign after death who fought for the truth, even to death" (*Ibid.*, 9; PL 41, 674).

The number of a thousand years denotes not a fixed number, but the whole of the present time wherein the saints now reign with Christ, because the number 1,000 designates universality more than the number 100, since 100 is the square of 10, whereas 1,000 is a cube resulting from the multiplication of ten by its square, for 10 x 10 = 100, and 100 x 10 = 1,000. Again in Ps. 105:8 (Vulg. 104:8), *The word which He commanded to a thousand*, that is all, generations.

## Article 2. Whether the Time of Our Resurrection Is Hidden?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that this time is not hidden.

### Objection 1.
Because when we know exactly the beginning of a thing, we can know its end exactly, since "all things are measured by a certain period" (Aristotle, *Generation and Corruption*, II, 10; 336b12). Now the beginning of the world is known exactly. Therefore its end can also be known exactly. But this will be the time of the resurrection and judgment. Therefore that time is not hidden.

### Objection 2.
Further, It is stated (Rev. 12:6) that the woman, who represents the Church (Glossa interlinearis, on Rev. 12:1; VI, 257V), had *a place prepared by God, that there she might feed* (Vulg., *they should feed her*) *a thousand two hundred sixty days*. Again (Dan. 12:11), a certain fixed number of days is mentioned, which apparently signify years, according to Ezek. 4:6: *A day for a year, yea a day for a year I have appointed to thee*. Therefore the time of the end of the world and of the resurrection can be known exactly from Holy Writ.

### Objection 3.
Further, The state of the New Testament was foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Now we know exactly the time wherein the state of the Old Testament endured. Therefore we can also know exactly the time wherein the state of the New Testament will endure. But the state of the New Testament will last to the end of the world, and therefore it is said (Matt. 28:20): *Behold I am with you . . . to the consummation of the world*. Therefore the time of the end of the world and of the resurrection can be known exactly.

On the contrary, That which is unknown to the angels will be much more unknown to men, because those things to which men attain by natural reason are much more clearly and certainly known to the angels by their natural knowledge. Moreover, revelations are not made to men save by means of the angels, as Dionysius asserts (*Cael. Hier.*, IV, 2-3; PG 3, 180, 181). Now the angels have no exact knowledge of that time, as appears from Matt. 24:36: *Of that day and hour no one knoweth, no not the angels of heaven*. Therefore that time is hidden from men.

Further, The apostles were more aware of God’s secrets than others who followed them, because they had *the firstfruits of the spirit* (Rom. 8:23), — "before others in point of time and more abundantly," as a gloss observes (Glossa interlinearis VI, 157V; Glossa Lombardi, PL 192, 500). And yet when they questioned our Lord about this very matter, He answered them (Acts 1:7): *It is not for you to know the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power*. Much more, therefore, is it hidden from others.

I answer that, As Augustine says (*City of God*, XX, 7; PL 41, 667), "as to the last age of the human race, which begins from our Lord’s coming and lasts until the end of the world, it is uncertain of how many generations it will consist"; just so old age, which is man’s last age, has no fixed time according to the measure of the other ages, since "sometimes alone it lasts as long a time as all the others." The reason of this is because the exact length of future time cannot be known except either by revelation or by natural reason, and the time until the resurrection cannot be reckoned by natural reason, because the resurrection and the end of the heavenly movement will be simultaneous as stated above (A. 1). And all things that are foreseen by natural reason to happen at a fixed time are reckoned by movement, and it is impossible from the movement of the heaven to reckon its end, for since it is circular, it is for this very reason able by its nature to endure forever, and consequently the time between this and the resurrection cannot be reckoned by natural reason. Again it cannot be known by revelation, so that all may be on the watch and ready to meet Christ, and for this reason when the apostles asked Him about this Christ answered (Acts 1:7): *It is not for you to know the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power*, whereby, as Augustine says (*ibid.*): "He scatters the"

fingers of all calculators and bids them be still." For what He refused to tell the apostles, He will not reveal to others; therefore all those who have been misled to reckon this time have so far proved to be untruthful; for some, as Augustine says,^7 stated that from our Lord’s Ascension to His last coming 400 years would elapse, others 500, others 1,000. The falseness of these calculators is evident, as will likewise be the falseness of those who even now cease not to calculate.

Reply Obj. 1. When we know a thing’s beginning and also its end it follows that its measure is known to us; therefore if we know the beginning of a thing the duration of which is measured by the movement of the heaven, we are able to know its end, since the movement of heaven is known to us. But the measure of the duration of the heavenly movement is God’s ordinance alone, which is unknown to us. Therefore however much we may know its beginning, we are unable to know its end.

Reply Obj. 2. The thousand two hundred sixty days mentioned in the *Apocalypse* (*loc. cit.*) denote all the time during which the Church endures, and not any definite number of years. The reason for this is because the preaching of Christ on which the Church is built lasted three years and a half, which time contains almost an equal number of days as the above-mentioned number. Again the number of days appointed by Daniel does not refer to a number of years to elapse before the end of the world or until the preaching of Antichrist, but to the time of Antichrist’s preaching and the duration of his persecution.

Reply Obj. 3. Although the state of the New Testament in general is foreshadowed by the state of the Old Testament it does not follow that individuals correspond to individuals, especially since all the figures of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Christ. Hence Augustine answers^1 certain persons who wished to liken the number of persecutions suffered by the Church to the number of the plagues of Egypt, in these words: > “I do not think that the occurrences in Egypt were in their signification prophetic of these persecutions, although those who think so have shown nicety and ingenuity in adapting them severally the one to the other, not indeed by a prophetic spirit, but by the guess-work of the human mind, which sometimes reaches the truth and sometimes not.”

The same remarks would seem applicable to the statements of Abbot Joachim, who by means of such conjectures about the future foretold some things that were true, and in others was deceived.^2

### Article 3. Whether the Resurrection Will Take Place at Night-Time?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the resurrection will not be at night-time.

Objection 1. For the resurrection will not be till the heavens be broken (Job 14:12). Now when the heavenly movement ceases, which is signified by its breaking, there will be no time, neither night nor day. Therefore the resurrection will not be at night-time.

Obj. 2. Further, the end of a thing ought to be most perfect. Now the end of time will be then, and therefore it is said (*Apoc.* 10:6) that time shall be no longer. Therefore time ought to be then in its most perfect disposition and consequently it should be the daytime.

Obj. 3. Further, the time should be such as to be adapted to what is done therein; therefore (John 13:30) the night is mentioned as being the time when Judas went out from the fellowship of the light. Now, all things that are hidden at the present time will then be made most manifest, because when the Lord shall come He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts (1 Cor. 4:5). Therefore it ought to be during the day.

On the contrary, Christ’s resurrection is the exemplar of ours. Now Christ’s resurrection was at night, as Gregory says in a homily for Easter (xxi *in Ev.*).^3 Therefore our resurrection will also be at night-time.

Further, the coming of our Lord is compared to the coming of a thief into the house (Luke 12:39-40). But the thief comes to the house at night-time. Therefore our Lord will also come in the night. Now, when He comes the resurrection will take place, as stated above (Q. 76, Art. 2). Therefore the resurrection will be at night-time.

I answer that, the exact time and hour at which the resurrection will be cannot be known for certain, as stated in the text (*iv Sent.*, d. 43).^4 Nevertheless some assert with sufficient probability that it will be towards the twilight, the moon being in the east and the sun in the west, because the sun and moon are believed to have been created in these positions, and thus their revolutions will be altogether completed by their return to the same point. Therefore it is said that Christ arose at such an hour.

Reply Obj. 1. When the resurrection occurs, it will not be time but the end of time, because at the very instant that the heavens will cease to move the dead will rise again. Nevertheless the stars will be in the same position as they occupy now at any fixed hour, and accordingly it is said that the resurrection will be at this or that hour.

Reply Obj. 2. The most perfect disposition of time is said to be midday, on account of the light given by the sun. But then the city of God will need neither sun nor moon, because the glory of God will enlighten it (*Apoc.* 22:5). Therefore in this respect it matters not whether the resurrection be in the day or in the night.

Reply Obj. 3. That time should be adapted to manifestation as regards the things that will happen then, and to secrecy as regards the fixing of the time. Hence either may happen fittingly, namely that the resurrection be in the day or in the night.

### Article 4. Whether the Resurrection Will Happen Suddenly or By Degrees?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the resurrection will not happen suddenly but by degrees.

Objection 1. For the resurrection of the dead is foretold (Ezech. 37:7-8) where it is written:
> The bones came together . . . and I saw and behold the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.
Therefore the restoration of the bodies will precede in time their reunion with the souls, and thus the resurrection will not be sudden.

Obj. 2. Further, a thing does not happen suddenly if it require several actions following one another. Now the resurrection requires several actions following one another, namely the gathering of the ashes, the refashioning of the body, the infusion of the soul. Therefore the resurrection will not be sudden.

Obj. 3. Further, all sound is measured by time. Now the sound of the trumpet will be the cause of the resurrection, as stated above (Q. 76, Art. 2). Therefore the resurrection will take time and will not happen suddenly.

Obj. 4. Further, no local movement can be sudden as stated in the treatise on the *Sense and the Sensible*.^1 Now the resurrection requires local movement in the gathering of the ashes. Therefore it will not happen suddenly.

On the contrary, it is written (1 Cor. 15:51-52):
> We shall all indeed rise again . . . in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
Therefore the resurrection will be sudden.

Further, infinite power works suddenly. But the Damascene says (*De Fide Orthod.* iv, 27):^2
> Thou shalt believe in the resurrection to be wrought by the power of God,
and it is evident that this is infinite. Therefore the resurrection will be sudden.

I answer that, at the resurrection something will be done by the ministry of the angels, and something immediately by the power of God, as stated above (Q. 76, Art. 3). Accordingly that which is done by the ministry of the angels will not be instantaneous, if by instant we mean an indivisible point of time, but it will be instantaneous if by instant we mean an imperceptible time. But that which will be done immediately by God’s power will happen suddenly, namely at the end of the time in which the work of the angels will be done, because the higher power brings the lower to perfection.

Reply Obj. 1. Ezechiel spoke, like Moses, to a rough people, and therefore, just as Moses divided the works of the six days into days, in order that the uncultured people might be able to understand, although all things were made together according to Augustine (*Gen. ad Lit.* iv, 34),^3 so Ezechiel expressed the various things that will happen in the resurrection, although they will all happen together in an instant.

Reply Obj. 2. Although these actions follow one another in nature, they are all together in time, because either they are together in the same instant, or one is in the instant that terminates the other.

Reply Obj. 3. The same would seem to apply to that sound as to the forms of the sacraments, namely that the sound will produce its effect in its last instant.

Reply Obj. 4. The gathering of the ashes which cannot be without local movement will be done by the ministry of the angels. Hence it will be in time though imperceptible on account of the ease of operation which is appropriate to the angels.

## Question LXXVIII: Of the Term From Which of the Resurrection

### (In Three Articles)

We must now consider the term from which of the resurrection, and under this head there are three points of inquiry:

1.  Whether death is the term from which of the resurrection in every case?
2.  Whether ashes are, or dust?
3.  Whether this dust has a natural inclination towards the soul?

### Article 1. Whether Death Will Be the Term From Which of the Resurrection in All Cases?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that death will not be the term from which of the resurrection in all cases.

Objection 1. Because some shall not die but shall be clothed with immortality, for it is said in the creed that our Lord “will come to judge the living and the dead.”^1 Now this cannot refer to the time of judgment, because then all will be alive; therefore this distinction must refer to the previous time, and consequently all will not die before the judgment.

Obj. 2. Further, a natural and common desire cannot be empty and vain, but is fulfilled in some cases. Now according to the Apostle (2 Cor. 5:4) it is a common desire that
> we would not be unclothed but clothed upon.
Therefore there will be some who will never be stripped of the body by death, but will be arrayed in the glory of the resurrection.

Obj. 3. Further, Augustine says (*Enchir.* cxv)^2 that the four last petitions of the Lord’s prayer refer to the present life, and one of them is:
> Forgive us our debts (Douay, — trespasses).
Therefore the Church prays that all debts may be forgiven her in this life. Now the Church’s prayer cannot be void and not granted:
> If you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it you (John 16:23).
Therefore at some time of this life the Church will receive the remission of all debts, and one of the debts to which we are bound by the sin of our first parent is that we be born in original sin. Therefore at some time God will grant to the Church that men be born without original sin. But death is the punishment of original sin. Therefore at the end of the world there will be some men who will not die, and so the same conclusion follows.

Obj. 4. Further, the wise man should always choose the shortest way. Now the shortest way is for the men who shall be found living to be transferred to the impassibility of the resurrection than for them to die first and afterwards rise again from death to immortality. Therefore God Who is supremely wise will choose this way for those who shall be found living.

On the contrary, it is written (1 Cor. 15:36):
> That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die first,
and he is speaking of the resurrection of the body as compared to the seed.

Further, it is written (*ibid.* 15:22):
> As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.
Now all shall be made alive in Christ. Therefore all shall die in Adam, and so all shall rise again from death.

I answer that, the saints differ in speaking on this question, as may be seen in the text (*iv Sent.*, d. 43).^3 However, the safer and more common opinion is that all shall die and rise again from death, and this for three reasons. First, because it is more in accord with Divine justice, which condemned human nature for the sin of its first parent, that all who by the act of nature derive their origin from him should contract the stain of original sin, and consequently be the debtors of death.

Secondly, because it is more in agreement with Divine Scripture which foretells the resurrection of all;^4 and resurrection is not predicted properly except of “that which has fallen and perished,” as the Damascene says (*De Fide Orthod.* iv, 27).^5

Thirdly, because it is more in harmony with the order of nature where we find that what is corrupted and decayed is not renewed except by means of corruption; thus vinegar does not become wine unless the vinegar be corrupted and pass into the juice of the grape. Therefore since human nature has incurred the defect of the necessity of death, it cannot return to immortality save by means of death. It is also in keeping with the order of nature for another reason, because, as it is stated in the *Physics*,^6 the movement of heaven is as “a kind of life to all existing in nature,” just as the movement of the heart is a kind of life of the whole body; therefore even as all the members become dead on the heart ceasing to move, so when the heavenly movement ceases nothing can remain living with that life which was sustained by the influence of that movement. Now such is the life by which we live now, and therefore it follows that those who shall live after the movement of the heaven comes to a standstill must depart from this life.

Reply Obj. 1. This distinction of the dead and the living does not apply to the time itself of the judgment, nor to the whole preceding time, since all who are to be judged were living at some time, and dead at some time; but it applies to that particular time which shall precede the judgment immediately, when, that is, the signs of the judgment shall begin to appear.

Reply Obj. 2. The perfect desire of the saints cannot be in vain, but nothing prevents their conditional desire being in vain. Such is the desire by which we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, namely if that be possible. And this desire is called by some a “velleity.”

Reply Obj. 3. It is erroneous to say that anyone except Christ is conceived without original sin, because those who would be conceived without original sin would not need the redemption which was wrought by Christ, and thus Christ would not be the Redeemer of all men. Nor can it be said that they did not need this redemption because it was granted to them that they should be conceived without sin. For, this grace was vouchsafed—either to their parents, that the sin of nature might be healed in them (because so long as that sin remained they were unable to beget without communicating original sin),—or to nature itself which was healed. Now we must allow that everyone needs the redemption of Christ personally, and not only by reason of nature, and one cannot be delivered from an evil or absolved from a debt unless one incur the debt or incur the evil; and consequently all could not reap in themselves the fruit of the Lord’s prayer unless all were born debtors and subject to evil. Hence the forgiveness of debts or delivery from evil cannot be applied to one who is born without a debt or free from evil, but only to one who is born with a debt and is afterwards delivered by the grace of Christ. Nor does it follow, if it can be asserted without error that some do not die, that they are born without original sin, although death is a punishment of original sin; because God can of His mercy remit the punishment which one has incurred by a past fault, as He forgave the adulterous woman without punishment (John 8); and in like manner He can deliver from death those who have contracted the debt of death by being born in original sin. And thus it does not follow if they do not die that therefore they were born without original sin.

Reply Obj. 4. The shortest way is not always the one to be chosen, but only when it is more or equally adapted for attaining the end. It is not so here, as is clear from what we have said.

### Article 2. Whether All Will Rise Again from Ashes?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that all will not rise again from ashes.

Objection 1. For Christ’s resurrection is the exemplar of ours. Yet His resurrection was not from ashes, for His flesh saw not corruption according to Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:27, 31. Therefore neither will all rise again from ashes.

Obj. 2. Further, the human body is not always burnt. Yet a thing cannot be reduced to ashes unless it be burnt. Therefore not all will rise again from ashes.

Obj. 3. Further, the body of a dead man is not reduced to ashes immediately after death. But some will rise again at once after death, according to the text (*iv Sent.*, d. 43),^1 namely those who will be found living. Therefore all will not rise again from ashes.

Obj. 4. Further, the term from which corresponds to the term to which. Now the term to which of the resurrection is not the same in the good as in the wicked:
> We shall all indeed rise again, but we shall not all be changed (1 Cor. 15:51).
Therefore the term from which is not the same. And thus, if the wicked rise again from ashes, the good will not rise again from ashes.

On the contrary, Haymo says (on Rom. 5:10, > For if when we were enemies):^2 “All who are born in original sin lie under the sentence:
> Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou go.”^3
Now all who shall rise again at the general resurrection were born in original sin, either at their birth within the womb or at least at their birth from the womb. Therefore all will rise again from ashes.

Further, there are many things in the human body that do not truly belong to human nature. But all these will be removed. Therefore all bodies must be reduced to ashes.

I answer that, the same reasons by which we have shown (Art. 1) that all rise again from death prove also that at the general resurrection all will rise again from ashes, unless the contrary, such as the hastening of their resurrection, be vouchsafed to certain persons by a special privilege of grace. For just as holy writ foretells the resurrection, so does it foretell the reformation of bodies (Phil. 3:21). And thus it follows that even as all die that the bodies of all may be able truly to rise again, so will the bodies of all perish that they may be able to be reformed. For just as death was inflicted by Divine justice as a punishment on man, so was the decay of the body, as appears from Gen. 3:19:
> Earth thou art and into earth shalt thou go (Vulg., — Dust thou art and into dust thou shalt return).

Moreover the order of nature requires the dissolution not only of the union of soul and body, but also of the mingling of the elements; even as vinegar cannot be brought back to the quality of wine unless it first be dissolved into the prejacent matter, for the mingling of the elements is both caused and preserved by the movement of the heaven, and when this ceases all mixed bodies will be dissolved into pure elements.

Reply Obj. 1. Christ’s resurrection is the exemplar of ours as to the term to which, but not as to the term from which.

Reply Obj. 2. By ashes we mean all the remains that are left after the dissolution of the body,—for two reasons. First, because it was the common custom in olden times to burn the bodies of the dead, and to keep the ashes, and so it became customary to speak of the remains of a human body as ashes. Secondly, on account of the cause of dissolution, which is the flame of the *fomes* by which the human body is radically infected. Hence, in order to be cleansed of this infection the human body must be dissolved into its primary components, and when a thing is destroyed by fire it is said to be reduced to ashes. Therefore the name of ashes is given to those things into which the human body is dissolved.

Reply Obj. 3. The fire that will cleanse the face of the earth will be able to reduce suddenly to ashes the bodies of those that will be found living, even as it will dissolve other mixed bodies into their prejacent matter.

Reply Obj. 4. Movement does not take its species from its term from which but from its term to which. Hence the resurrection of the saints, which will be glorious must differ from the resurrection of the wicked, which will not be glorious, in respect of the term to which, and not in respect of the term from which. And it often happens that the term to which is not the same, whereas the term from which is the same,—for instance, a thing may be moved from blackness to whiteness and to pallor.

### Article 3. Whether the Ashes from Which the Human Body Will Be Restored Have Any Natural Inclination towards the Soul Which Will Be United to Them?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the ashes from which the human body will be restored will have a natural inclination towards the soul which will be united to them.

Objection 1. For if they had no inclination towards the soul, they would stand in the same relation to that soul as other ashes. Therefore it would make no difference whether the body that is to be united to that soul were restored from those ashes or from others, and this is false.

Obj. 2. Further, the body is more dependent on the soul than the soul on the body. Now the soul separated from the body is still somewhat dependent on the body, and therefore its movement towards God is retarded on account of its desire for the body, as Augustine says (*Gen. ad Lit.* xii, 35).^1 Much more, therefore, has the body when separated from the soul a natural inclination towards that soul.

Obj. 3. Further, it is written (Job 20:11):
> His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust.
But vices are only in the soul. Therefore there will still remain in those ashes a natural inclination towards the soul.

On the contrary, the human body can be dissolved into the very elements, or it can be changed into the flesh of other animals. But the elements are homogeneous, and so is the flesh of a lion or other animal. Since then in the other parts of the elements or animals there is no natural inclination to that soul, neither will there be an inclination towards the soul in those parts into which the human body has been changed. This is made evident on the authority of Augustine (*Enchir.* lxxxviii):^2
> “The human body, although changed into the substance of other bodies or even into the elements, although it has become the food and flesh of any animals whatsoever, even of man, will in an instant return to that soul which previously animated it, and made it a living and growing man.”

Further, to every natural inclination there corresponds a natural agent; otherwise nature would fail in necessaries. Now the aforesaid ashes cannot be reunited to the same soul by any natural agent. Therefore there is not in them any natural inclination to the aforesaid reunion.

I answer that, opinion is threefold on this point. For some say that the human body is never dissolved into its very elements, and so there always remains in the ashes a certain force besides the elements, which gives a natural inclination to the same soul. But this assertion is in contradiction with the authority of Augustine quoted above (Arg. on the contrary, 1), as well as with the senses and reason, since whatever is composed of contraries can be dissolved into its component parts. And so others say that these parts of the elements into which the human body is dissolved retain more light, through having been united to the soul, and for this reason have a natural inclination to human souls. But this again is nonsensical, since the parts of the elements are of the same nature and have an equal share of light and darkness. Hence we must say differently that in those ashes there is no natural inclination to resurrection, but only by the ordering of Divine providence, which decreed that those ashes should be reunited to the soul; it is on this account that those parts of the elements shall be reunited and not others.

Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.

Reply Obj. 2. The soul separated from the body remains in the same nature that it has when united to the body. It is not so with the body, and consequently the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 3. These words of Job do not mean that the vices actually remain in the ashes of the dead, but that they remain according to the ordering of Divine justice, whereby those ashes are destined to the restoration of the body which will suffer eternally for the sins committed.

## Question LXXIX: Of the Conditions of Those Who Rise Again, and First, of Their Identity

### (In Three Articles)

In the next place we must consider the conditions of those who rise again. Here we shall consider:

1.  Those which concern the good and wicked in common;
2.  Those which concern the good only (Q. 82);
3.  Those which concern only the wicked (Q. 86).

Three things concern the good and wicked in common, namely their identity, their integrity, and their quality, and we shall inquire:

1.  About their identity;
2.  About their integrity (Q. 80);
3.  About their quality (Q. 81).

Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:

1.  Whether the body will rise again identically the same?
2.  Whether it will be the selfsame man?
3.  Whether it is necessary that the same ashes should return to the same parts in which they were before?

### Article 1. Whether in the Resurrection the Soul Will Be Reunited to the Same Identical Body?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the soul will not be reunited to the same identical body at the resurrection.

Objection 1. For
> thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare grain (1 Cor. 15:37).
Now the Apostle is there comparing death to sowing and resurrection to fructifying. Therefore

# Supplement

## Question LXXIX
### Article 1. Whether the Same Body Will Rise Again?

Obj. 1. For the same body that is laid aside in death is not resumed at the resurrection.

Obj. 2. Further, To every form some matter is adapted according to its condition, and likewise to every agent some instrument. Now the body is compared to the soul as matter to form, and as instrument to agent. Since then at the resurrection the soul will not be of the same condition as now (for it will be either entirely borne away to the heavenly life to which it adhered while living in the world, or will be cast down into the life of the brutes, if it lived as a brute in this world) it would seem that it will not resume the same body, but either a heavenly or a brutish body.

Obj. 3. Further, After death, as stated above (q. lxxviii, a. 3), the human body is dissolved into the elements. Now these elemental parts into which the human body has been dissolved do not agree with the human body dissolved into them, except in primary matter, even as any other elemental parts agree with that same body. But if the body were to be formed from those other elemental parts, it would not be described as identically the same. Therefore neither will it be the selfsame body if it be restored from these parts.

Obj. 4. Further, There cannot be numerical identity where there is numerical distinction of essential parts. Now the form of the mixed body, which form is an essential part of the human body, as being its form, cannot be resumed in numerical identity. Therefore the body will not be identically the same. The minor is proved thus: That which passes away into complete non-being cannot be resumed in identity. This is clear from the fact that there cannot be identity where there is distinction of being, and existence, which is the act of a being, is differentiated by being interrupted, as is any interrupted act. Now the form of a mixed body passes away into complete non-being by death, since it is a bodily form, and so also do the contrary qualities from which the mixture results. Therefore the form of a mixed body does not return in identity.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 19. 26):
> In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour (Vulg.,—my God),
where he is speaking of the vision after the resurrection, as appears from the preceding words:
> In the last day I shall rise out of the earth.
Therefore the selfsame body will rise again.

Further, Damascene says (*De Fide Orthodoxa* IV, 27)[^1]:
> “Resurrection is the second rising of that which has fallen.”
But the body which we have now fell by death. Therefore it will rise again the same identically.

I answer that, On this point the philosophers erred and certain modern heretics err. For some of the philosophers allowed that souls separated from bodies are reunited to bodies, yet they erred in this in two ways. First, as to the mode of reunion, for some held the separated soul to be naturally reunited to a body by the way of generation. Secondly, as to the body to which it was reunited, for they held that this second union was not with the selfsame body that was laid aside in death, but with another, sometimes of the same, sometimes of a different species. Of a different species when the soul while existing in the body had led a life contrary to the ordering of reason, so that it passed after death from the body of a man into the body of some other animal to whose manner of living it had conformed in this life, for instance into the body of a dog on account of lust, into the body of a lion on account of robbery and violence, and so forth,—and into a body of the same species when the soul has led a good life in the body, and having after death experienced some happiness, after some centuries began to wish to return to the body; and thus it was reunited to a human body.

But this opinion arises from two false sources. The first of these is that they said that the soul is not united to the body essentially as form to matter, but only accidentally, as mover to the thing moved, or as a man to his clothes. Hence it was possible for them to maintain that the soul pre-existed before being infused into the body begotten of natural generation, as also that it is united to various bodies. The second is that they held intellect not to differ from sense except accidentally, so that man would be said to surpass other animals in intelligence because the sensitive power is more acute in him on account of the excellence of his bodily make-up; and hence it was possible for them to assert that man's soul passes into the soul of a brute animal, especially when the human soul has been habituated to brutish actions. But these two sources are refuted by the Philosopher[^2], and in consequence of these being refuted, it is clear that the above opinion is false.

In like manner the errors of certain heretics are refuted. Some of them fell into the above opinions of the philosophers, while others held that souls are reunited to heavenly bodies, or again to bodies subtle as the wind, as Gregory relates of a certain Bishop of Constantinople, in his exposition of Job 19. 26, *In my flesh I shall see my God*, etc.[^3] Moreover these same errors of heretics may be refuted by the fact that they are prejudicial to the truth of resurrection as witnessed to by Holy Writ. For we cannot call it resurrection unless the soul return to the same body, since resurrection is a second rising, and the same thing rises that falls; therefore resurrection regards the body which after death falls, rather than the soul which after death lives. And consequently if it is not the same body which the soul resumes, it will not be a resurrection, but rather the assuming of a new body.

Reply Obj. 1. A comparison does not apply to every particular, but to some. For in the sowing of grain, the grain sown and the grain that is born of it are neither identical nor of the same condition, since it was first sown without a husk, yet is born with one; and the body will rise again identically the same, but of a different condition, since it was mortal and will rise in immortality.

Reply Obj. 2. The soul rising again and the soul living in this world differ not in essence but in respect of glory and misery, which is an accidental difference. Hence it follows that the body in rising again differs, not in identity, but in condition, so that a difference of bodies corresponds proportionally to the difference of souls.

Reply Obj. 3. That which is understood as though it were in matter before its form remains in matter after corruption, because when that which comes afterwards is removed that which came before may yet remain. Now, as the Commentator observes on the *First Book of Physics*[^4] and in *De Substantia Orbis*[^5], in the matter of things subject to generation and corruption, we must presuppose undeterminate dimensions, by reason of which matter is divisible, so as to be able to receive various forms in its various parts. Therefore after the separation of the substantial form from matter, these dimensions still remain the same, and consequently the matter existing under those dimensions, whatever form it receive, is more identified with that which was generated from it than any other part of matter existing under any form whatever. Thus the matter that will be brought back to restore the human body will be the same as that body’s previous matter.

Reply Obj. 4. Even as a simple quality is not the substantial form of an element, but its proper accident, and the disposition whereby its matter is rendered proper to such a form, so the form of a mixed body, which form is a quality resulting from simple qualities reduced to a mean, is not the substantial form of the mixed body, but its proper accident, and the disposition whereby the matter is in need of the form. Now the human body has no substantial form besides this form of the mixed body, except the rational soul, for if it had any previous substantial form, this would give it substantial being, and would establish it in the genus of substance, so that the soul would be united to a body already established in the genus of substance, and thus the soul would be compared to the body as artificial forms are to their matter, in respect of their being established in the genus of substance by their matter. Hence the union of the soul to the body would be accidental, which is the error of the ancient philosophers refuted by the Philosopher.[^6] It would also follow that the human body and each of its parts would not retain their former names in the same sense, which is contrary to the teaching of the Philosopher.[^7] Therefore since the rational soul remains, no substantial form of the human body falls away into complete non-being. And the variation of accidental forms does not make a difference of identity. Therefore the selfsame body will rise again, since the selfsame matter is resumed as stated in a previous reply.

## Article 2. Whether It Will Be Identically the Same Man That Shall Rise Again?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that it will not be identically the same man that shall rise again.

Objection 1. For according to the Philosopher[^1]: “Whatsoever things are changed in their corruptible substance are not repeated identically.” Now such is man’s substance in his present state. Therefore after the change wrought by death the selfsame man cannot be repeated.

Obj. 2. Further, Where there is a distinction of human nature there is not the same identical man; hence Socrates and Plato are two men and not one man, since each has his own distinct human nature. Now the human nature of one who rises again is distinct from that which he has now. Therefore he is not the same identical man. The minor can be proved in two ways. First, because human nature which is the form of the whole is not both form and substance as the soul is, but is a form only. Now such forms pass away into complete non-being, and consequently they cannot be restored. Secondly, because human nature results from union of parts. Now the same identical union as that which existed previously cannot be resumed, because repetition is opposed to identity, since repetition implies number, whereas identity implies unity, and these are incompatible with one another. But resurrection is a repeated union; therefore the union is not the same, and consequently there is not the same human nature nor the same man.

Obj. 3. Further, One same man is not several animals; therefore if it is not the same animal it is not the same identical man. Now where sense is not the same, there is not the same animal, since animal is defined from the primary sense, namely touch, as appears from the book on the *Soul*[^2]. But sense, as it does not remain in the separated soul (as some maintain), cannot be resumed in identity. Therefore the man who rises again will not be the same identical animal, and consequently he will not be the same man.

Obj. 4. Further, The matter of a statue ranks higher in the statue than the matter of a man does in man, because artificial things belong to the genus of substance by reason of their matter, but natural things by reason of their form, as appears from the Philosopher[^3], and again from the Commentator (*De Anima*, II)[^4]. But if a statue is remade from the same brass, it will not be the same identically. Therefore much less will it be identically the same man if he be reformed from the same ashes.

On the contrary, It is written (Job 19. 27):
> Whom I myself shall see . . . and not another,
and he is speaking of the vision after the resurrection. Therefore the same identical man will rise again.

Further, Augustine says (*De Trinitate* VIII, 5)[^5]:
> that “to rise again is nothing else but to live again.”
Now unless the same identical man that died return to life, he would not be said to live again. Therefore he would not rise again, which is contrary to faith.

I answer that, The necessity of holding the resurrection arises from this,—that man may obtain the last end for which he was made, for this cannot be accomplished in this life, nor in the life of the separated soul, as stated above (q. lxxv, aa. 1, 2); otherwise man would have been made in vain, if he were unable to obtain the end for which he was made. And since it is necessary for the end to be obtained by the selfsame thing that was made for that end, lest it appear to be made without purpose, it is necessary for the selfsame man to rise again; and this is effected by the selfsame soul being united to the selfsame body. For otherwise there would be no resurrection properly speaking, if the same man were not reformed. Hence to maintain that he who rises again is not the selfsame man is heretical, since it is contrary to the truth of Scripture which proclaims the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 1. The Philosopher is speaking of repetition by movement or natural change. For he shows the difference between the recurrence that occurs in generation and corruption and that which is observed in the movement of the heavens. Because the selfsame heaven by local movement returns to the beginning of its movement, since it has a moved incorruptible substance. On the other hand, things subject to generation and corruption return by generation to specific but not numerical identity, because from man blood is engendered, from blood seed, and so on until a man is begotten, not the selfsame man, but the same specifically. In like manner from fire comes air, from air water, from water earth, from which fire is produced, not the selfsame fire, but the same in species. Hence it is clear that the argument, so far as the meaning of the Philosopher is concerned, is not to the point.

We may also reply that the form of other things subject to generation and corruption is not subsistent of itself, so as to be able to remain after the corruption of the composite, as it is with the rational soul. For the soul, even after separation from the body, retains the being which accrues to it when in the body, and the body is made to share that being by the resurrection, since the being of the body and the being of the soul in the body are not distinct from one another, otherwise the union of soul and body would be accidental. Consequently there has been no interruption in the substantial being of man, such as would make it impossible for the selfsame man to return on account of an interruption in his being, as is the case with other things that are corrupted, the being of which is interrupted altogether, since their form does not remain, and their matter remains under another being. Nevertheless neither does the selfsame man recur by natural generation, because the body of the man begotten is not composed of the whole body of his begetter; hence his body is numerically distinct, and consequently his soul and the whole man.

Reply Obj. 2. There are two opinions about humanity and about any form of a whole. For some say that the form of the whole and the form of the part are really one and the same, but that it is called the form of the part according as it perfects the matter, and the form of the whole according as the whole specific nature results from it. According to this opinion humanity is really nothing else than the rational soul, and so, since the selfsame rational soul is resumed, there will be the same identical humanity, which will remain even after death, although not under the aspect of humanity, because the composite does not derive the specific nature from a separated humanity.

The other opinion, which seems nearer the truth, is Avicenna’s[^6], according to whom the form of the whole is not the form of a part only, nor some other form besides the form of the part, but is the whole resulting from the composition of form and matter, embracing both within itself. This form of the whole is called the essence or quiddity. Since then at the resurrection there will be the selfsame body and the selfsame rational soul, there will be of necessity, the same humanity. The first argument proving that there will be a distinction of humanity was based on the supposition that humanity is some distinct form, supervening upon form and matter. And this is false. And the second reason does not disprove the identity of humanity, because union implies action or passion, and though there be a different union, this cannot prevent the identity of humanity, because the action and passion from which humanity resulted are not of the essence of humanity, and so a distinction on their part does not involve a distinction of humanity, for it is clear that generation and resurrection are not the selfsame movement. Yet the identity of the rising man with the begotten man is not hindered for this reason, and in like manner neither is the identity of humanity prevented, if we take union for the relation itself, because this relation is not essential to but concomitant with humanity, since humanity is not one of those forms that are composition or order[^7], as are the forms of things produced by art, so that if there be another distinct composition there is another distinct form of a house.

Reply Obj. 3. This argument affords a very good proof against those who held a distinction between the sensitive and rational souls in man, because in that case the sensitive soul in man would not be incorruptible, as neither is it in other animals; and consequently in the resurrection there would not be the same sensitive soul, and consequently neither the same animal nor the same man. But if we assert that in man the same soul is by its substance both rational and sensitive, we shall encounter no difficulty in this question, because animal is defined from sense, that is, the sensitive soul as from its essential form; but from the sense which means the sensitive power, we know its definition as from an accidental form that contributes more than any other to our knowledge of the quiddity.[^8] Accordingly after death there remains the sensitive soul, even as the rational soul, according to its substance; but the sensitive powers, according to some, do not remain. And since these powers are accidental properties, diversity on their part cannot prevent the identity of the whole animal, not even of the animal’s parts; nor are powers to be called perfections or acts of organs unless as principles of action, as heat in fire.

Reply Obj. 4. A statue may be considered in two ways, either as a particular substance, or as something artificial. And since it is placed in the genus of substance by reason of its matter, it follows that if we consider it as a particular substance, it is the selfsame statue that is remade from the same matter. On the other hand, it is placed in the genus of artificial things according as it has an accidental form which, if the statue be destroyed, passes away also. Consequently it does not return identically the same, nor can the statue be identically the same. But man’s form, namely the soul, remains after the body has perished. Therefore the comparison fails.

## Article 3. Whether the Ashes of the Human Body Must, by the Resurrection, Return to the Same Parts of the Body That Were Dissolved Into Them?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem necessary for the ashes of the human body to return, by the resurrection, to the same parts that were dissolved into them.

Objection 1. For, according to the Philosopher[^1], “as the whole soul is to the whole body, so is a part of the soul to a part of the body, as sight to the pupil.” Now it is necessary that after the resurrection the body be resumed by the same soul. Therefore it is also necessary for the same parts of the body to return to the same limbs, in which they were perfected by the same parts of the soul.

Obj. 2. Further, Difference of matter causes difference of identity. But if the ashes do not return to the same parts, each part will not be remade from the same matter of which it consisted before. Therefore they will not be the same identically. Now if the parts are different the whole will also be different, since parts are to the whole as matter is to form.[^2] Therefore it will not be the selfsame man, which is contrary to the truth of the resurrection.

Obj. 3. Further, The resurrection is directed to the end that man may receive the wages of his works. Now different parts of the body are employed in different works, whether of merit or of demerit. Therefore at the resurrection each part must return to its former state that it may be rewarded in due measure.

On the contrary, Artificial things are more dependent on their matter than natural things. Now in artificial things, in order that the same artificial thing be remade from the same matter, there is no need for the parts to be brought back to the same position. Neither therefore is it necessary in man.

Further, Change of an accident does not cause a change of identity. Now the situation of parts is an accident. Therefore its change in a man does not cause a change of identity.

I answer that, In this question it makes a difference whether we ask what can be done without prejudice to identity, and what will be done for the sake of what is fitting. As regards the first it must be observed that in man we may speak of parts in two ways: first as of the various parts of a homogeneous whole for instance the various parts of flesh, or the various parts of bone; secondly, as of various parts of various species of a heterogeneous whole, for instance bone and flesh. Accordingly if it be said that one part of matter will return to another part of the same species, this causes no change except in the position of the parts, and change of position of parts does not change the species in homogeneous wholes; and so if the matter of one part return to another part, this is in no way prejudicial to the identity of the whole. Thus is it in the example given in the text (iv. Sent. d. 44)[^3], because a statue, after being remade, is identically the same, not as to its form, but as to its matter, in respect of which it is a particular substance, and in this way a statue is homogeneous, although it is not according to its artificial form.

But if it be said that the matter of one part returns to another part of another species, it follows of necessity that there is a change not only in the position of parts, but also in their identity, yet so that the whole matter, or something belonging to the truth of human nature in one is transferred to another; but not if what was superfluous in one part is transferred to another. Now the identity of parts being taken away, the identity of the whole is removed, if we speak of essential parts, but not if we speak of accidental parts, such as hair and nails, to which apparently Augustine refers.[^4] It is thus clear how the transference of matter from one part to another destroys the identity, and how it does not.

But speaking of what is fitting, it is more probable that even the parts will retain their position at the resurrection, especially as regards the essential and organic parts, although perhaps not as regards the accidental parts, such as nails and hair.

Reply Obj. 1. This argument considers organic or heterogeneous parts, but not homogeneous or like parts.

Reply Obj. 2. A change in the position of the parts of matter does not cause a change of identity, although difference of matter does.

Reply Obj. 3. Operation, properly speaking, is not ascribed to the part but to the whole, and therefore the reward is due not to the part but to the whole.

## QUESTION LXXX
### Of the integrity of the bodies in the resurrection
(In Five Articles)

We must next consider the integrity of the bodies in the resurrection. Under this head there are five points of inquiry:
1.  Whether all the members of the human body will rise again in the resurrection?
2.  Whether the hair and nails will?
3.  Whether the humours will?
4.  Whether whatever the body contained belonging to the truth of human nature will rise again?
5.  Whether whatever it contained materially will rise again?

### Article 1. Whether All the Members of the Human Body Will Rise Again?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that not all the members of the human body will rise again.

Objection 1. For if the end be done away it is useless to restore the means. Now the end of each member is its act. Since then nothing useless is done in the Divine works, and since the use of certain members is not fitting to man after the resurrection, especially the use of the genital members, for then they shall neither marry, nor be married (Matt. 22. 30), it would seem that not all the members shall rise again.

Obj. 2. Further, The entrails are members, and yet they will not rise again. For they can neither rise full, since thus they contain impurities, nor empty, since nothing is empty in nature. Therefore the members shall not all rise again.

Obj. 3. Further, The body shall rise again that it may be rewarded for the works which the soul did through it. Now the member of which a thief has been deprived for theft, and who has afterwards done penance and is saved, cannot be rewarded at the resurrection, neither for any good deed, since it has not co-operated in any, nor for evil deeds, since the punishment of the member would redound to the punishment of the man. Therefore the members will not all rise again with man.

On the contrary, The other members belong more to the truth of human nature than hair and nails. Yet these will be restored to man at the resurrection according to the text (iv. Sent. d. 44)[^1]. Much more therefore does this apply to the other members.

Further, The works of God are perfect (Deut. 32. 4). But the resurrection will be the work of God. Therefore man will be remade perfect in all his members.

I answer that, As stated in the book on the *Soul*[^2], the soul stands in relation to the body not only as its form and end, but also as efficient cause. For the soul is compared to the body as art to the thing made by art, as the Philosopher says[^3], and whatever is shown forth

[^1]: Lombard (*Sentences*, IV, d. 44) (QR II, 1001).
[^2]: *De Anima* II, 1 (412a21); III, 3 (414b31).
[^3]: Aristotle, *De Anima* II, 1 (412a21); III, 3 (414b31).

explicitly in the product of art is all contained implicitly and originally in the art. In like manner whatever appears in the parts of the body is all contained originally and, in a way, implicitly in the soul. Thus just as the work of an art would not be perfect if its product lacked any of the things contained in the art, so neither could man be perfect, unless the whole that is contained enfolded in the soul be outwardly unfolded in the body, nor would the body correspond in full proportion to the soul. Since then at the resurrection man’s body must correspond entirely to the soul, for it will not rise again except according to the relation it bears to the rational soul, it follows that man also must rise again perfect, seeing that he is thereby repaired in order that he may obtain his ultimate perfection. Consequently all the members that are now in man’s body must be restored at the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 1. The members may be considered in two ways in relation to the soul: either according to the relation of matter to form, or according to the relation of instrument to agent, since the whole body is compared to the whole soul in the same way as one part is to another.[^1] If then the members be considered in the light of the first relationship, their end is not operation, but rather the perfect being of the species, and this is also required after the resurrection; but if they be considered in the light of the second relationship, then their end is operation. And yet it does not follow that when the operation fails the instrument is useless, because an instrument serves not only to accomplish the operation of the agent, but also to show its power. Hence it will be necessary for the virtue of the soul’s powers to be shown in their bodily instruments, even though they never proceed to action, so that the wisdom of God be thereby glorified.

Reply Obj. 2. The entrails will rise again in the body even as the other members, and they will be filled not with vile superfluities but with humours of an excellent kind.

Reply Obj. 3. The acts by which we merit are not the acts, properly speaking, of hand or foot but of the whole man, even as the work of art is ascribed not to the instrument but to the craftsman. Therefore though the member which was cut off before a man’s repentance did not co-operate with him in the state in which he merits glory, yet man himself merits that the whole man may be rewarded, who with his whole being serves God.

## Article 2. Whether the Hair and Nails Will Rise Again in the Human Body?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the hair and nails will not rise again in the human body.

Objection 1. For just as hair and nails result from the surplus of food, so do urine, sweat and other superfluities or dregs. But these will not rise again with the body. Neither therefore will hair and nails.

Obj. 2. Further, Of all the superfluities that are produced from food, seed comes nearest to the truth of human nature, since though superfluous it is needed. Yet seed will not rise again in the human body. Much less therefore will hair and nails.

Obj. 3. Further, Nothing is perfected by a rational soul that is not perfected by a sensitive soul. But hair and nails are not perfected by a sensitive soul, for we do not feel with them according to the book on the Soul.[^2] Therefore since the human body rises not again except because it is perfected by a rational soul, it would seem that the hair and nails will not rise again.

On the contrary, it is written (Luke 21:18):
> A hair of your head shall not perish.

Further, Hair and nails were given to man as an ornament. Now the bodies of men, especially of the elect ought to rise again with all their adornment. Therefore they ought to rise again with the hair.

I answer that, The soul is to the animated body as art is to the work of art, and is to the parts of the body as art to its instruments; and so an animated body is called an “organic” body.[^3] Now art employs certain instruments for the accomplishment of the work intended, and these instruments belong to the primary intention of art, and it also uses other instruments for the safe-keeping of the principal instruments, and these belong to the secondary intention of art; thus the art of warfare employs a sword for fighting, and a sheath for the safe-keeping of the sword. And so among the parts of an animated body, some are directed to the accomplishment of the soul’s operations, for instance the heart, liver, hand, foot, while others are directed to the safe-keeping of the other parts as leaves to cover fruit; and thus hair and nails are in man for the protection of other parts. Consequently, although they do not belong to the primary perfection of the human body, they belong to the secondary perfection, and since man will rise again with all the perfections of his nature, it follows that hair and nails will rise again in him.

Reply Obj. 1. Those superfluities are voided by nature as being useful for nothing. Hence they do not belong to the perfection of the human body. It is not so with those superfluities which nature reserves for the production of hair and nails which she needs for the protection of the members.

Reply Obj. 2. Seed is not required for the perfection of the individual, as hair and nails are, but only for the perfection of the species.

Reply Obj. 3. Hair and nails are nourished and grow, and so it is clear that they share in some operation, which would not be possible unless they were parts in some way perfected by the soul. And since in man there is but one soul, namely the rational soul, it is clear that they are perfected by the rational soul, although not so far as to share in the operation of sense, as neither do bones, and yet it is certain that these will rise again and that they belong to the integrity of the individual.

## Article 3. Whether the Humours Will Rise Again in the Body?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the humours will not rise again in the body.

Objection 1. For it is written (1 Cor. 15:50):
> Flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God.
Now blood is the chief humour. Therefore it will not rise again in the blessed, who will possess the kingdom of God, and much less in others.

Obj. 2. Further, Humours are intended to make up for waste. Now after the resurrection there will be no waste. Therefore the body will not rise again with humours.

Obj. 3. Further, That which is in process of generation in the human body is not yet perfected by the rational soul. Now the humours are still in process of generation because they are potentially flesh and bone. Therefore they are not yet perfected by the rational soul. Now the human body is not directed to the resurrection except in so far as it is perfected by the rational soul. Therefore the humours will not rise again.

On the contrary, Whatever enters into the constitution of the human body will rise again with it. Now this applies to the humours, as appears from the statement of Augustine (*De Spiritu et Anima*, xv)[^4] that:
> The body consists of functional members; the functional members of homogeneous parts; and the homogeneous parts of humours.
Therefore the humours will rise again in the body.

Further, Our resurrection will be conformed to the resurrection of Christ. Now in Christ’s resurrection His blood rose again; otherwise the wine would not now be changed into His blood in the Sacrament of the altar. Therefore the blood will rise again in us also, and in like manner the other humours.

I answer that, Whatever belongs to the integrity of human nature in those who take part in the resurrection will rise again, as stated above (aa. 1, 2). Hence whatever humidity of the body belongs to the integrity of human nature must rise again in man. Now there is a threefold humidity in man. There is one which occurs as receding from the perfection of the individual,—either because it is on the way to corruption, and is voided by nature, for instance urine, sweat, matter, and so forth,—or because it is directed by nature to the preservation of the species in some individual, either by the act of the generative power, as seed, or by the act of the nutritive power, as milk. None of these humidities will rise again, because they do not belong to the perfection of the person rising again.

The second kind of humidity is one that has not yet reached its ultimate perfection, which nature achieves in the individual, yet it is directed to it by nature; and this is of two kinds. For there is one kind that has a definite form and is contained among the parts of the body, for instance the blood and the other humours which nature has directed to the members that are produced or nourished from them, and yet they have certain definite forms like the other parts of the body, and consequently will rise again with the other parts of the body. But another kind of humidity is in transition from form to form, namely from the form of humour to the form of member. Humidities of this kind will not rise again, because after the resurrection each part of the body will be established in its form, so that one will not pass into another. Therefore this humidity that is actually in transition from one form to another will not rise again. Now this humidity may be considered in a twofold state,—either as being at the beginning of its transformation, and thus it is called *ros*, namely the humidity that is found in the cavities of the smaller veins,—or as in the course of transformation and already beginning to undergo alteration, and thus it is called *cambium*; but in neither state will it rise again. The third kind of humidity is that which has already reached its ultimate perfection that nature intends in the body of the individual, and has already undergone transformation and become incorporate with the members. This is called *gluten*, and since it belongs to the substance of the members it will rise again just as the members will.

Reply Obj. 1. In these words of the Apostle flesh and blood do not denote the substance of flesh and blood but deeds of flesh and blood, which are either deeds of sin or the operations of the animal life. Or we may say with Augustine in his letter to Consentius[^5] that flesh and blood here signify the corruption which is now predominant in flesh and blood; hence the Apostle’s words continue:
> Neither shall corruption possess incorruption.

Reply Obj. 2. Just as the members that serve for generation will be after the resurrection for the integrity of human nature, and not for the operation accomplished now by them, so will the humours be in the body not to make up for waste, but to restore the integrity of human nature and to show forth its natural power.

Reply Obj. 3. Just as the elements are in the course of generation in relation to mixed bodies, because they are their matter, yet not so as to be always in transition when in the mixed body, so too are the humours in relation to the members. And for this reason as the elements in the parts of the universe have definite forms, by reason of which they, like mixed bodies, belong to the perfection of the universe, so too the humours belong to the perfection of the human body, just as the other parts do, although they do not reach its entire perfection, as the other parts do, and although the elements have not perfect forms as mixed bodies have. But as all the parts of the universe receive their perfection from God, not equally, but each one according to its mode, so too the humours are in some way perfected by the rational soul, yet not in the same measure as the more perfect parts.

## Article 4. Whether Whatever in the Body Belonged to the Truth of Human Nature Will Rise Again in It?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that what was in the body, belonging to the truth of human nature will not all rise again in it.

Objection 1. For food is changed into the truth of human nature. Now sometimes the flesh of the ox or of other animals is taken as food. Therefore if whatever belonged to the truth of human nature will rise again, the flesh of the ox or of other animals will also rise again, which cannot be admitted.

Obj. 2. Further, Adam’s rib belonged to the truth of human nature in him, as ours does in us. But Adam’s rib will rise again not in Adam but in Eve, for otherwise Eve would not rise again at all since she was made from that rib. Therefore whatever belonged in man to the truth of human nature will not all rise again in him.

Obj. 3. Further, It is impossible for the same thing from different men to rise again. Yet it is possible for something in different men to belong to the truth of human nature, for instance if a man were to partake of human flesh which would be changed into his substance. Therefore there will not rise again in man whatever belonged in him to the truth of human nature.

Obj. 4. Further, If it be said that not all the flesh partaken of belongs to the truth of human nature, and that consequently some of it may possibly rise again in the one man and some in the other,—on the contrary: That which is derived from one’s parents would especially seem to belong to the truth of human nature. But if one who partook of nothing but human flesh were to beget children, that which his child derives from him must be of the flesh of other men partaken of by his father, since the seed is from the surplus of food, as the Philosopher proves.[^6] Therefore what belongs to the truth of human nature in that child belonged also to the truth of human nature in other men of whose flesh his father had partaken.

Obj. 5. Further, If it be said that what was changed into seed was not that which belonged to the truth of human nature in the flesh of the men eaten, but something not belonging to the truth of human nature.—on the contrary: Let us suppose that someone is fed entirely on embryos in which there seems to be nothing but what belongs to the truth of human nature, since whatever is in them is derived from the parents. If then the surplus food be changed into seed, that which belonged to the truth of human nature in the embryos—and after these have received a rational soul, the resurrection applies to them—must belong to the truth of human nature in the child begotten of that seed. And thus, since the same being cannot rise again in two subjects, it will be impossible for whatever belonged to the truth of human nature in both to rise again in both of them.

On the contrary, Whatever belonged to the truth of human nature was perfected by the rational soul. Now it is through being perfected by the rational soul that the human body is directed to the resurrection. Therefore whatever belonged to the truth of human nature will rise again in each one.

Further, If anything belonging to the truth of human nature in a man be taken from his body, this will not be the perfect body of a man. Now all imperfection of a man will be removed at the resurrection, especially in the elect, to whom it was promised (Luke 21:18) that not a hair of their head should perish. Therefore whatever belonged to the truth of human nature in a man will rise again in him.

I answer that, “Everything is related to truth in the same way as to being,”[^7] because a thing is true when it is as it appears to him who actually knows it. For this reason Avicenna says[^8] that “the truth of anything is a property of the being immutably attached to it.” Accordingly a thing is said to belong to the truth of human nature because it belongs properly to the being of human nature, and this is what shares the form of human nature, just as true gold is what has the true form of gold from which gold derives its proper being. In order therefore to see what it is that belongs to the truth of human nature, we must observe that there have been three opinions on that question. For some have maintained that nothing begins anew to belong to the truth of human nature, and that whatever belongs to the truth of human nature, all of it belonged to the truth of human nature when this was created; and that this multiplies by itself, so that it is possible for the seed of which the child is begotten to be detached from it by the begetter, and that again the detached part multiplies in the child, so that he reaches perfect quantity by growth, and so on; and that thus was the whole human race multiplied. Therefore according to this opinion, whatever is produced by nourishment, although it seem to have the appearance of flesh and blood, does not belong to the truth of human nature.

Others held that something new is added to the truth of human nature by the natural transformation of the food into the human body if we consider the truth of human nature in the species to the preservation of which the act of the generative power is directed, but that if we consider the truth of human nature in the individual, to the preservation and perfection of which the act of the nutritive power is directed, that which is added by food belongs to the truth of the human nature of the individual, not primarily but secondarily. For they assert that the truth of human nature, first and foremost, consists in the radical humour, that namely which is begotten of the seed of which the human race was originally fashioned, and that what is changed from food into true flesh and blood does not belong principally to the truth of human nature in this particular individual, but secondarily; and that nevertheless this can belong principally to the truth of human nature in another individual who is begotten of the seed of the former. For they assert that seed is the surplus from food, either mingled with something belonging principally to the truth of human nature in the begetter, according to some, or without any such admixture, as others maintain. And thus the nutrimental humour in one becomes the radical humour in another.

The third opinion is that something new begins to belong principally to the truth of human nature even in this individual, because distinction in the human body does not require that any signate material part needs to remain throughout the whole lifetime; any signate part one may take is indifferent to this, whereas it remains always as regards what belongs to the species in it, although as regards what is material in it, it may ebb and flow. And thus the nutrimental humour is not distinct from the radical on the part of its principle (so that it be called radical when begotten of the seed, and nutrimental when produced by the food), but rather on the part of the term, so that it be called radical when it reaches the term of generation by the act of the generative, or even nutritive power, but nutrimental when it has not yet reached this term, but is still on the way to give nourishment. These three opinions have been more fully exposed and examined in the *Sentences* (II Sent. d. 30, Q. 11, A. 1);[^9] therefore there is no need for repetition here, except in so far as the question at issue is concerned.

It must accordingly be observed that this question requires different answers according to these opinions. For the first opinion on account of its explanation of the process of multiplication is able to admit perfection of the truth of human nature, both as regards the number of individuals and as regards the due quantity of each individual, without taking into account that which is produced from food; for this is not added except for the purpose of resisting the destruction that might result from the action of natural heat, as lead is added to silver lest it be destroyed in melting. Therefore since at the resurrection human nature must be restored to its perfection, nor does the natural heat tend to destroy the natural humour, there will be no need for anything resulting from food to rise again in man, but that alone will rise again which belonged to the truth of the human nature of the individual, and this reaches the aforesaid perfection in number and quantity by being detached and multiplied.

The second opinion, since it maintains that what is produced from food is needed for the perfection of quantity in the individual and for the multiplication that results from generation, has to admit that something of this product from food shall rise again; not all, however, but only so much as is required for the perfect restoration of human nature in all its individuals. Hence this opinion asserts that all that was in the substance of the seed will rise again in this man who was begotten of this seed, because this belongs chiefly to the truth of human nature in him, while of that which afterwards he derives from nourishment, only so much will rise again in him as is needed for the perfection of his quantity, and not all, because this does not belong to the perfection of human nature, except in so far as nature requires it for the perfection of quantity. Since however this nutrimental humour is subject to ebb and flow the restoration will be effected in this order, that what first belonged to the substance of a man’s body will all be restored, and of that which was added secondly, thirdly, and so on, as much as is required to restore quantity. This is proved by two reasons. First, because that which was added was intended to restore what was wasted at first, and thus it does not belong principally to the truth of human nature to the same extent as that which came first. Secondly, because the addition of extraneous humour to the first radical humour results in the whole mixture not sharing the truth of the specific nature as perfectly as the first did; and the Philosopher instances as an example[^10] the mixing of water with wine, which always weakens the strength of the wine, so that in the end the wine becomes watery, so that although the second water is drawn into the species of wine, it does not share the species of wine as perfectly as the first water added to the wine. Even so that which is secondly changed from food into flesh does not so perfectly attain to the species of flesh as that which was changed first, and consequently does not belong in the same degree to the truth of human nature nor to the resurrection. Accordingly it is clear that this opinion maintains that the whole of what belongs to the truth of human nature principally will rise again, but not the whole of what belongs to the truth of human nature secondarily.

The third opinion differs somewhat from the second and in some respects agrees with it. It differs in that it maintains that whatever is under the form of flesh and bone all belongs to the truth of human nature, because this opinion does not distinguish as remaining in man during his whole lifetime any signate matter that belongs essentially and primarily to the truth of human nature, besides something ebbing and flowing, that belongs to the truth of human nature merely on account of the perfection of quantity, and not on account of the primary being of the species, as the second opinion asserted. But it states that all the parts that are not beside the intention of the nature generated belong to the truth of human nature as regards what they have of the species, since thus they remain, but not as regards what they have of matter since thus they are indifferent to ebb and flow; so that we are to understand that the same thing happens in the parts of one man as in the whole population of a city, for each individual is cut off from the population by death, while others take their place; and so the parts of the people flow back and forth materially, but remain formally, since these others occupy the very same offices and positions from which the former were withdrawn, so that the commonwealth is said to remain the selfsame. In like manner, while certain parts are on the ebb and others are being restored to the same shape and position, all the parts flow back and forth as to their matter, but remain as to their species; and nevertheless the selfsame man remains.

On the other hand, the third opinion agrees with the second, because it holds that the parts which come secondly do not reach the perfection of the species so perfectly as those which come first, and consequently the third opinion asserts that the same thing rises again in man as the second opinion maintains, but not for quite the same reason. For it holds that the whole of what is produced from the seed will rise again, not because it belongs to the truth of human nature otherwise than that which comes after, but because it shares the truth of human nature more perfectly—which same order the second opinion applied to those things that are produced afterwards from food, in which point also these two opinions agree.

Reply Obj. 1. A natural thing is what it is, not from its matter but from its form; therefore, although that part of matter which at one time was under the form of bovine flesh rises again in man under the form of human flesh, it does not follow that the flesh of an ox rises again, but the flesh of a man; otherwise one might conclude that the clay from which Adam’s body was fashioned shall rise again. The second opinion, however, grants this argument.

Reply Obj. 2. That rib did not belong to the perfection of the individual in Adam, but was directed to the multiplication of the species. Hence it will rise again not in Adam but in Eve, just as the seed will rise again, not in the begetter, but in the begotten.

Reply Obj. 3. According to the first opinion it is easy to reply to this argument, because the flesh that is eaten never belonged to the truth of human nature in the eater, but it did belong to the truth of human nature in him whose flesh was eaten, and thus it will rise again in the latter but not in the former. But according to the second and third opinions, each one will rise again in that in which he approached nearest to the perfect participation of the power of the species, and if he approached equally in both, he will rise again in that in which he was first, because in that he first was directed to the resurrection by union with the rational soul of that man. Hence if there were any surplus in the flesh eaten not belonging to the truth of human nature in the first man, it will be possible for it to rise again in the second. Otherwise what belonged to the resurrection in the first will rise again in him and not in the second. But in the second its place is taken either

by something of that which was the product from other food, or if he never partook of any other food than human flesh, the substitution is made by Divine power so far as the perfection of quantity requires, as it does in those who die before the perfect age. Nor does this take away from numerical identity, as neither does the ebb and flow of parts.

Reply Obj. 4. According to the first opinion this argument is easily answered. For that opinion asserts that the seed is not from the surplus food, so that the flesh eaten is not changed into the seed of which the child is begotten. But according to the other two opinions we must reply that it is impossible for the whole of the flesh eaten to be changed into seed, because it is after much separation that the seed is distilled from the food, since seed is the ultimate surplus of food. That part of the eaten flesh which is changed into seed belongs to the truth of human nature in the one born of the seed more than in the one of whose flesh the seed was the product. Hence, according to the rule already laid down (Reply 3), whatever was changed into the seed will rise again in the person born of the seed, while the remaining matter will rise again in him of whose flesh the seed was the product.

Reply Obj. 5. The embryo is not concerned with the resurrection before it is animated by a rational soul, in which state much has been added to the seminal substance from the substance of food, since the child is nourished in the mother’s womb. Consequently on the supposition that a man partook of such food, and that someone were begotten of its surplus, that which was in the seminal substance will indeed rise again in the one begotten of that seed; unless it contain something that would have belonged to the seminal substance in those from whose flesh, when eaten, the seed was produced, for this would rise again in the first, but not in the second. The remainder of the eaten flesh, not being changed into seed, will clearly rise again in the first, the Divine power supplying deficiencies in both. The first opinion is not troubled by this objection, since it does not hold the seed to be from the surplus food, but there are many other reasons against it as may be seen in the *Second Book of the Sentences* (II, Sent. d. 30).[^1]

### Article 5. Whether Whatever Was Materially in a Man’s Members Will All Rise Again?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that whatever was materially in a man’s members will all rise again.

Objection 1. For the hair, it seems, is less concerned in the resurrection than the other members. Yet whatever was in the hair will all rise again, if not in the hair, at least in other parts of the body, as Augustine says, [^2] quoted in the text (IV, Sent. d. 44).[^3] Much more therefore whatever was materially in the other members will all rise again.

Obj. 2. Further, Just as the parts of the flesh are perfected as to species by the rational soul, so are the parts as to matter. But the human body is directed to the resurrection through being perfected by a rational soul. Therefore not only the parts of species but also the parts of matter will all rise again.

Obj. 3. Further, The body derives its totality from the same cause as it derives its divisibility into parts. But division into parts belongs to a body in respect of matter, the disposition of which is quantity, in respect of which it is divided. Therefore totality is ascribed to the body in respect of its parts of matter. If then all the parts of matter rise not again, neither will the whole body rise again, which cannot be admitted.

On the contrary, The parts of matter are not permanent in the body but ebb and flow, as stated in the book *On Generation and Corruption*.[^4] If, therefore, all the parts of matter rise again, either the body of one who rises again will be very dense, or it will be immoderate in quantity.

Further, whatever belongs to the truth of human nature in one man can all be a part of matter in another man, if the latter were to partake of his flesh. Therefore if all the parts of matter in one man were to rise again it follows that in one man there will rise again that which belongs to the truth of human nature in another, which is absurd.

I answer that, What is in man materially is not directed to the resurrection except in so far as it belongs to the truth of human nature, because it is in this respect that it bears a relation to the human souls. Now all that is in man materially belongs indeed to the truth of human nature in so far as it has something of the species, but not all, if we consider the totality of matter; because all the matter that was in a man from the beginning of his life to the end would surpass the quantity due to his species, as the third opinion states (a. 4), which opinion seems to me more probable than the others. Therefore the whole of what is in man will rise again, if we speak of the totality of the species which is dependent on quantity, shape, position and order of parts, but the whole will not rise again if we speak of the totality of matter.

The second and first opinions, however, do not make this distinction, but distinguish between parts both of which have the species and matter. But these two opinions agree in that they both state that what is produced from the seed will all rise again even if we speak of totality of matter, while they differ in this that the first opinion maintains that nothing will rise again of that which was engendered from food, while the second holds that something, but not all, of it will rise again, as stated above (a. 4).

Reply Obj. 1. Just as all that is in the other parts of the body will rise again, if we speak of the totality of the species, but not if we speak of material totality, so is it with the hair. In the other parts something accrues from nourishment which causes growth, and this is accounted as another part, if we speak of totality of species, since it occupies another place and position in the body, and is under other parts of dimension, and there accrues something which does not cause growth, but serves to make up for waste by nourishing; and this is not accounted as another part of the whole considered in relation to the species, since it does not occupy another place or position in the body than that which was occupied by the part that has passed away, although it may be accounted another part if we consider the totality of matter. The same applies to the hair. Augustine, however, is speaking of the cutting of hair that was a part causing growth of the body; therefore it must rise again, not however as regards the quantity of hair, lest it should be immoderate, but it will rise again in other parts as deemed expedient by Divine Providence. Or else he refers to the case when something will be lacking to the other parts, for then it will be possible for this to be supplied from the surplus of hair.

Reply Obj. 2. According to the third opinion parts of species are the same as parts of matter, for the Philosopher does not make this distinction[^5] in order to distinguish different parts, but in order to show that the same parts may be considered both in respect of species, as to what belongs to the form and species in them, and in respect of matter, as to that which is under the form and species. Now it is clear that the matter of the flesh has no relation to the rational soul except in so far as it is under such a form, and consequently by reason of it it is directed to the resurrection. But the first and second opinions which draw a distinction between parts of species and parts of matter say that although the rational soul perfects both parts, it does not perfect parts of matter except by means of the parts of species, and so they are not equally directed to the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 3. In the matter of things subject to generation and corruption it is necessary to presuppose indefinite dimensions before the reception of the substantial form. Consequently division which is made according to these dimensions belongs properly to matter. But complete and definite quantity comes to matter after the substantial form; therefore division that is made in reference to definite quantity regards the species especially when definite position of parts belongs to the essence of the species, as in the human body.

## QUESTION LXXXI
Of the quality of those who rise AGAIN
(In Four Articles)

We must now consider the quality of those who rise again. Under this head there are four points of inquiry: (1) Whether all will rise again in the youthful age? (2) Whether they will be of equal stature? (3) Whether all will be of the same sex? (4) Whether they will rise again to the animal life?

### Article 1. Whether All Will Rise Again of the Same Age?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that all will not rise again of the same, namely the youthful age.

Objection 1. Because God will take nothing pertaining to man’s perfection from those who rise again, especially from the blessed. Now age pertains to the perfection of man, since old age is the age that demands reverence. Therefore the old will not rise again of a youthful age.

Obj. 2. Further, Age is reckoned according to the length of past time. Now it is impossible for past time not to have passed. Therefore it is impossible for those who were of greater age to be brought back to a youthful age.

Obj. 3. Further, That which belonged most to the truth of human nature in each individual will especially rise again in him. Now the sooner a thing was in man the more would it seem to have belonged to the truth of human nature, because in the end, through the strength of the species being weakened the human body is likened to watery wine according to the Philosopher.[^6] Therefore if all are to rise again of the same age, it is more fitting that they should rise again in the age of childhood.

On the contrary, It is written (Eph. 4. 13): "Until we all meet . . . unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ." Now Christ rose again of youthful age, which begins about the age of thirty years, as Augustine says.[^7] Therefore others also will rise again of a youthful age.

Further, Man will rise again at the most perfect stage of nature. Now human nature is at the most perfect stage in the age of youth. Therefore all will rise again of that age.

I answer that, Man will rise again without any defect of human nature, because as God founded human nature without a defect, even so will He restore it without defect. Now human nature has a twofold defect. First, because it has not yet attained to its ultimate perfection. Secondly, because it has already gone back from its ultimate perfection. The first defect is found in children, the second in the aged, and consequently in each of these human nature will be brought by the resurrection to the state of its ultimate perfection which is in the youthful age, at which the movement of growth terminates, and from which the movement of decrease begins.

Reply Obj. 1. Old age calls for reverence not on account of the state of the body which is at fault, but on account of the soul’s wisdom which is taken for granted on account of its being advanced in years. Therefore in the elect there will remain the reverence due to old age on account of the fulness of Divine Wisdom which will be in them, but the defect of old age will not be in them.

Reply Obj. 2. We speak of age not as regards the number of years, but as regards the state which the human body acquires from years. Hence Adam is said to have been formed in the youthful age on account of the particular condition of body which he had at the first day of his formation. Thus the argument is not to the point.

Reply Obj. 3. The strength of the species is said to be more perfect in a child than in a young man, as regards the ability to transform nourishment in a certain way, even as it is more perfect in the seed than in the mature man. In youth, however, it is more perfect as regards the term of completion. Therefore that which belonged principally to the truth of human nature will be brought to that perfection which it has in the age of youth, and not to that perfection which it has in the age of a child, wherein the humours have not yet reached their ultimate disposition.

### Article 2. Whether All Will Rise Again of the Same Stature?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that all will rise again of the same stature.

Objection 1. For just as man is measured by dimensive quantity, so is he by the quantity of time. Now the quantity of time will be reduced to the same measure in all, since all will rise again of the same age. Therefore the dimensive quantity will also be reduced to the same measure in all, so that all will rise again of the same stature.

Obj. 2. Further, The Philosopher says[^8] that “all things of the same nature have a certain limit and measure of size and growth.” Now this limitation can only arise by virtue of the form, with which the quantity as well as all the other accidents ought to agree. Therefore since all men have the same specific form, there should be the same measure of quantity in respect of matter in all, unless an error should occur. But the error of nature will be set right at the resurrection. Therefore all will rise again of the same stature.

Obj. 3. Further, It will be impossible for man in rising again to be of a quantity proportionate to the natural power which first formed his body, for otherwise those who could not be brought to a greater quantity by the power of nature will never rise again of a greater quantity, which is false. Therefore that quantity must be proportionate to the power which will restore the human body by the resurrection, and to the matter from which it is restored. Now the self-same, namely the Divine power, will restore all bodies, and all the ashes from which the human bodies will be restored are equally disposed to receive the action of that power. Therefore the resurrection of all men will bring them to the same quantity, and so the same conclusion follows.

On the contrary, Natural quantity results from each individual’s nature. Now the nature of the individual will not be altered at the resurrection. Therefore neither will its natural quantity. But all are not of the same natural quantity. Therefore all will not rise again of the same stature.

Further, Human nature will not be restored by resurrection to glory or to punishment. But there will not be the same quantity of glory or punishment in all those who rise again. Neither therefore will there be the same quantity of stature.

I answer that, At the resurrection human nature will be restored not only in the selfsame species but also in the selfsame individual, and consequently we must observe in the resurrection what is requisite not only to the specific but also to the individual nature. Now the specific nature has a certain quantity which it neither exceeds nor fails without error, and yet this quantity has certain degrees of latitude and is not to be attached to one fixed measure; and each individual in the human species aims at some degree of quantity befitting his individual nature within the bounds of that latitude, and reaches it at the end of his growth, if there has been no error in the working of nature, resulting in the addition of something to or the subtraction of something from the aforesaid quantity, the measure of which is gauged according to the proportion of heat as expanding, and of humidity as expansive, in point of which all are not of the same power. Therefore all will not rise of the same quantity, but each one will rise again of that quantity which would have been his at the end of his growth if nature had not erred or failed, and the Divine Power will subtract or supply what was excessive or lacking in man.

Reply Obj. 1. It has already been explained (a. 1, Reply 2) that all are said to rise again of the same age, not as though the same length of time were befitting to each one, but because the same state of perfection will be in all, which state is indifferent to a great or small quantity.

Reply Obj. 2. The quantity of a particular individual corresponds not only to the form of the species, but also to the nature or matter of the individual; therefore the conclusion does not follow.

Reply Obj. 3. The quantity of those who will be raised from the dead is not proportionate to the restoring power, because the latter does not belong to the power of the body,—nor to the ashes, as to the state in which they are before the resurrection,—but to nature which the individual had at first. Nevertheless if the formative power on account of some defect was unable to effect the due quantity that is befitting to the species, the Divine Power will supply the defect at the resurrection, as in dwarfs, and in like manner in those who by immoderate size have exceeded the due bounds of nature.

### Article 3. Whether All Will Rise Again of the Male Sex?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that all will rise again of the male sex.

Objection 1. For it is written (Eph. 4. 13) that "we shall all meet unto a perfect man, etc." Therefore there will be none but the male sex.

Obj. 2. Further, In the world to come “all pre-eminence will cease,” as a gloss observes[^9] on I Cor. 15. 24. Now woman is subject to man in the natural order. Therefore women will rise again not in the female but in the male sex.

Obj. 3. Further, That which is produced incidentally and beside the intention of nature will not rise again, since all error will be removed at the resurrection. Now the female sex is produced beside the intention of nature, through a fault in the formative power of the seed, which is unable to bring the matter of the fetus to the male form; therefore the Philosopher says[^10] that the female is “a misbegotten male.” Therefore the female sex will not rise again.

On the contrary, Augustine says:[^11] “Those are wiser, it seems, who doubt not that both sexes will rise again.”

Further, At the resurrection God will restore man to what He made him at the creation. Now He made woman from the man’s rib (Gen. 2. 22). Therefore He will also restore the female sex at the resurrection.

I answer that, Just as, considering the nature of the individual, a different quantity is due to different men, so also, considering the nature of the individual, a different sex is due to different men. Moreover, this same diversity is becoming to the perfection of the species, the different degrees of which are filled by this very difference of sex and quantity. Therefore just as men will rise again of various stature, so will they rise again of different sex. And though there be difference of sex there will be no shame in seeing one another, since there will be no lust to invite them to shameful deeds which are the cause of shame.

Reply Obj. 1. When it is said that we shall all meet Christ unto a perfect man, this refers not to the male sex but to the strength of soul which will be in all, both men and women.

Reply Obj. 2. Woman is subject to man on account of the frailty of nature, as regards both vigour of soul and strength of body. After the resurrection, however, the difference in those points will be not on account of the difference of sex, but by reason of the difference of merits. Hence the conclusion does not follow.

Reply Obj. 3. Although the begetting of a woman is beside the intention of a particular nature, it is in the intention of universal nature, which requires both sexes for the perfection of the human species. Nor will any defect result from sex as stated above (Reply 2).

### Article 4. Whether All Will Rise Again to Animal Life?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that they will rise again to the animal life, or in other words that they will make use of the acts of the nutritive and generative powers.

Objection 1. For our resurrection will be conformed to Christ’s. But Christ is said to have eaten after His resurrection (John 21; Luke 24). Therefore, after the resurrection men will eat, and in like manner beget.

Obj. 2. Further, The distinction of sexes is directed to generation; and in like manner the instruments which serve the nutritive power are directed to eating. Now man will rise again with all these. Therefore he will exercise the acts of the generative and nutritive powers.

Obj. 3. Further, The whole man will be beatified both in soul and in body. Now beatitude or happiness, according to the Philosopher,[^12] consists in a perfect operation. Therefore it must be that all the powers of the soul and all the members have their respective acts after the resurrection. And so the same conclusion follows as above.

Obj. 4. Further, After the resurrection there will be perfect joy in the blessed. Now such a joy includes all pleasures, since happiness is a state rendered perfect by the accumulation of all goods, and the perfect is that which lacks nothing. Since then there is much pleasure in the act of the generative and nutritive powers it would seem that such acts belonging to animal life will be in the blessed, and much more in others, who will have less spiritual bodies.

On the contrary, It is written (Matt. 22. 30): "In the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married."

Further, Generation is directed to supply the defect resulting from death, and to the multiplication of the human race, and eating is directed to make up for waste, and to increase quantity. But in the state of the resurrection the human race will already have the number of individuals preordained by God, since generation will continue up to that point. In like manner each man will rise again in due quantity; neither will death be any more, nor any waste affect the parts of man. Therefore the acts of the generative and nutritive powers would be void of purpose.

I answer that, The resurrection will not be necessary to man on account of his primary perfection, which consists in the integrity of those things that belong to his nature, since man can attain to this in his present state of life by the action of natural causes; but the necessity of the resurrection regards the attainment of his ultimate perfection, which consists in his reaching his ultimate end. Consequently those natural operations which are directed to cause or preserve the primary perfection of human nature will not be in the resurrection; such are the actions of the animal life in man, the action of the elements on one another, and the movement of the heavens; therefore all these will cease at the resurrection. And since to eat, drink, sleep, beget, pertain to the animal life, being directed to the primary perfection of nature, it follows that they will not be in the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 1. When Christ partook of that meal, His eating was an act, not of necessity as though human nature needed food after the resurrection, but of power, so as to prove that He had resumed the true human nature which He had in that state wherein He ate and drank with His disciples. There will be no need of such proof at the general resurrection, since it will be evident to all. Hence Christ is said to have eaten by dispensation in the sense in which lawyers say that “a dispensation is a relaxation of the general law”[^13] because Christ made an exception to that which is common to those who rise again (namely not to partake of food) for the aforesaid motive. Hence the argument does not prove.

Reply Obj. 2. The distinction of sexes and the difference of members will be for the restoration of the perfection of human nature both in the species and in the individual. Hence it does not follow that they are without purpose, although they lack their animal operations.

Reply Obj. 3. These operations do not belong to man as man, as also the Philosopher states,[^14] and so the happiness of the human body does not consist in them. But the human body will be glorified by an overflow from the reason whereby man is man, in so far as the body will be subject to reason.

Reply Obj. 4. As the Philosopher says[^15] the pleasures of the body are medicinal, because they are applied to man for the removal of weariness; or again, they are unhealthy, in so far as man indulges in those pleasures inordinately, as though they were real pleasures, just as a man whose taste is vitiated delights in things which are not delightful to the healthy. Consequently it does not follow that such pleasures as these belong to the perfection of happiness, as the Jews[^16] and Turks[^17] maintain, and certain heretics known as the Chiliasts asserted;[^18] who, moreover, according to the Philosopher’s teaching,[^19] would seem to have an unhealthy appetite, since according to him none but spiritual pleasures are pleasures absolutely, and to be sought for their own sake. Therefore these alone are requisite for Happiness.

Whether at the resurrection the saints will rise again impassible in body? (2) Whether all will be equally impassible? (3) Whether this impassibility renders the glorious bodies insensible? (4) Whether in them all the senses are in act?

## Article 1. Whether the Bodies of the Saints Will Be Impassible After the Resurrection?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It seems that the bodies of the saints will not be impassible after the resurrection.

### Objection 1.
For everything mortal is passible. But man, after the resurrection, will be a mortal rational animal, for such is the definition of man, which will never be dissociated from him. Therefore the body will be passible.

### Objection 2.
Further, whatever is in potency to the form of another thing is passible in relation to something else; for this is what is meant by being passive to another thing.1 Now the bodies of the saints will be in potency to the form of another thing after the resurrection, since matter, according as it is under one form, does not lose its potency to another form. But the bodies of the saints after the resurrection will have matter in common with the elements, because they will be restored out of the same matter of which they are now composed. Therefore they will be in potency to another form, and thus will be passible.

### Objection 3.
Further, according to the Philosopher,2 contraries have a natural inclination to be active and passive towards one another. Now the bodies of the saints will be composed of contraries after the resurrection, even as now. Therefore they will be passible.

### Objection 4.
Further, in the human body the blood and humors will rise again, as stated above (Q. 80, A. 3). Now, sickness and such passions arise in the body through the antipathy of the humors. Therefore the bodies of the saints will be passible after the resurrection.

### Objection 5.
Further, actual defect is more inconsistent with perfection than potential defect. But passibility denotes merely potential defect. Since then there will be certain actual defects in the bodies of the blessed, such as the scars of the wounds in the martyrs, even as they were in Christ, it would seem that their perfections will not suffer, if we grant their bodies to be passible.

On the contrary, everything passible is corruptible, because increase of passion results in loss of substance. Now the bodies of the saints will be incorruptible after the resurrection, according to 1 Corinthians 15:42, "It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption." Therefore they will be impassible.

Further, the stronger is not passive to the weaker. But no body will be stronger than the bodies of the saints, of which it is written (1 Corinthians 15:43): "It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power." Therefore they will be impassible.

I answer that, we speak of a thing being passive in two ways. First, in a broad sense, and thus every reception is called a passion, whether the thing received be fitting to the receiver and perfect it, or contrary to it and corrupt it. The glorious bodies are not said to be impassible by the removal of this kind of passion, since nothing pertaining to perfection is to be removed from them. In another way we use the word passive properly, and thus Damascene defines passion (*De Fide Orthodoxa*, II, 22)3 as being "a movement contrary to nature." Hence an immoderate movement of the heart is called its passion, but a moderate movement is called its operation. The reason of this is that whatever is patient is drawn to the bounds of the agent, since the agent assimilates the patient to itself, so that, therefore, the patient as such is drawn beyond its own bounds within which it was confined. Accordingly, taking passion in its proper sense, there will be no potentiality to passion in the bodies of the saints after resurrection. Therefore they are said to be impassible.

The reason, however, of this impassibility is assigned differently by different persons. Some ascribe it to the condition of the elements, which will be different then from what it is now. For they say that the elements will remain then, as to substance, yet that they will be deprived of their active and passive qualities. But this does not seem to be true, because the active and passive qualities belong to the perfection of the elements, so that if the elements were restored without them in the body of the man that rises again, they would be less perfect than now. Moreover, since these qualities are the proper accidents of the elements, being caused by their form and matter, it would seem most absurd for the cause to remain and the effect to be removed.

Therefore others say that the qualities will remain, but deprived of their proper activities, the Divine power so doing for the preservation of the human body. This, however, would seem to be untenable, since the action and passion of the active and passive qualities is necessary for the mixture (of the elements), and according as one or the other preponderates the mixed (bodies) differ in their respective temperaments, and this must apply to the bodies of those who rise again, for they will contain flesh and bones and like parts, all of which demand different temperaments. Moreover, according to this, impassibility could not be one of their gifts, because it would not imply a disposition in the impassible substance, but merely an external preventive to passion, namely the power of God, which might produce the same effect in a human body even in this state of life.

Consequently, others say that in the body itself there will be something preventing the passion of a glorified body, namely the nature of a fifth1 or heavenly body, which they maintain enters into the composition of a human body, to the effect of blending the elements together in harmony so as to be fitting matter for the rational soul; but that in this state of life, on account of the preponderance of the elemental nature, the human body is passible like other elements, whereas in the resurrection the nature of the fifth body will predominate, so that the human body will be made impassible in likeness to the heavenly body. But this cannot stand, because the fifth body does not enter materially into the composition of a human body, as was proved above.2 Moreover, it is absurd to say that a natural power, such as the power of a heavenly body, should endow the human body with a property of glory, such as the impassibility of a glorified body, since the Apostle ascribes to Christ’s power the transformation of the human body, because "such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly" (1 Corinthians 15:48), and "He will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His glory, according to the operation whereby also He is able to subdue all things unto Himself" (Philippians 3:21). And again, a heavenly nature cannot exercise such power over the human body as to take from it its elemental nature which is passible by reason of its essential constituents.

Consequently, we must say otherwise that all passion results from the agent overcoming the patient, for otherwise it would not draw it to its own bounds. Now it is impossible for agent to overcome patient except through the weakening of the hold which the form of the patient has over its matter, if we speak of the passion which is against nature, for it is of passion in this sense that we are speaking now; for matter is not subject to one of two contraries, except through the cessation or at least the lessening of the hold which the other contrary has on it. Now the human body and all that it contains will be perfectly subject to the rational soul, even as the soul will be perfectly subject to God. Therefore it will be impossible for the glorified body to be subject to any change contrary to the disposition whereby it is perfected by the soul. And consequently, those bodies will be impassible.

### Reply Obj. 1.
According to Anselm (*Cur Deus Homo*, II, 11),3 "mortal is included in the philosophers’ definition of man, because they did not believe that the whole man could be ever immortal," for they had no experience of man otherwise than in this state of mortality. Or we may say that since, according to the Philosopher,4 essential differences are unknown to us, we sometimes employ accidental differences in order to signify essential differences from which the accidental differences result. Hence "mortal" is put in the definition of man, not as though mortality were essential to man, but because that which causes passibility and mortality in the present state of life, namely composition of contraries, is essential to man, but it will not cause it then, on account of the triumph of the soul over the body.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Potency is twofold, tied (*ligata*) and free; and this is true not only of active but also of passive potency. For the form ties the potency of matter, by determining it to one thing, and it is thus that it overcomes it. And since in corruptible things form does not perfectly overcome matter, it cannot tie it completely so as to prevent it from sometimes receiving a disposition contrary to the form through some passion. But in the saints after the resurrection, the soul will have complete dominion over the body, and it will be altogether impossible for it to lose this dominion, because it will be immutably subject to God, which was not the case in the state of innocence. Consequently, those bodies will retain substantially the same potency as they have now to another form; yet that potentiality will remain tied by the triumph of the soul over the body, so that it will never be realized by actual passion.

### Reply Obj. 3.
The elemental qualities are the instruments of the soul, as stated in the book on the *Soul*,1 for the heat of fire in an animal's body is directed in the act of nutrition by the soul’s power. When, however, the principal agent is perfect, and there is no defect in the instrument, no action proceeds from the instrument except in accordance with the disposition of the principal agent. Consequently, in the bodies of the saints after the resurrection, no action or passion will result from the elemental qualities that is contrary to the disposition of the soul which has the preservation of the body in view.

### Reply Obj. 4.
According to Augustine (*Ep. ad Consentium*, CCV, 1)2 "the Divine power is able to remove whatever qualities He will from this visible and tangible body, other qualities remaining." Hence even as in a certain respect He deprived the flames of the Chaldees’ furnace of the power to burn, since the bodies of the children were preserved without hurt, while in another respect that power remained, since those flames consumed the wood, so will He remove passibility from the humors while leaving their nature unchanged. It has been explained in the Article how this is brought about.

### Reply Obj. 5.
The scars of wounds will not be in the saints, nor were they in Christ, in so far as they imply a defect, but as signs of the most steadfast virtue whereby the saints suffered for the sake of justice and faith, so that this will increase their own and others’ joy.3 Hence Augustine says:4
> "We feel an undescribable love for the blessed martyrs so as to desire to see in that kingdom the scars of the wounds in their bodies, which they bore for Christ’s name. Perhaps indeed we shall see them, for this will not make them less comely but more glorious. A certain beauty will shine in them, a beauty though in the body, yet not of the body but of virtue."
Nevertheless, those martyrs who have been maimed and deprived of their limbs will not be without those limbs in the resurrection of the dead, for to them it is said (Luke 21:18): "A hair of your head shall not perish."

## Article 2. Whether All Will Be Equally Impassible?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that all will be equally impassible.

### Objection 1.
For a gloss on 1 Corinthians 15:42, "It is sown in corruption," says that all have equal immunity from suffering.5 Now the gift of impassibility consists in immunity from suffering. Therefore all will be equally impassible.

### Objection 2.
Further, negations are not subject to be more or less. Now impassibility is a negation or privation of passibility. Therefore it cannot be greater in one subject than in another.

### Objection 3.
Further, a thing is more white if it have less admixture of black. But there will be no admixture of passibility in any of the saints’ bodies. Therefore they will all be equally impassible.

On the contrary, reward should be proportionate to merit. Now some of the saints were greater in merit than others. Therefore, since impassibility is a reward, it would seem to be greater in some than in others.

Further, impassibility is divided against the gift of clarity. Now the latter will not be equal in all, according to 1 Corinthians 15:41. Therefore neither will impassibility be equal in all.

I answer that, impassibility may be considered in two ways, either in itself, or in respect of its cause. If it be considered in itself, since it denotes a mere negation or privation, it is not subject to be more or less, but will be equal in all the blessed. On the other hand, if we consider it in relation to its cause, thus it will be greater in one person than in another. Now its cause is the dominion of the soul over the body, and this dominion is caused by the soul’s unchangeable enjoyment of God. Consequently, in one who enjoys God more perfectly, there is a greater cause of impassibility.

### Reply Obj. 1.
This gloss is speaking of impassibility in itself and not in relation to its cause.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Although negations and privations considered in themselves are not increased nor diminished, yet they are subject to increase and lessening in relation to their causes. Thus a place is said to be more darksome from having more and greater obstacles to light.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Some things increase not only by receding from their contrary, but also by approach to a term; in this way light increases. Consequently, impassibility also is greater in one subject than in another, although there is no passibility remaining in any one.

## Article 3. Whether Impassibility Excludes Actual Sensation from Glorified Bodies?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that impassibility excludes actual sensation from glorified bodies.

### Objection 1.
For according to the Philosopher,1 "sensation is a kind of passion." But the glorified bodies will be impassible. Therefore they will not have actual sensation.

### Objection 2.
Further, natural change precedes spiritual2 change, just as natural being precedes intentional being. Now glorified bodies, by reason of their impassibility, will not be subject to natural change. Therefore they will not be subject to spiritual change which is requisite for sensation.

### Objection 3.
Further, whenever the sense is put in act, with the new reception there is a new judgment. But in that state there will be no new judgment, because "our thoughts will not then be changeable," as Augustine says (*De Trinitate*, XV, 16).3 Therefore there will be no actual sensation.

### Objection 4.
Further, when one of the soul’s powers is in act, the acts of the other powers are less intense. Now the soul will be supremely intent on the act of the contemplative power in contemplating God. Therefore the soul will have no actual sensation whatever.

On the contrary, it is written (Apocalypse 1:7): "Every eye shall see Him." Therefore there will be actual sensation.

Further, according to the Philosopher,4 "the animate is distinct from the inanimate by sensation and movement." Now there will be actual movement since "they shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds" (Wisdom 3:7). Therefore there will also be actual sensation.

I answer that, all are agreed that there is some sensation in the bodies of the blessed; otherwise the bodily life of the saints after the resurrection would be likened to sleep rather than to watchfulness. Now this is not befitting that perfection, because in sleep a sensible body is not in the ultimate act of life, for which reason sleep is described in the *Ethics* as half-life.5 But there is a difference of opinion as to the mode of sensation.

For some say that the glorified bodies will be impassible, and consequently not susceptible to strange impressions, and much less so than the heavenly bodies, because they will have actual sensations, not by receiving species from sensibles, but by emission of species. But this is impossible, since in the resurrection, the specific nature will remain the same in man and in all his parts. Now the nature of sense is to be a passive power, as the Philosopher proves.6 Therefore, if the saints, in the resurrection, were to have sensations by emitting and not by receiving species, sense in them would not be a passive but an active power, and thus it would not be the same specifically with sense as it is now, but would be some other power bestowed on them; for just as matter never becomes form, so a passive power never becomes active.

Consequently, others say that the senses will be actualized by receiving species, not indeed from external sensibles, but by an outflow from the higher powers, so that as now the higher powers receive from the lower, so on the contrary the lower powers will then receive from the higher. But this mode of reception does not result in real sensation, because every passive power, according to its specific character, is determined to some special active principle, since a power as such bears relation to that with respect to which it is said to be the power. Therefore, since the proper active principle in external sensation is a thing existing outside the soul and not an intention thereof existing in the imagination or reason, if the organ of sense be not moved by external things but by the imagination or other higher powers, there will be no true sensation. Hence we do not say that madmen or other witless persons (in whom there is this kind of outflow of species towards the organs of sense, on account of the powerful influence of the imagination) have real sensations, but that it seems to them that they have sensations.

Consequently, we must say with others that sensation in glorified bodies will result from the reception of things outside the soul. It must, however, be observed that the organs of sense are changed by things outside the soul in two ways. First, by a natural change, when namely the organ is disposed by the same natural quality as the thing outside the soul which acts on that organ; for instance, when the hand is heated by touching a hot object, or becomes fragrant through contact with a fragrant object. Secondly, by a spiritual change, as when a sensible quality is received in an instrument according to a spiritual mode of being, when, namely, the species or the intention of a quality, and not the quality itself is received; thus the pupil receives the species of whiteness and yet does not itself become white. Accordingly, the first reception does not cause sensation, properly speaking, because the senses are receptive of species in matter but without matter; that is to say, without the material being which the species had outside the soul.1 This reception changes the nature of the recipient, because in this way the quality is received according to its material being. Consequently, this kind of reception will not be in the glorified bodies, but the second, which of itself causes actual sensation, without changing the nature of the recipient.

### Reply Obj. 1.
As already explained, by this passion that takes place in actual sensation and is no other than the aforesaid reception of species, the body is not drawn away from natural quality, but is perfected spiritually. And so the impassibility of glorified bodies does not exclude this kind of passion.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Every subject of passion receives the action of the agent according to its mode. Accordingly, if there be a thing that is naturally adapted to be changed by an active principle, with a natural and a spiritual change, the natural change precedes the spiritual change, just as natural precedes intentional being. If, however, a thing be naturally adapted to be changed only with a spiritual change, it does not follow that it is changed naturally. For instance, the air is not receptive of color, according to its natural being, but only according to its spiritual being, and therefore in this way alone is it changed; but, on the contrary, inanimate bodies are changed by sensible qualities only naturally and not spiritually. But in the glorified bodies there cannot be any natural change, and consequently, there will be only spiritual change.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Just as there will be new reception of species in the organs of sensation, so there will be new judgment in the common sense, but there will be no new judgment on the point in the intellect; such is the case with one who sees what he knew before. The saying of Augustine, that "there our thoughts will not be changeable," refers to the thoughts of the intellectual part; therefore it is not to the point.

### Reply Obj. 4.
When one of two things is the type of the other, the attention of the soul to the one does not hinder or lessen its attention to the other; thus a physician while considering urine is not less but more able to bear in mind the rules of his art concerning the colors of urine. And since God is apprehended by the saints as the type of all things that will be done or known by them, their attention to perceiving sensibles, or to contemplating or doing anything else will in no way hinder their contemplation of God, nor conversely. Or we may say that the reason why one power is hindered in its act when another power is intensely engaged is because one power does not alone suffice for such an intense operation unless it is assisted by receiving from the principle of life the inflow that the other powers or members should receive. And since in the saints all the powers will be most perfect, one will be able to operate intensely without thereby hindering the operation of another power, even as it was with Christ.

## Article 4. Whether in the Blessed, After the Resurrection, All the Senses Will Be in Act?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that all the senses are not in act there.

### Objection 1.
For touch is the first of all the senses.2 But the glorified body will lack the actual sense of touch, since the sense of touch becomes actual by the changing of an animal body by some external body preponderating in some one of the active or passive qualities which touch is capable of discerning, and such a change will then be impossible. Therefore all the senses will not be in act there.

### Objection 2.
Further, the sense of taste assists the action of the nutritive power. Now after the resurrection there will be no such action, as stated above (Q. 81, A. 4). Therefore taste would be useless there.

### Objection 3.
Further, nothing will be corrupted after the resurrection because the whole creature will be invested with a certain virtue of incorruption. Now the sense of smell cannot have its act without some corruption having taken place, because smell is not perceived without a volatile evaporation consisting in a certain dissolution. Therefore the sense of smell is not there in its act.

### Objection 4.
Further, "Hearing assists teaching."1 But the blessed, after the resurrection, will require no teaching by means of sensible things, since they will be filled with Divine wisdom by the very vision of God. Therefore hearing will not be there.

### Objection 5.
Further, seeing results from the pupil receiving the species of the thing seen. But after the resurrection this will be impossible in the blessed. Therefore there will be no actual seeing there, and yet this is the most noble of the senses. The minor is proved thus: That which is actually lightsome is not receptive of a visible species; and consequently a mirror placed under the sun’s rays does not reflect the image of a body opposite to it. Now the pupil like the whole body will be endowed with clarity. Therefore it will not receive the image of a colored body.

### Objection 6.
Further, according to the science of perspective, whatever is seen is seen at an angle. But this does not apply to the glorified bodies. Therefore they will not have actual sense of sight. The minor is proved thus: Whenever a thing is seen at an angle, the angle must be proportionate to the distance of the thing seen, because what is seen from a greater distance is less seen and at a lesser angle, so that the angle may be so small that nothing is seen of the object. Therefore, if the glorified eye sees at an angle, it follows that it sees things within a certain distance, and that consequently it does not see a thing from a greater distance than we see now, and this would seem very absurd. And thus it would seem that the sense of sight will not be actual in glorified bodies.

On the contrary, a power joined to its act is more perfect than one not so joined. Now human nature in the blessed will be in its greatest perfection. Therefore all the senses will be actual there.

Further, the sensitive powers are nearer to the soul than the body is. But the body will be rewarded or punished on account of the merits or demerits of the soul. Therefore all the senses in the blessed will also be rewarded, and in the wicked will be punished, with regard to pleasure and pain or sorrow which consist in the operation of the senses.

I answer that, there are two opinions on this question. For some say that in the glorified bodies there will be all the sensitive powers, but that only two senses will be in act, namely touch and sight. Nor will this be owing to defective senses, but from lack of medium and object. Nor will the senses be useless, because they will conduce to the integrity of human

nature and will show forth the wisdom of their Creator. But this it seems is untrue, because the medium in these senses is the same as in the others. For in sight the medium is the air, and this is also the medium in hearing and smelling.^1^ Again, the taste, like the touch, has the medium in contact, since taste is a kind of touch.^2^ Smell also, which is the object of the sense of smell, will be there, since the Church sings that the bodies of the saints will be a most sweet smell. There will also be vocal praise in heaven; hence Augustine says on Psalm 149:6,
> The high praises of God shall be in their mouth,
that hearts and tongues shall not cease to praise God.^3^ The same is had on the authority of a gloss^4^ on 2 Esdras 12:27,
> With singing and with cymbals.
Therefore, according to others we must say that smelling and hearing will be in act there, but taste will not be in act, in the sense of being changed by the taking of food or drink, as appears from what we have said (Q. LXXXI, A. 4) unless perhaps we say that there will be taste in act through the tongue being changed by some neighboring humor.

Reply Obj. 1. The qualities perceived by the touch are those which constitute the animal body. Therefore the body of an animal has, through its tangible qualities according to the present state of life, a natural aptitude to be changed with a natural and spiritual alteration by the object of touch. For this reason the touch is said to be the most material of the senses, since it has a greater measure of material change connected with it. Yet material change is only accidentally related to the act of sensation which is effected by a spiritual change. Consequently the glorified bodies, which by reason of their impassibility are immune from natural change, will be subject only to spiritual change by tangible qualities. Thus it was with the body of Adam, which could neither be burnt by fire, nor pierced by sword, although he had the sense of such things.

Reply Obj. 2. Taste, in so far as it is the perception of food, will not be in act; but perhaps it will be possible in so far as it is a judge of flavors in the way mentioned above (Reply 1).

Reply Obj. 3. Some have considered smell to be merely a volatile evaporation. But this opinion cannot be true; which is evident from the fact that vultures hasten to a corpse on perceiving the odor from a very great distance, although it would be impossible for an evaporation to travel from the corpse to a place so remote, even though the whole corpse were to be dissolved into vapor. This is confirmed by the fact that sensible objects at an equal distance exercise their influence in all directions, so that smell changes the medium sometimes, and the instrument of sensation with a spiritual change, without any evaporation reaching the organ. That some evaporation should be necessary is due to the fact that smell in bodies is mixed with humidity; therefore it is necessary for dissolution to take place in order for the smell to be perceived. But in the glorified bodies odor will be in its ultimate perfection, being in no way hampered by humidity; therefore it will affect the organ with a spiritual change, like the odor of a volatile evaporation. Such will be the sense of smell in the saints, because it will not be hindered by any humidity, and it will know not only of the excellence of odors, as happens with us now on account of the very great humidity of the brain, but also of the minutest differences of odors.

Reply Obj. 4. In heaven there will be vocal praise (though indeed some think otherwise), and in the blessed it will affect the organ of hearing by a merely spiritual change. Nor will it be for the sake of learning whereby they may acquire knowledge, but for the sake of the perfection of the sense and for the sake of pleasure. How it is possible for the voice to give sound there, we have already stated.^5^

Reply Obj. 5. The intensity of light does not hinder the spiritual reception of the image of color, so long as the pupil retains its diaphanous nature; thus it is evident that however much the air be filled with light, it can be the medium of sight, and the more it is illumined, the more clearly are objects seen through it, unless there be a fault through defective sight. The fact that the image of an object placed in opposition to a mirror directly opposite the sun’s rays does not appear therein, is not due to the reception being hindered, but to the hindering of reflection, because for an image to appear in a mirror it must be thrown back by an opaque body, for which reason lead is affixed to the glass in a mirror. The sun’s ray dispels this opacity so that no image can appear in the mirror. But the clarity of a glorified body does not destroy the diaphanous nature of the pupil, since glory does not destroy nature; and consequently the greatness of clarity in the pupil renders the sight keen rather than defective.

Reply Obj. 6. The more perfect the sense the less does it require to be changed in order to perceive its object. Now the smaller the angle at which the sight is affected by the visible object, the less is the organ altered. Hence it is that a stronger sight can see from a distance more than a weaker sight, because the greater the distance the smaller the angle at which a thing is seen. And since the sight of a glorified body will be most perfect it will be able to see by the very least alteration (of the organ), and consequently at a very much smaller angle than now, and therefore from a much greater distance.

# QUESTION LXXXIII
## Of the Subtlety of the Bodies of the Blessed

(In Six Articles)

We must now consider the subtlety of the bodies of the blessed. Under this head there are six points of inquiry:
1.  Whether subtlety is a property of the glorified body?
2.  Whether by reason of this subtlety it can be in the same place with another not glorified body?
3.  Whether by a miracle two bodies can be in the same place?
4.  Whether a glorified body can be in the same place with another glorified body?
5.  Whether a glorified body necessarily requires a place equal to itself?
6.  Whether a glorified body is palpable?

### Article 1. Whether Subtlety Is a Property of the Glorified Body?

We proceed thus to the First Article. It would seem that subtlety is not a property of the glorified body.

Objection 1. For the properties of glory surpass the properties of nature, even as the clarity of glory surpasses the clarity of the sun, which is the greatest in nature. Accordingly if subtlety be a property of the glorified body, it would seem that the glorified body will be more subtle than anything which is subtle in nature, and thus it will be more subtle than the wind and the air, which was condemned by Gregory in the city of Constantinople, as he relates (*Moralia*, XIV, 56).^6^

Obj. 2. Further, As heat and cold are simple qualities of bodies, that is, of the elements, so is subtlety. But heat and other qualities of the elements will not be intensified in the glorified bodies any more than they are now; in fact they will be more reduced to the mean. Neither, therefore, will subtlety be in them more than it is now.

Obj. 3. Further, Subtlety is in bodies as a result of scarcity of matter, and therefore bodies that have less matter within equal dimensions are said to be more subtle; as fire in comparison with air, and air as compared with water, and water as compared with earth. But there will be as much matter in the glorified bodies as there is now, nor will their dimensions be greater, as appears from what we said above (Q. LXXX, AA. 4, 5; Q. LXXXI, A. 2). Therefore they will not be more subtle then than now.

On the contrary. It is written (1 Corinthians 15:44):
> It is sown a corruptible body, it shall rise a spiritual, that is, a spirit-like, body.
But the subtlety of a spirit surpasses all bodily subtlety. Therefore the glorified bodies will be most subtle.
Further, The more subtle a body is the more exalted it is. But the glorified bodies will be most exalted. Therefore they will be most subtle.

I answer that. Subtlety takes its name from the power to penetrate. Hence it is said^7^ that a subtle thing “fills all the parts and the parts of parts.” Now that a body has the power of penetrating may happen through two causes. First, through smallness of quantity, especially in respect of depth and breadth, but not of length, because penetration regards depth, and therefore length is not an obstacle to penetration. Secondly, through paucity of matter, and so rarity is synonymous with subtlety, and since in rare bodies the form is more predominant over the matter, the term subtlety has been transferred to those bodies which are most perfectly subject to their form, and are most fully perfected by them; thus we speak of subtlety in the sun and moon and like bodies, just as gold and similar things may be called subtle, when they are most perfectly complete in their specific being and power. And since incorporeal things lack quantity and matter, the term subtlety is applied to them, not only by reason of their substance, but also on account of their power. For just as a subtle thing is said to be penetrative, for the reason that it reaches to the inmost part of a thing, so is an intellect said to be subtle because it reaches to the insight of the intrinsic principles and the hidden natural properties of a thing. In like manner a person is said to have subtle sight, because he is able to perceive by sight things of the smallest size; and the same applies to the other senses. Accordingly people have differed by ascribing subtlety to the glorified bodies in different ways.

For certain heretics, as Augustine relates,^8^ ascribed to them the subtlety whereby spiritual substances are said to be subtle, and they said that at the resurrection the body will be transformed into a spirit, and that for this reason the Apostle describes as being spiritual the bodies of those who rise again (1 Corinthians 15:44). But this cannot be maintained. First, because a body cannot be changed into a spirit, since there is no community of matter between them, and Boethius proves this (*De duab. Nat.* VI).^9^ Secondly, because, if this were possible, and one’s body were changed into a spirit, one would not rise again a man, for a man naturally consists of a soul and body. Thirdly, because if this were the Apostle’s meaning, just as he speaks of spiritual bodies, so would he speak of natural (animate) bodies, as being changed into souls (*animam*): and this is clearly false.

Hence certain heretics said that the body will remain at the resurrection, but that it will be endowed with subtlety by means of rarefaction, so that human bodies in rising again will be like the air or the wind, as Gregory relates (*Moralia*, XIV, 56).^10^ But this again cannot be maintained, because our Lord had a palpable body after the Resurrection, as appears from the last chapter of Luke, and we must believe that His body was supremely subtle. Moreover the human body will rise again with flesh and bones, as did the body of our Lord, according to Luke 24:39,
> A spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see Me to have,
and Job 19:26,
> In my flesh I shall see God, my Saviour,
and the nature of flesh and bone is incompatible with the aforesaid rarity.

Consequently another kind of subtlety must be assigned to glorified bodies, by saying that they are subtle on account of the most complete perfection of the body. But this completeness is explained by some in relation to the fifth, or heavenly, essence, which will be then predominant in them. This, however, is impossible, since first of all the fifth essence can in no way enter into the composition of a body, as we have shown above.^11^ Secondly, because granted that it entered into the composition of the human body, it would be impossible to account for its having a greater predominance over the elemental nature then than now, unless either the amount of the heavenly nature in human bodies were increased (thus human bodies would not be of the same stature, unless perhaps elemental matter in man were decreased, which is inconsistent with the integrity of those who rise again), or unless elemental nature were endowed with the properties of the heavenly nature through the latter’s dominion over the body, and in that case a natural power would be the cause of a property of glory, which seems absurd.

Hence others say that the aforesaid completeness by reason of which human bodies are said to be subtle will result from the dominion of the glorified soul (which is the form of the body) over the body, by reason of which dominion the glorified body is said to be spiritual, as being wholly subject to the spirit. The first subjection whereby the body is subject to the soul is to the effect of its participating in its specific being, in so far as it is subject to the soul as matter to form; and secondly it is subject to the soul in respect of the other operations of the soul, in so far as the soul is a principle of movement. Consequently the first reason for spirituality in the body is subtlety, and, after that, agility and the other properties of a glorified body. Hence the Apostle, as the masters expound,^12^ in speaking of spirituality indicates subtlety. Hence Gregory says (*Moralia*, XIV, 56)^13^ that the glorified body “is said to be subtle as a result of a spiritual power.”

This suffices for the Replies to the Objections which refer to the subtlety of rarefaction.

### Article 2. Whether By Reason of This Subtlety a Glorified Body Is Able To Be in the Same Place With Another Body Not Glorified?

We proceed thus to the Second Article. It would seem that by reason of this subtlety a body is able to be in the same place with another body not glorified.

Objection 1. For according to Philippians 3:21,
> He will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His glory.
Now the body of Christ was able to be in the same place with another body, as appears from the fact that after His Resurrection He went in to His disciples, the doors being shut (John 20:19, 26). Therefore also the glorified bodies by reason of their subtlety will be able to be in the same place with other bodies not glorified.

Obj. 2. Further, Glorified bodies will be superior to all other bodies. Yet by reason of their superiority certain bodies, namely the solar rays, are able now to occupy the same place together with other bodies. Much more therefore is this befitting glorified bodies.

Obj. 3. Further, A heavenly body cannot be severed, at least as regards the substance of the spheres; hence it is written (Job 37:18) that
> the heavens ... are most strong, as if they were of molten brass.
If then the subtlety of a glorified body will not enable it to be in the same place together with another body, it will never be able to ascend to the empyrean,^14^ and this is erroneous.

Obj. 4. Further, A body which is unable to be in the same place with another body can be hindered in its movement or even surrounded by others standing in its way. But this cannot happen to glorified bodies. Therefore they will be able to be together in the same place with other bodies.

Obj. 5. Further, As point is to point, so is line to line, surface to surface, and body to body. Now two points can be coincident, as in the case of two lines touching one another, and two lines when two surfaces are in contact with one another, and two surfaces when two bodies touch one another, because contiguous things are “those whose boundaries coincide.”^15^ Therefore it is not against the nature of a body to be in the same place together with another body. Now whatever excellence is possible to the nature of a body will all be bestowed on the glorified body. Therefore a glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, will be able to be in the same place together with another body.

On the contrary. Boethius says (*De Trinitate* I):^16^
> Difference of accidents makes distinction in number. For three men differ not in genus, nor in species, but in their accidents. If we were to remove absolutely every accident from them, still each one has a different place; and it is quite inconceivable that they should all occupy the same place.
Therefore if we suppose two bodies to occupy the same place, there will be but one body numerically.
Further, Glorified bodies have more congruity with place than do angelic spirits. But angelic spirits, according to some, could not be distinguished numerically unless they were in different places; for the same reason they held that they must be in a place, and that they could not have been created before the world. Much more therefore must they say that no two bodies can be in the same place.

I answer that. It cannot be maintained that a glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, is able to be in the same place with another body, unless the obstacle to its being now in the same place with another body be removed by that subtlety. Some say that in the present state this obstacle is its grossness by virtue of which it is able to occupy a place, and that this grossness is removed by the gift of subtlety. But there are two reasons why this cannot be maintained. First because the grossness which the gift of subtlety removes is a kind of defect, for instance a lack of order of matter in not being perfectly subject to its form. For all that pertains to the integrity of the body will rise again in the body, both as regards the matter and as regards the form. And the fact that a body is able to fill a place belongs to it by reason of that which pertains to its integrity, and not on account of any defect of nature. For since fullness is opposed to vacancy, that alone does not fill a place, which being put in a place, nevertheless leaves a place vacant. Now a vacuum is defined by the Philosopher^17^ as being “a place not filled by a sensible body.” And a body is said to be sensible by reason of its matter, form, and natural accidents, all of which pertain to the integrity of nature. It is also plain that the glorified body will be sensible even to touch, as evidenced by the body of our Lord (Luke 24:39), nor will it lack matter, or form, or natural accidents, namely heat, cold, and so forth. Hence it is evident that the glorified body, the gift of subtlety notwithstanding, will fill a place, for it would seem madness to say that the place in which there will be a glorified body will be empty. Secondly their argument does not avail because to hinder the co-existence of a body in the same place is more than to fill a place. For if we suppose dimensions separate from matter, those dimensions do not fill a place. Hence some who held the possibility of a vacuum said that a vacuum is a place in which such dimensions exist apart from a sensible body, and yet those dimensions hinder another body from being together with them in the same place. This is made clear by the Philosopher,^18^ where he considers it impossible for a mathematical body, which is nothing but separate dimensions, to be together with another natural sensible body. Consequently, granted that the subtlety of a glorified body hindered it from filling a place, nevertheless it would not follow that for this reason it is able to be in the same place with another body, since the removal of the lesser does not involve the removal of the greater.

Accordingly it seems that the obstacle to our body’s being now in the same place with another body can in no way be removed by the gift of subtlety. For nothing can prevent a body from occupying the same place together with another body, except something in it that requires a different place, since nothing is an obstacle to identity save that which is a cause of distinction. Now this distinction of place is not required by any quality of the body, because a body does not demand a place by reason of its quality; and so if we remove from a body the fact of its being hot or cold, heavy or light, it still retains the necessity of the aforesaid distinction, as the Philosopher makes clear,^19^ and as is self-evident. In like manner neither can matter cause the necessity of this distinction, because matter does not occupy a place except through its dimensive quantity. Again neither does form occupy a place, unless it have a place through its matter.

It remains therefore that the necessity for two bodies occupying each a distinct place results from the nature of dimensive quantity, to which a place is essentially befitting. For this forms part of its definition, since dimensive quantity is quantity occupying a place. Hence it is that if we remove all else in a thing from it, the necessity of this distinction is found in its dimensive quantity alone. Thus take the example of a separate line, supposing there to be two such lines, or two parts of one line, they must occupy distinct places, for otherwise one line added to another would not make something greater, and this is against common sense (*communes conceptiones*). The same applies to surfaces and mathematical bodies. And since matter demands place, through being the subject of dimension, the above necessity results in placed matter, so that just as it is impossible for there to be two lines, or two parts of a line, unless they occupy distinct places, so is it impossible for there to be two matters, or two parts of matter, without there be distinction of place. And since distinction of matter is the principle of the distinction between individuals, it follows that, as Boethius says (*De Trinitate* I),^20^ “we cannot possibly conceive two bodies occupying one place,” so that this distinction of individuals requires this difference of accidents. Now subtlety does not deprive the glorified body of its dimension; therefore it in no way removes from it the above necessity of occupying a distinct place from another body. Therefore the subtlety of a glorified body will not enable it to be in the same place together with another body, but it will be possible for it to be together with another body by the operation of the Divine power, even as the body of Peter had the power whereby the sick were healed at the passing of Peter’s shadow (Acts 5:15) not through any inherent property, but by the power of God for the upbuilding of the faith. Thus will the Divine power make it possible for a glorified body to be in the same place together with another body for the perfection of glory.

Reply Obj. 1. That Christ’s body was able to be together with another body in the same place was not due to its subtlety, but resulted from the power of His Godhead after His resurrection, even as in His birth. Hence Gregory says (*Homiliae in Evangelia*, XXVI):^21^
> The same body went into His disciples the doors being shut, which to human eyes came from the closed womb of the Virgin at His birth.
Therefore there is no reason why this should be befitting to glorified bodies on account of their subtlety.

Reply Obj. 2. Light is not a body as we have said above (II *Sent.*, Q. XIII, A. 3; Part I, Q. LXVII, A. 2). Hence the objection proceeds on a false supposition.

Reply Obj. 3. The glorified body will pass through the heavenly spheres without severing them, not by virtue of its subtlety, but by the Divine power, which will assist them in all things at will.

Reply Obj. 4. From the fact that God will come to the aid of the blessed at will in whatever they desire, it follows that they cannot be surrounded or imprisoned.

Reply Obj. 5. As stated in the *Physics*,^22^ “place is not befitting a point”; hence if it be said to be in a place, this is only accidental, because the body of which it is a term is in a place. And just as the whole place corresponds to the whole body, so the term of the place corresponds to the term of the body. But it happens that two places have one term, even as two lines terminate in one point. And consequently though two bodies must be in distinct places, yet the same term of two places corresponds to the two terms of the two bodies. It is in this sense that the bounds of contiguous bodies are said to coincide.

### Article 3. Whether It Is Possible, By a Miracle, for Two Bodies To Be in the Same Place?

We proceed thus to the Third Article. It would seem that not even by a miracle is it possible for two bodies to be in the same place.

Objection 1. For it is not possible that, by a miracle, two bodies be at once two and one, since this would imply that contradictions are true at the same time. But if we suppose two bodies to be in the same place, it would follow that those two bodies are one. Therefore this cannot be done by a miracle. The minor is proved thus. Suppose two bodies A and B to be in the same place. The dimensions of A will either be the same as the dimensions of the place, or they will differ from them. If they differ, then some of the dimensions will be separate, which is impossible, since the dimensions that are within the bounds of a place are not in a subject unless they are in a placed body. If they are the same, then for the same reason the dimensions of B will be the same as the dimensions of the place. Now things that are the same with one and the same thing are the same with one another. Therefore the dimensions of A and B are the same. But two bodies cannot have identical dimensions just as they cannot have the same whiteness. Therefore A and B are one body and yet they were two. Therefore they are at the same time one and two.

Obj. 2. Further, A thing cannot be done miraculously either against the common principles, for instance, that the part is not less than the whole, since what is contrary to common principles implies a direct contradiction; or contrary to the conclusions of geometry which are infallible deductions from common principles—for instance that the three angles of a triangle should not be equal to two right angles. In like manner nothing can be done to a line that is contrary to the definition of a line, because to sever the definition from the defined

is to make two contradictories true at the same time. Now it is contrary both to the conclusions of geometry and to the definition of a line for two bodies to be in the same place. Therefore this cannot be done by a miracle.

The minor is proved as follows: It is a conclusion of geometry that two circles touch one another only at a point. Now if two circular bodies were in the same place, the two circles described in them would touch one another as a whole. Again it is contrary to the definition of a line that there be more than one straight line between two points, yet this would be the case were two bodies in the same place, since between two given points in the various surfaces of the place, there would be two straight lines corresponding to the two bodies in that place.

#### Obj. 3.
Further, It would seem impossible that by a miracle a body which is enclosed within another should not be in a place, for then it would have a common and not a proper place, and this is impossible. Yet this would follow if two bodies were in the same place. Therefore this cannot be done by a miracle.

The minor is proved thus. Supposing two bodies to be in the same place, the one being greater than the other as to every dimension, the lesser body will be enclosed in the greater, and the place occupied by the greater body will be its common place; while it will have no proper place, because no given surface of the body will contain it, and this is essential to place. Therefore it will not have a proper place.

#### Obj. 4.
Further, Place corresponds in proportion to the thing placed. Now it can never happen by a miracle that the same body is at the same time in different places, except by some kind of change, as in the Sacrament of the Altar. Therefore it can in no way happen by a miracle that two bodies be together in the same place.

#### On the contrary,
The Blessed Virgin gave birth to her Son by a miracle. Now in this hallowed birth it was necessary for two bodies to be together in the same place, because the body of her child when coming forth did not break through the enclosure of her virginal purity. Therefore it is possible for two bodies to be miraculously together in the same place.

#### Further,
This may again be proved from the fact that our Lord went in to His disciples, the doors being shut (John 20:19, 26).

#### I answer that,
As shown above (a. 2) the reason why two bodies must be in two places is that distinction in matter requires distinction in place. Therefore we observe that when two bodies merge into one, each loses its distinct being, and one indistinct being accrues to the two combined, as in the case of mixtures. Hence it is impossible for two bodies to remain two and yet be together unless each retain its distinct being which it had before, according as each of them was a being undivided in itself and distinct from others. Now this distinct being depends on the essential principles of a thing as on its proximate causes, but on God as on the first cause. And since the first cause can preserve a thing in being, though the second causes be done away, as appears from the first proposition of *De Causis*^1, therefore by God’s power and by that alone it is possible for an accident to be without substance as in the Sacrament of the Altar. Likewise by the power of God, and by that alone, it is possible for a body to retain its distinct being from that of another body, although its matter be not distinct as to place from the matter of the other body; and thus it is possible by a miracle for two bodies to be together in the same place.

#### Reply Obj. 1.
This argument is sophistical because it is based on a false supposition, or begs the question. For it supposes the existence, between two opposite surfaces of a place, of a dimension proper to the place, with which dimension a dimension of the body put in occupation of the place would have to be identified, because it would then follow that the dimensions of two bodies occupying a place would become one dimension, if each of them were identified with the dimension of the place. But this supposition is false, because if it were true whenever a body acquires a new place, it would follow that a change takes place in the dimensions of the place or of the thing placed, since it is impossible for two things to become newly one unless one of them is changed.

But if, as is the case in truth, no other dimensions belong to a place than those of the thing occupying the place, it is clear that the argument proves nothing, but begs the question, because according to this nothing else has been said but that the dimensions of a thing placed are the same as the dimensions of the place; excepting that the dimensions of the thing placed are contained within the bounds of the place, and that the distance between the bounds of a place is commensurate with the distance between the bounds of the thing placed, just as the former would be distant by their own dimensions if they had them. Thus that the dimensions of two bodies be the dimensions of one place is nothing else than that two bodies be in the same place, which is the chief question at issue.

#### Reply Obj. 2.
Granted that by a miracle two bodies be together in the same place, nothing follows either against common principles, or against the definition of a line, or against any conclusions of geometry. For, as stated above (a. 2), dimensive quantity differs from all other accidents in that it has a special reason of individuality and distinction, namely on account of the placing of the parts, besides the reason of individuality and distinction which is common to it and all other accidents, arising namely from the matter which is its subject. Thus then one line may be understood as being distinct from another, either because it is in another subject (in which case we are considering a material line), or because it is placed at a distance from another (in which case we are considering a mathematical line, which is understood apart from matter). Accordingly if we remove matter, there can be no distinction between lines save in respect of a different placing, and in like manner neither can there be a distinction of points, nor of surfaces, nor of any dimensions whatever. Consequently geometry cannot suppose one line to be added to another, as being distinct from it unless it is distinct as to place. But supposing by a Divine miracle a distinction of subject without a distinction of place, we can understand a distinction of lines; and these are not distant from one another in place, on account of the distinction of subjects.

Again we can understand a difference of points, and thus different lines described on two bodies that are in the same place are drawn from different points to different points; for the point that we take is not a point fixed in the place, but in the placed body, because a line is not said to be drawn otherwise than from a point which is its term. In like manner the two circles described in two spherical bodies that occupy the same place are two, not on account of the difference of place, for otherwise they could not touch one another as a whole, but on account of the distinction of subjects, and thus while wholly touching one another they still remain two. Even so a circle described by a placed spherical body touches, as a whole, the other circle described by the locating body.

#### Reply Obj. 3.
God could make a body not to be in a place; and yet supposing this, it would not follow that a certain body is not in a place, because the greater body is the place of the lesser body, by reason of its surface which is described by contact with the terms of the lesser body.

#### Reply Obj. 4.
It is impossible for one body to be miraculously in two places locally (for Christ’s body is not locally on the altar), although it is possible by a miracle for two bodies to be in the same place. Because to be in several places at once is incompatible with the individual, by reason of its having being undivided in itself, for it would follow that it is divided as to place. On the other hand, to be in the same place with another body is incompatible with the individual as distinct from anything else. Now the nature of unity is perfected in indivision^2, while distinction from others is a result of the nature of unity. Therefore that one same body be locally in several places at once implies a contradiction, even as for a man to lack reason, while for two bodies to be in the same place does not imply a contradiction, as explained above. Hence the comparison fails.

### Article 4. Whether One Glorified Body Can Be in the Same Place Together With Another Glorified Body?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that a glorified body can be in the same place together with another glorified body.

#### Objection 1.
Because where there is greater subtlety there is less resistance. If then a glorified body is more subtle than a non-glorified body, it will offer less resistance to a glorified body, and so if a glorified body can be in the same place with a non-glorified body, much more can it with a glorified body.

#### Obj. 2.
Further, Even as a glorified body will be more subtle than a non-glorified body, so will one glorified body be more subtle than another. Therefore if a glorified body can be in the same place with a non-glorified body, a more subtle glorified body can be in the same place with a less subtle glorified body.

#### Obj. 3.
Further, The body of heaven is subtle, and will then be glorified. Now the glorified body of a saint will be able to be in the same place with the body of heaven, since the saints will be able at will to travel to and from earth. Therefore two glorified bodies will be able to occupy the same place.

#### On the contrary,
The glorified bodies will be spiritual, that is like spirits in a certain respect. Now two spirits cannot be in the same place, although a body and a spirit can be in the same place, as stated above (I Sent., d. 37, Q. 3, A. 3; *Summa Theologica*, Part I, Q. 52, A. 3). Therefore neither will two glorified bodies be able to be in the same place.

#### Further,
If two bodies occupy the same place, one is penetrated by the other. But to be penetrated is a mark of imperfection which will be altogether absent from the glorified bodies. Therefore it will be impossible for two glorified bodies to be in the same place.

#### I answer that,
The property of a glorified body does not make it able to be in the same place with another glorified body, nor again to be in the same place with a non-glorified body. But it would be possible by the Divine power for two glorified bodies or two non-glorified bodies to be in the same place, even as a glorified body with a non-glorified body. Nevertheless it is not fitting for a glorified body to be in the same place with another glorified body, both because a becoming order will be observed in them, which demands distinction, and because one glorified body will not be in the way of another. Consequently two glorified bodies will never be in the same place.

#### Reply Obj. 1.
This argument supposes that a glorified body is able by reason of its subtlety to be in the same place with another body, and this is not true.

The same answer applies to the Second Objection.

#### Reply Obj. 3.
The body of heaven and the other bodies will be said equivocally to be glorified, in so far as they will have a certain share in glory, and not as though it were becoming for them to have the gifts of glorified human bodies.

### Article 5. Whether By Virtue of Its Subtlety a Glorified Body Will No Longer Need To Be in a Place Equal to Itself?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that by virtue of its subtlety a glorified body will no longer need to be in a place equal to itself.

#### Objection 1.
For the glorified bodies will be made like to the body of Christ according to Phil. 3:21. Now Christ’s body is not bound by this necessity of being in a place equal to itself; therefore it is contained whole under the small or great dimensions of a consecrated host. Therefore the same will be true of the glorified bodies.

#### Obj. 2.
Further, The Philosopher proves^3 that two bodies are not in the same place, because it would follow that the greatest body would occupy the smallest place, since its various parts could be in the same part of the place, for it makes no difference whether two bodies or however many be in the same place. Now a glorified body will be in the same place with another body, as is commonly admitted. Therefore it will be possible for it to be in any place however small.

#### Obj. 3.
Further, Even as a body is seen by reason of its colour, so is it measured by reason of its quantity. Now the glorified body will be so subject to the spirit that it will be able at will to be seen, and not seen, especially by a non-glorified eye, as evidenced in the case of Christ. Therefore its quantity will be so subject to the spirit’s will that it will be able to be in a little or great place, and to have a little or great quantity at will.

#### On the contrary,
The Philosopher says^4 that whatever is in a place is in a place equal to itself. Now the glorified body will be in a place. Therefore it will occupy a place equal to itself.

#### Further,
The dimensions of a place and of that which is in that place are the same, as shown in the *Physics*^5. Therefore if the place were larger than that which is in the place the same thing would be greater and smaller than itself, which is absurd.

#### I answer that,
A body is not related to place except through the medium of its proper dimensions, in respect of which a located body is confined through contact with the locating body. Hence it is not possible for a body to occupy a place smaller than its quantity, unless its proper quantity be made in some way less than itself, and this can only be understood in two ways. First, by a variation in quantity in respect of the same matter, so that in fact the matter which at first is subject to a greater quantity is afterwards subject to a lesser. Some have held this to be the case with the glorified bodies, saying that quantity is subject to them at will, so that at their will they are able to have a great quantity, and when they will a small quantity. But this is impossible, because no movement affecting that which is intrinsic to a thing is possible without passion to the detriment of its substance. Hence in incorruptible, that is heavenly, bodies, there is only local movement, which is not according to something intrinsic. Thus it is clear that change of quantity in respect of matter would be incompatible with the impassibility and incorruptibility of a glorified body. Moreover, it would follow that a glorified body would be sometimes rarer and sometimes denser, because since it cannot be deprived of any of its matter, sometimes the same matter would be under great dimensions and sometimes under small dimensions, and thus it would be rarefied and densified, which is impossible. Secondly, that the quantity of a glorified body become smaller than itself may be understood by a variation of place, in such a way, that is, that the parts of a glorified body insinuate themselves into one another, so that it is reduced in quantity however small it may become. And some have held this to be the case, saying that by reason of its subtlety a glorified body will be able to be in the same place with a non-glorified body, and that in like manner its parts can be one within the other, so much so that a whole glorified body will be able to pass through the minutest opening in another body, and thus they explain how Christ’s body came out of the Virgin’s womb; and how it went into His disciples, the doors being shut. But this is impossible, both because the glorified body will not be able, by reason of its subtlety, to be in the same place with another body, and because, even if it were able to be in the same place with another body, this would not be possible if the other were a glorified body, as many say; and again because this would be inconsistent with the right disposition of the human body, which requires the parts to be in a certain fixed place and at a certain fixed distance from one another. Therefore this will never happen, not even by a miracle. Consequently we must say that the glorified body will always be in a place equal to itself.

#### Reply Obj. 1.
Christ’s body is not locally in the Sacrament of the Altar, as stated above (IV Sent., d. 10, Q. 1, A. 1, Reply 5; *Summa Theologica*, Part III, Q. 76, A. 5).

#### Reply Obj. 2.
The Philosopher’s argument is that for the same reason one part might permeate another. But this permeation of the parts of a glorified body into one another is impossible, as stated above. Therefore the objection does not prove.

#### Reply Obj. 3.
A body is seen because it acts on the sight; but that it does or does not act on the sight causes no change in the body. Hence it is not unfitting that it can be seen when it will, and not seen when it will. On the other hand, being in a place is not an action proceeding from a body by reason of its quantity, as being seen is by reason of its colour. Consequently the comparison fails.

### Article 6. Whether the Glorified Body, By Reason of Its Subtlety, Will Be Impalpable?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that the glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, is impalpable.

#### Objection 1.
For Gregory says (*Hom. xxvi in Ev.*)^6:
> “What is palpable must be corruptible.”
But the glorified body is incorruptible. Therefore it is impalpable.

#### Obj. 2.
Further, Whatever is palpable resists one who handles it. But that which can be in the same place with another does not resist it. Since then a glorified body can be in the same place with another body, it will not be palpable.

#### Obj. 3.
Further, Every palpable body is tangible. Now every tangible body has tangible qualities in excess of the qualities of the one touching it. Since then in the glorified bodies the tangible qualities are not in excess but are reduced to a supreme degree of equality, it would seem that they are impalpable.

#### On the contrary,
Our Lord rose again with a glorified body; and yet His body was palpable, as appears from Luke 24:39:
> Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones.
Therefore the glorified bodies also will be palpable.

#### Further,
This is the heresy of Eutychius, Bishop of Constantinople^7, as Gregory states (*Moralia*, xiv, 56)^8, for he said that
> “in the glory of the resurrection our bodies will be impalpable.”

#### I answer that,
Every palpable body is tangible, but not conversely. For every body is tangible that has qualities whereby the sense of touch has a natural aptitude to be affected; and so air, fire, and the like are tangible bodies, but a palpable body, in addition to this, resists the touch; therefore the air which never resists that which passes through it, and is most easily pierced, is tangible indeed but not palpable.

Accordingly it is clear that a body is said to be palpable for two reasons, namely on account of its tangible qualities, and on account of its resisting that which touches it, so as to hinder it from piercing it. And since the tangible qualities are hot and cold and so forth, which are not found save in heavy and light bodies, which through being contrary to one another are therefore corruptible, it follows that the heavenly bodies, which by their nature are incorruptible, are sensible to the sight but not tangible, and therefore neither are they palpable. This is what Gregory means when he says (*loc. cit.*, Obj. 1) that “whatever is palpable must be corruptible.” Accordingly the glorified body has by its nature those qualities which have a natural aptitude to affect the touch, and yet since the body is altogether subject to the spirit, it is in its power thereby to affect or not to affect the touch. In like manner it is able by its nature to resist any other passing body, so that the latter cannot be in the same place together with it, although, according to its pleasure, it may happen by the Divine power that it occupy the same place with another body, and thus offer no resistance to a passing body. Therefore according to its nature the glorified body is palpable, but it is possible for it to be impalpable to a non-glorified body by a supernatural power. Hence Gregory says (*loc. cit.*) that “our Lord offered His flesh to be handled, which He had brought in through the closed doors, so as to afford a complete proof that after His resurrection His body was unchanged in nature though changed in glory.”

#### Reply Obj. 1.
The incorruptibility of a glorified body does not result from the nature of its component parts; and it is on account of that nature that whatever is palpable is corruptible, as stated above^9. Hence the argument does not prove.

#### Reply Obj. 2.
Although in a way it is possible for a glorified body to be in the same place with another body, nevertheless the glorified body has it in its power to resist at will any one touching it, and thus it is palpable.

#### Reply Obj. 3.
In the glorified bodies the tangible qualities are not reduced to the real mean that is measured according to equal distance from the extremes, but to the proportionate mean, according as is most becoming to the human complexion in each part. Therefore the touch of those bodies will be most delightful, because a power always delights in a becoming object, and is grieved by excess.

## QUESTION LXXXIV
### Of the agility of the bodies of the blessed
(In Three Articles)

We must now consider the agility of the bodies of the blessed in the resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
1.  Whether the glorified bodies will be agile?
2.  Whether they will move?
3.  Whether they will move instantaneously?

### Article 1. Whether the Glorified Bodies Will Be Agile?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the glorified bodies will not be agile.

#### Objection 1.
For that which is agile by itself needs not to be carried in order to move. But the glorified bodies will, after the resurrection, be taken up by the angels (according to a gloss)^10 in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air (1 Thess. 4:16). Therefore the glorified bodies will not be agile.

#### Obj. 2.
Further, No body that moves with labour and pain can be said to be agile. Yet the glorified bodies will move thus, since the principle of their movement, namely the soul, moves them counter to their nature, for otherwise they would always move in the same direction. Therefore they are not agile.

#### Obj. 3.
Further, Of all the animal operations sense surpasses movement in nobility and priority. Yet no property is ascribed to glorified bodies as perfecting them in sensation. Therefore neither should agility be ascribed to them as perfecting them in movement.

#### Obj. 4.
Further, Nature gives different animals instruments of different disposition according to their different powers; hence she does not give instruments of the same disposition to slow as to fleet animals. Now God’s works are much more orderly than those of nature. Since then the glorified body’s members will have the same disposition, shape and quantity as they now have, it would seem that it will have no agility other than it has now.

#### On the contrary,
It is written (1 Cor. 15:43):
> It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power,
that is, according to a gloss^11, “movable and living.” But mobility can only signify agility in movement. Therefore the glorified bodies will be agile.

#### Further,
Slowness of movement would seem especially inconsistent with the nature of a spirit. But the glorified bodies will be most spiritual according to 1 Cor. 15:44. Therefore they will be agile.

#### I answer that,
The glorified body will be altogether subject to the glorified soul, so that not only will there be nothing in it to resist the will of the spirit, for it was even so in the case of Adam’s body, but also from the glorified soul there will flow into the body a certain perfection, by which it will become adapted to that subjection, and this perfection is called “the gift” of the glorified body. Now the soul is united to body not only as its form, but also as its mover; and in both ways the glorified body has to be most perfectly subject to the glorified soul. Therefore even as by the gift of subtlety the body is wholly subject to the soul as its form, from which it derives its specific being, so by the gift of agility it is subject to the soul as its mover, so that it is prompt and apt to obey the spirit in all the movements and actions of the soul.

Some, however, ascribe the cause of this agility to the fifth, that is the heavenly essence, which will then be predominant in the glorified bodies. But of this we have frequently observed that it does not seem probable (Q. 82, A. 1; Q. 83, A. 1). Therefore it is better to ascribe it to the soul, from which glory flows to the body.

#### Reply Obj. 1.
Glorified bodies are said to be borne by the angels and also on the clouds, not as though they needed them, but in order to signify the reverence which both angels and all creatures will show them.

#### Reply Obj. 2.
The more the power of the moving soul dominates over the body, the less is the labour of movement, even though it be counter to the body’s nature. Hence those in whom the moving power is stronger, and those who through exercise have the body more adapted to obey the moving spirit, labour less in being moved. And since, after the resurrection, the soul will perfectly dominate the body, both on account of the perfection of its own power, and on account of the glorified body’s aptitude resulting from the outflow of glory which it receives from the soul, there will be no labour in the saints’ movements, and thus it may be said that the bodies of the saints will be agile.

#### Reply Obj. 3.
By the gift of agility the glorified body will be rendered apt not only for local movement but also for sensation, and for the execution of all the other operations of the soul.

#### Reply Obj. 4.
Even as nature gives to fleeter animals instruments of a different disposition in shape and quantity, so God will give to the bodies of the saints a disposition other than that which they have now, not indeed in shape and quantity, but in that property of glory which is called agility.

## Question LXXXIV

### Article 2. Whether the saints will always use their agility for the purpose of movement?

**We proceed thus to the Second Article:** It would seem that the saints will never use their agility for the purpose of movement.

**Objection 1.** For, according to the Philosopher,^1 “movement is the act of the imperfect.” But there will be no imperfection in glorified bodies. Neither therefore will there be any movement.

**Obj. 2.** Further, All movement is on account of some need, because whatever is in motion is moved for the sake of obtaining some end. But glorified bodies will have no need, since as Augustine says (*De Spiritu et Anima*, lxiii),^2 “all thou wiliest will be there, and nothing that thou wiliest not.” Therefore they will not move.

**Obj. 3.** Further, According to the Philosopher (*De Caelo et Mundo*, ii),^3 that which shares the Divine goodness without movement shares it more excellently than that which shares it with movement. Now the glorified body shares the Divine goodness more excellently than any other body. Since then certain bodies like the heavenly bodies, will remain altogether without movement, it seems that much more will human bodies remain so.

**Obj. 4.** Further, Augustine says (*De Vera Relig.* xii)^4 that the soul being established in God will in consequence establish its body. Now the soul will be so established in God, that in no way will it move away from Him. Therefore in the body there will be no movement caused by the soul.

**Obj. 5.** Further, The more noble a body is, the more noble a place is due to it; hence Christ’s body which is the most exalted of all has the highest place of all, according to Heb. 7:26, *Made higher than the heavens*, where a gloss says,^5 “in place and dignity.” And again each glorified body will, in like manner, have a place befitting it according to the measure of its dignity. Now a fitting place is one of the conditions pertaining to glory. Since then after the resurrection the glory of the saints will never vary, neither by increase nor by decrease, because they will then have reached the final term of all, it would seem that their bodies will never leave the place assigned to them, and consequently will not be moved.

**On the contrary**, It is written (Isa. 40:31): *They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint*; and (Wisd. 3:7): *The just shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds*. Therefore there will be some movement in glorified bodies.

**I answer that**, It is necessary to suppose that the glorified bodies are moved sometimes, since even Christ’s body was moved in His ascension, and likewise the bodies of the saints, which will arise from the earth, will ascend to the empyrean. But even after they have climbed the heavens, it is likely that they will sometimes move according as it pleases them, so that by actually putting into practice that which is in their power, they may show forth the excellence of Divine wisdom, and that furthermore their vision may be refreshed by the beauty of the variety of creatures, in which God’s wisdom will shine forth with great evidence; for sense can only perceive that which is present, although glorified bodies can perceive from a greater distance than non-glorified bodies. And yet movement will in no way diminish their happiness which consists in seeing God, for He will be everywhere present to them; thus Gregory says of the angels (*Hom. xxxiv in Ev.*)^6 that “wherever they are sent their course lies in God.”

**Reply Obj. 1.** Local movement changes nothing that is intrinsic to a thing, but only that which is without, namely place. Hence that which is moved locally is perfect as to those things which are within,^7 although it has an imperfection as to place, because while it is in one place it is in potency with regard to another place, since it cannot be in several places at the same time, for this belongs to God alone. But this defect is not inconsistent with the perfection of glory, as neither is the defect whereby a creature is formed from nothing. Hence such defects will remain in glorified bodies.

**Reply Obj. 2.** A person is said to need a thing in two ways, namely absolutely and relatively. One needs absolutely that without which one cannot retain one’s being or one’s perfection, and thus movement in glorified bodies will not be on account of a need, because their happiness will suffice them for all such things. But we need a thing relatively when without it some end we have in view cannot be obtained by us, or not so well, or not in some particular way. It is thus that movement will be in the blessed on account of need, for they will be unable to show forth their moving power in actual practice unless they are in motion, since nothing prevents a need of this kind being in glorified bodies.

**Reply Obj. 3.** This argument would prove if the glorified body were unable even without movement to share the Divine goodness much more perfectly than the heavenly bodies, which is untrue. Hence glorified bodies will be moved, not in order to gain a perfect participation in the Divine goodness (since they have this through glory), but in order to show the soul’s power. On the other hand, the movement of the heavenly bodies could not show their power except the power they have in moving lower bodies to generation and corruption, which is not becoming to that state. Hence the argument does not prove.

**Reply Obj. 4.** Local movement takes nothing away from the stability of the soul that is established in God, since it does not affect that which is intrinsic to a thing, as stated above (Reply 1).

**Reply Obj. 5.** The fitting place assigned to each glorified body according to the degree of its dignity belongs to the accidental reward. Nor does it follow that this reward is diminished whenever the body is outside its place, because that place pertains to reward not as actually containing the body located there (since nothing flows from it into the glorified body, but rather does it receive splendour from the glorified body), but as being due to merits. Therefore, though out of that place, they will still continue to rejoice in it.

### Article 3. Whether the Movement of the Saints Will Be Instantaneous?

**We proceed thus to the Third Article:** It would seem that the movement of the saints will be instantaneous.

**Objection 1.** For Augustine says^8 that “wherever the spirit wills there will the body be.” Now the movement of the will, according to which the spirit wishes to be anywhere, is instantaneous. Therefore the body’s movement will be instantaneous.

**Obj. 2.** Further, The Philosopher^9 proves that there is no movement through a vacuum, because it would follow that something moves instantaneously, since a vacuum offers no resistance whatever to a thing that is in motion, whereas the plenum offers resistance; and so there would be no proportion between the speed of movement in a vacuum and that of movement in a plenum, since the ratio of movements in point of speed is as the ratio of the resistance offered by the medium. Now the velocities of any two movements that take place in time must be proportional, since any one space of time is proportional to any other. But in like manner no full place can resist a glorified body since this can be in the same place with another body, no matter how this may occur; even as neither can a vacuum resist a body. Therefore if it moves at all, it moves instantaneously.

**Obj. 3.** Further, The power of a glorified soul surpasses the power of a non-glorified soul, out of all proportion so to speak. Now the non-glorified soul moves the body in time. Therefore the glorified soul moves the body instantaneously.

**Obj. 4.** Further, Whatever is moved equally soon to what is near and what is distant, is moved instantaneously. Now such is the movement of a glorified body, for however distant the space to which it is moved, the time it takes to be moved is imperceptible; hence Augustine says (*QQ. De Resurrectione, Ep. cii, Q. i*)^10 that the glorified body “reaches equally soon to any distance, like the sun’s ray.” Therefore the glorified body is moved instantaneously.

**Obj. 5.** Further, Whatever is in motion is moved either in time or in an instant. Now after the resurrection the glorified body will not be moved in time, since time will not be then according to Apoc. 10:6. Therefore this movement will be instantaneous.

**On the contrary**, In local movement space, movement and time are equally divisible, as is demonstrated in the *Physics*.^11 Now the space traversed by a glorified body in motion is divisible. Therefore both the movement and the time are divisible. But an instant is indivisible. Therefore this movement will not be instantaneous.

**Further**, A thing cannot be at the same time wholly in one place and partly in another place, since it would follow that the remaining part is in two places at the same time, which is impossible. But whatever is in motion is partly in a term from which and partly in a term to which, as is proved in the *Physics*^12 while whatever has been in motion is wholly in the term to which the movement is directed, and it is impossible at the same time for it to be moved and to have been moved. Now that which is moved instantaneously is being moved and has been moved at the same time. Therefore the local movement of a glorified body cannot be instantaneous.

**I answer that**, Opinion is much divided on this point. For some say that a glorified body passes from one place to another without passing through the interval, just as the will passes from one place to another without passing through the interval, and that consequently it is possible for the movement of a glorified body like that of the will to be instantaneous. But this will not hold, because the glorified body will never attain to the dignity of the spiritual nature, just as it will never cease to be a body. Moreover, when the will is said to move from one place to another, it is not essentially transferred from place to place, because in neither place is it contained essentially, but it is directed to one place after being directed by the intention to another, and in this sense it is said to move from one place to another.

Hence others say that it is a property of the nature of a glorified body, since it is a body, to pass through the interval and consequently to be moved in time, but that by the power of glory, which raises it to a certain infinitude above the power of nature, it is possible for it not to pass through the interval, and consequently to be moved instantaneously. But this is impossible, since it implies a contradiction, which is proved as follows. Suppose a body which we will call Z to be in motion from A to B. It is clear that Z, as long as it is wholly in A is not in motion; and in like manner when it is wholly in B, because then the movement is past. Therefore if it is at any time in motion it must be neither wholly in A nor wholly in B. Therefore while it is in motion, it is either nowhere, or partly in A and partly in B, or wholly in some other intervening place, say C, or partly in A and C and partly in C and B. But it is impossible for it to be nowhere, for then there would be a dimensive quantity without a place, which is impossible. Nor again is it possible for it to be partly in A and partly in B without being in some way in the intervening space; for since B is a place distant from A, it would follow that in the intervening space the part of Z which is in B is not continuous with the part which is in A. Therefore it follows that it is either wholly in C, or partly in C, and partly in some other place that intervenes between C and A, say D, and so forth. Therefore it follows that Z does not pass from A to B unless first of all it be in all the intervening places, unless we suppose that it passes from A to B without ever being moved, which implies a contradiction, because the very succession of places is local movement. The same applies to any change whatever having two opposite terms, each of which is something positive, but not to those changes which have only one positive term, the other being a pure privation, since between affirmation and negation or privation there is no fixed distance; and so that which is in the negation may be nearer to or more remote from affirmation, and conversely, by reason of something that causes either of them or disposes thereto, so that while that which is moved is wholly under a negation it is changed into affirmation, and vice versa; therefore in such things to be changing precedes to be changed, as is proved in the *Physics*.^13 Nor is there any comparison with the movement of an angel, because being in a place is predicated equivocally of a body and an angel. Hence it is clear that it is altogether impossible for a body to pass from one place to another, unless it pass through every interval.

And therefore others grant this, and yet they maintain that the glorified body is moved instantaneously. But it follows from this that a glorified body is at the same instant in two or more places together, namely in the ultimate term, and in all the intervening places, which is impossible. To this, however, they reply that, although it is the same instant really, it is not the same logically, like a point at which different lines terminate. But this is not enough, because an instant measures the instantaneous, according to its reality and not according to our way of considering it. Therefore an instant through being considered in a different way is not rendered capable of measuring things that are not simultaneous in time, just as a point through being considered in a different way does not make it possible for one point of place to contain things that are locally distant from one another.

Hence others with greater probability hold that a glorified body moves in time, but that this time is so short as to be imperceptible; and that nevertheless one glorified body can pass through the same space in less time than another, because there is no limit to the divisibility of time, no matter how short a space we may take.

**Reply Obj. 1.** “That which is little lacking is as it were not lacking at all,” as it is stated in the *Physics*.^14 Therefore we say: “I do so and so at once,” when it is to be done after a short time. It is in this sense that Augustine speaks when he says that “wheresoever the will shall be, there shall the body be at once.” Or we may say that in the blessed there will never be a disordered will, so that they never will wish their body to be instantaneously where it cannot be, and consequently whatever instant the will shall choose, at that same instant the body will be in whatever place the will shall determine.

**Reply Obj. 2.** Some have demurred to this proposition of the Philosopher’s, as the Commentator thereon observes.^15 They say that the ratio of one whole movement to another whole movement is not necessarily as the ratio of one resisting medium to another resisting medium, but that the ratio of the intervening mediums gives us the ratio of retardations attending the movements on account of the resistance of the medium. For every movement has a certain fixed speed, either fast or slow, through the mover overcoming the movable, even if there is no resistance on the part of the medium, as is clear in the case of heavenly bodies, which have nothing to hinder their movement; and yet they do not move instantaneously, but in a fixed time proportionate to the power of the mover in comparison with the movable. Consequently it is clear that even if we suppose something to move in a vacuum, it does not follow that it moves instantaneously, but that nothing is added to the time which that movement requires in the aforesaid proportion of the mover to the movable, because the movement is not retarded.

But this reply, as the Commentator observes (*ibid*.), proceeds from an error in the imagination; for it is imagined that the retardation resulting from the resistance of the medium is a part of movement added to the natural movement, the quantity of which is in proportion to the mover in comparison with the movable, as when one line is added to another, for the proportion of one total to the other is not the same as the proportion of the lines to which an addition has been made.^16 And so there would not be the same proportion between one whole sensible movement and another, as between the retardations resulting from the resistance of the medium. This is an error of the imagination, because each part of a movement has as much speed as the whole movement, while not every part of a line has as much of the dimensive quantity as the whole line has. Hence any retardation or acceleration affecting the movement affects each of its parts, which is not the case with lines, and consequently the retardation that comes to a movement is not another part of the movement, whereas in the case of the lines that which is added is a part of the total line.

Consequently, in order to understand the Philosopher’s argument, as the Commentator explains (*ibid*.), we must take the whole as being one, that is we must take not only the resistance of the movable to the moving power, but also the resistance of the medium through which the movement takes place, and again the resistance of anything else, so that we take the amount of retardation in the whole movement as being proportionate to the moving power in comparison with the resisting movable, no matter in what way it resist, whether by itself or by reason of something extrinsic. For the movable must always resist the mover somewhat, since mover and moved, agent and patient, as such, are opposed to one another. Now sometimes it is to be observed that the moved resists the mover by itself, either because it has a force inclining it to a contrary movement, as appears in violent movements, or at least because it has a place contrary to the place which is in the intention of the mover; and resistance of this kind even heavenly bodies offer their movers. Sometimes the movable resists the power of the mover by reason only of something else and not by itself. This is seen in the natural movement of heavy and light things, because by their very form they are inclined to such a movement, for the form is an impression of their generator, which is the mover as regards heavy and light bodies. On the part of matter we find no resistance, neither of a force inclining to a contrary movement nor of a contrary place, since place is not due to matter except in so far as the latter, being circumscribed by its dimensions, is perfected by its natural form. Hence there can be no resistance save on the part of the medium, and this resistance is connatural to their movement. Sometimes again the resistance results from both, as may be seen in the movements of animals.

Accordingly when in a movement there is no resistance save on the part of the movable, as in the heavenly bodies, the time of the movement is measured according to the proportion of the mover to the movable, and the Philosopher’s argument does not apply to these, since if there be no medium at all their movement is still a movement in time. On the other hand, in those movements where there is resistance on the part of the medium only, the measure of time is taken only according to the obstacle on the part of the medium, so that if the medium be removed there will be no longer an obstacle; and so either it will move instantaneously, or it will move in an equal time through a vacuum and through a plenum, because granted that it moves in time through a vacuum, that time will bear some proportion to the time in which it moves through a plenum.

Now it is possible to imagine another body more subtle in the same proportion than the body which filled the space, and then if this body fill some other equal space it will move in as little time through that plenum as it did previously through a vacuum, since by as much as the subtlety of the medium is increased by so much is the length of time decreased, and the more subtle the medium the less it resists. But in those other movements where resistance is offered by both the movable and the medium, the quantity of time must be proportionate to the power of the mover as compared with the resistance of both movable and medium together. Hence granted that the medium be taken away altogether, or that it cease to hinder, it does not follow that the movement is instantaneous, but that the time is measured according only to the resistance of the movable. Nor will there be any inconsistency if it move in an equal time through a vacuum, and through a space filled with the most subtle body imaginable, since the greater the subtlety we ascribe to the medium the less is it naturally inclined to retard the movement. Therefore it is possible to imagine so great a subtlety as will naturally retard the movement less than does the resistance of the movable, so that the resistance of the medium will add no retardation to the movement.

It is therefore evident that although the medium offer no resistance to the glorified bodies, in so far as it is possible for them to be in the same place with another body, nevertheless their movement will not be instantaneous, because the movable body itself will resist the moving power, from the very fact that it has a determinate place, as we have said in reference to the heavenly bodies.

**Reply Obj. 3.** Although the power of a glorified soul surpasses immeasurably the power of a non-glorified soul, it does not surpass it infinitely, because both powers are finite; hence it does not follow that it causes instantaneous movement. And even if its power were absolutely infinite, it would not follow that it causes an instantaneous movement, unless the resistance of the movable were overcome altogether. Now although the resistance of the movable to the mover that results from opposition to such a movement by reason of its being inclined to a contrary movement, can be altogether overcome by a mover of infinite power, nevertheless the resistance it offers through contrariety towards the place which the mover intends by the movement cannot be overcome altogether, except by depriving it of its being in such and such a place or position. For just as white resists black by reason of whiteness, and all the more according as whiteness is the more distant from blackness, so a body resists a certain place through having an opposite place, and its resistance is all the greater according as the distance is greater. Now it is impossible to take away from a body its being in some place or position, unless one deprive it of its corporeity, by reason of which it requires a place or position; therefore so long as it retains the nature of a body, it can in no way be moved instantaneously, however greater be the moving power. Now the glorified body will never lose its corporeity, and therefore it will never be possible for it to be moved instantaneously.

**Reply Obj. 4.** In the words of Augustine, the speed is said to be equal because the excess of one over the other is imperceptible, just as the time taken by the whole movement is imperceptible.

**Reply Obj. 5.** Although after the resurrection the time which is the measure of the heaven’s movement will be no more, there will nevertheless be time resulting from the before and after in any kind of movement.

## Question LXXXV
### Of the clarity of the bodies of the blessed
(In Three Articles)

We must now consider the clarity of the bodies of the blessed at the resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
1.  Whether there will be clarity in the glorified bodies?
2.  Whether this clarity will be visible to the non-glorified eye?
3.  Whether a glorified body will of necessity be seen by a non-glorified body?

### Article 1. Whether Clarity Is Becoming to the Glorified Body?

**We proceed thus to the First Article:** It would seem that clarity is unbecoming to the glorified body.

**Objection 1.** Because according to Avicenna (*Naturales, vi, 3*),^17 “every luminous body consists of transparent parts.” But the parts of a glorified body will not be transparent, since in some of them, such as flesh and bones, earth is predominant. Therefore glorified bodies are not lightsome.

**Obj. 2.** Further, Every lightsome body hides one that is behind it; therefore one luminary behind another is eclipsed, and a flame of fire prevents one seeing what is behind it. But the glorified bodies will not hide that which is within them, for as Gregory says on Job 28:17, *Gold or crystal cannot equal it* (*Moralia, xviii, 48*)^18: “There,” that is in the heavenly country, “the grossness of the members will not hide one’s mind from another’s eyes, and the very harmony of the body will be evident to the bodily sight.” Therefore those bodies will not be lightsome.

**Obj. 3.** Further, Light and colour require a contrary disposition in their subject, since “light is the extreme point of visibility in an indeterminate body; colour in a determinate body.”^19 But glorified bodies will have colour, for as Augustine says,^20 “the body’s beauty is harmony of parts with a certain charm of colour,” and it will be impossible for the glorified bodies to lack beauty. Therefore the glorified bodies will not be lightsome.

**Obj. 4.** Further, If there be clarity in the glorified bodies, it will need to be equal in all the parts of the body, just as all the parts will be equally impassible, subtle and agile. But this is not becoming, since one part has a greater disposition to clarity than another, for instance the eye than the hand, the spirits than the bones, the humours than the flesh or nerves. Therefore it would seem unfitting for those bodies to be lightsome.

**On the contrary**, It is written (Matt. 13:43): *The just shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father*, and (Wisd. 3:7): *The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds*.

**Further**, It is written (1 Cor. 15:43): *It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory*, which refers to clarity, as evidenced by the previous

context where the glory of the rising bodies is compared to the clarity of the stars. Therefore the bodies of the saints will be lightsome.

I answer that: It is necessary to assert that after the resurrection the bodies of the saints will be lightsome, on account of the authority of Scripture which makes this promise. But the cause of this clarity is ascribed by some to the fifth or heavenly essence, which will then predominate in the human body. Since, however, this is absurd, as we have often remarked (Q. 84, Art. 1), it is better to say that this clarity will result from the overflow of the soul’s glory into the body. For whatever is received into anything is received not according to the mode of the source from which it flows, but according to the mode of the recipient. Therefore clarity which in the soul is spiritual is received into the body as corporeal. And consequently according to the greater clarity of the soul by reason of its greater merit, so too will the body differ in clarity, as the Apostle affirms (1 Corinthians 15:41). Thus in the glorified body the glory of the soul will be known, even as through a crystal is known the colour of a body contained in a crystal vessel, as Gregory says[^1] on Job 28:17, "Gold or crystal cannot equal it."

Reply Obj. 1. Avicenna is speaking of a body that has clarity through the nature of its component parts. It is not thus but rather by the merit of virtue that the glorified body will have clarity.

Reply Obj. 2. Gregory compares the glorified body to gold on account of clarity, and to crystal on account of its transparency. Therefore it seems we should say that they will be both transparent and lightsome; for that a lightsome body is not transparent is owing to the fact that the clarity of that body results from the density of the lightsome parts, and density is opposed to transparency. Then, however, clarity will result from another cause, as stated above, and the density of the glorified body will not deprive it of transparency, as neither does the density of a crystal deprive crystal.

Some, on the other hand, say that they are compared to crystal not because they are transparent, but on account of this likeness, for just as that which is enclosed in crystal is visible, so the glory of the soul enclosed in the glorified body will not be hidden. But the first explanation is better, because it safeguards better the dignity of the glorified body, and is more consistent with the words of Gregory.

Reply Obj. 3. The glory of the body will not destroy nature but will perfect it. Therefore the body will retain the colour due to it by reason of the nature of its component parts, but in addition to this it will have clarity resulting from the soul’s glory. Thus we see bodies which have colour by their nature aglow with the resplendence of the sun, or from some other cause extrinsic or intrinsic.

Reply Obj. 4. Even as the clarity of glory will overflow from the soul into the body according to the mode of the body, and is there otherwise than in the soul, so again it will overflow into each part of the soul according to the mode of that part. Hence it is not unreasonable that the different parts should have clarity in different ways, according as they are differently disposed thereto by their nature. Nor is there any comparison with the other gifts of the body, for the various parts of the body are not differently disposed in their regard.

## Article 2. Whether the Clarity of the Glorified Body Is Visible to the Non-Glorified Eye?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the clarity of the glorified body is invisible to the non-glorified eye.

Objection 1. For the visible object should be proportionate to the sight. But a non-glorified eye is not proportionate to see the clarity of glory, since this differs generically from the clarity of nature. Therefore the clarity of the glorified body will not be seen by a non-glorified eye.

Obj. 2. Further, The clarity of the glorified body will be greater than the clarity of the sun is now, since the clarity of the sun also will then be greater than it is now, as it is said,[^2] and the clarity of the glorified body will be much greater still, for which reason the sun and the entire world will receive greater clarity. Now a non-glorified eye is unable to gaze on the very orb of the sun on account of the greatness of its clarity. Therefore still less will it be able to gaze on the clarity of a glorified body.

Obj. 3. Further, A visible object that is opposite the eyes of the seer must be seen, unless there is some lesion to the eye. But the clarity of a glorified body that is opposite to non-glorified eyes is not necessarily seen by them, which is evident in the case of the disciples who saw our Lord’s body after the resurrection, without witnessing its clarity. Therefore this clarity will be invisible to a non-glorified eye.

On the contrary: A gloss on Philippians 3:21, "*Made like to the body of His glory*," says:[^3] "It will be like the clarity which He had in the Transfiguration." Now this clarity was seen by the non-glorified eyes of the disciples. Therefore the clarity of the glorified body will be visible to non-glorified eyes also.

Further: The wicked will be tortured in the judgment by seeing the glory of the just, according to Wisdom 5:2. But they would not fully see their glory unless they gazed on their clarity. Therefore, etc.

I answer that: Some have asserted that the clarity of the glorified body will not be visible to the non-glorified eye, except by a miracle. But this is impossible, unless this clarity were so named equivocally, because light by its essence has a natural tendency to move the sight, and sight by its essence has a natural tendency to perceive light, even as the true is in relation to the intellect, and the good to the appetite. Therefore if there were a sight altogether incapable of perceiving a light, either this sight is so named equivocally, or else this light is. This cannot be said in the point at issue, because then nothing would be made known to us when we are told that the glorified bodies will be lightsome; in the same way a person who says that a dog (the dog star) is in the heavens conveys no knowledge to one who knows no other dog than the animal. Hence we must say that the clarity of a glorified body is naturally visible to the non-glorified eye.

Reply Obj. 1. The clarity of glory will differ generically from the clarity of nature as to its cause but not as to its species. Hence just as the clarity of nature is, by reason of its species, proportionate to the sight, so too will the clarity of glory be.

Reply Obj. 2. Just as a glorified body is not passible to a passion of nature but only to a passion of the soul, so in virtue of its property of glory it acts only by the action of the soul. Now intense clarity does not disturb the sight, in so far as it acts by the action of the soul, for thus it rather gives delight, but it disturbs it in so far as it acts by the action of nature by heating and destroying the organ of sight, and by scattering the spirits asunder. Hence, though the clarity of a glorified body surpasses the clarity of the sun, it does not by its nature disturb the sight but soothes it. Therefore this clarity is compared to the jasper-stone (Revelation 21:11).

Reply Obj. 3. The clarity of the glorified body results from the merit of the will and therefore will be subject to the will, so as to be seen or not seen according to its command. Therefore it will be in the power of the glorified body to show forth its clarity or to hide it, and this was the opinion of Praepositinus.[^4]

## Article 3. Whether a Glorified Body Will Be Necessarily Seen By a Non-Glorified Body?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that a glorified body will be necessarily seen by a non-glorified body.

Objection 1. For the glorified bodies will be lightsome. Now a lightsome body reveals itself and other things. Therefore the glorified bodies will be seen of necessity.

Obj. 2. Further, Every body which hides other bodies that are behind it is necessarily perceived by the sight, from the very fact that the other things behind it are hidden. Now the glorified body will hide other bodies that are behind it from being seen, because it will be a coloured body. Therefore it will be seen of necessity.

Obj. 3. Further, Just as quantity is something in a body, so is the quality by which a body is seen. Now quantity will not be subject to the will, so that the glorified body be able to be of greater or smaller quantity. Therefore neither will the quality of visibility be subject to the will, so that a body be able not to be seen.

On the contrary: Our body will be glorified in being made like to the body of Christ after the resurrection. Now after the resurrection Christ’s body was not necessarily seen; in fact it vanished from the sight of the disciples at Emmaus (Luke 24:31). Therefore neither will the glorified body be necessarily seen.

Further: There the body will be in complete obedience to the will. Therefore as the soul wills the body will be visible or invisible.

I answer that: A visible object is seen according as it acts on the sight. Now there is no change in a thing through its acting or not acting on an external object. Therefore a glorified body may be seen or not seen without any property pertaining to its perfection being changed. Consequently it will be in the power of a glorified soul for its body to be seen or not seen, even as any other action of the body will be in the soul’s power; otherwise the glorified body would not be a perfectly obedient instrument of its principal agent.

Reply Obj. 1. This clarity will be obedient to the glorified body so that this will be able to show it or hide it.

Reply Obj. 2. A body’s colour does not prevent its being transparent except in so far as it affects the sight, because the sight cannot be affected by two colours at the same time, so as to perceive them both perfectly. But the colour of the glorified body will be completely in the power of the soul, so that it can thereby act or not act on the sight. Hence it will be in its power to hide or not to hide a body that is behind it.

Reply Obj. 3. Quantity is inherent to the glorified body itself, nor would it be possible for the quantity to be altered at the soul’s bidding without the glorified body suffering some alteration incompatible with its impassibility. Hence there is no comparison between quantity and visibility, because even this quality whereby it is visible cannot be removed at the soul’s bidding, but the action of that quality will be suspended, and thus the body will be hidden at the soul’s command.

# Question 86
**Of the Conditions Under Which the Bodies of the Damned Will Rise Again**
(In Three Articles)

We must next consider the conditions in which the bodies of the damned will rise again. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
1.  Whether the bodies of the damned will rise again with their deformities?
2.  Whether their bodies will be corruptible?
3.  Whether they will be impassible?

## Article 1. Whether the Bodies of the Damned Will Rise Again With Their Deformities?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the bodies of the damned will rise again with their deformities.

Objection 1. For that which was appointed as a punishment for sin should not cease unless the sin is forgiven. Now the lack of limbs that results from mutilation, as well as all other bodily deformities, are appointed as punishments for sin. Therefore these deformities will not be taken away from the damned, seeing that they will not have received the forgiveness of their sins.

Obj. 2. Further, Just as the saints will rise again to final happiness, so the wicked will rise again to final unhappiness. Now when the saints rise again nothing will be taken from them that can pertain to their perfection, and therefore nothing pertaining to the defect or unhappiness of the wicked will be taken from them at the resurrection. But such are their deformities. Therefore, etc.

Obj. 3. Further, Just as deformity is a defect of the passible body, so is slowness of movement. Now slowness of movement will not be taken from the bodies of the damned at the resurrection, since their bodies will not be agile. Therefore for the same reason neither will their deformity be taken away.

On the contrary: It is written (1 Corinthians 15:52): "*The dead shall rise again incorruptible*"; where a gloss says:[^5] "The dead, that is sinners, or all the dead in general shall rise again incorruptible, that is without the loss of any limbs." Therefore the wicked will rise again without their deformities.

Further: There will be nothing in the damned to lessen the sense of pain. But sickness hinders the sense of pain by weakening the organ of sense, and in like manner the lack of a limb would prevent pain from affecting the whole body. Therefore the damned will rise again without these defects.

I answer that: Deformity in the human body is of two kinds. One arises from the lack of a limb; thus we say that a mutilated person is deformed, because he lacks due proportion of the parts to the whole. Deformities of this kind, without any doubt, will not be in the bodies of the damned, since all bodies of both wicked and good will rise again whole. Another deformity arises from the undue disposition of the parts, by reason of undue quantity, quality, or place,—which deformity is, moreover, incompatible with due proportion of parts to whole. Concerning these deformities and like defects such as fevers and similar ailments which sometimes result in deformity, Augustine remained undecided and doubtful (*Enchiridion* XCII)[^13] as the Master remarks (*Sentences*, IV, d. 44).[^14] Among modern masters, however, there are two opinions on this point.

For some say that such deformities and defects will remain in the bodies of the damned, because they consider that those who are damned are sentenced to utmost unhappiness, from which no affliction should be taken away. But this would seem unreasonable. For in the restoration of the rising body we look to its natural perfection rather than to its previous condition; hence those who die under perfect age will rise again in the stature of youth, as stated above (Q. 81, Art. 1). Consequently those who had natural defects in the body, or deformities resulting from them, will be restored without those defects or deformities at the resurrection, unless the demerit of sin prevent; and so if a person rise again with such defects and deformities, this will be for his punishment. Now the mode of punishment is according to the measure of guilt. And a sinner who is about to be damned may be burdened with less grievous sins and yet have deformities and defects which one who is about to be damned has not, while burdened with more grievous sins. Therefore if he who had deformities in this life rise again with them, while the other who had them not in this life, and therefore, as is clear, will rise again without them, though deserving of greater punishment, the mode of the punishment would not correspond to the amount of guilt; in fact it would seem that a man is more punished on account of the pains which he suffered in this world, which is absurd.

Hence others say with more reason, that He Who fashioned nature will wholly restore the body’s nature at the resurrection. Therefore whatever defect or deformity was in the body through corruption, or weakness of nature or of natural principles (for instance fever, partial blindness, and so forth) will be entirely done away at the resurrection, whereas those defects in the human body which are the natural result of its natural principles, such as heaviness, passibility, and the like, will be in the bodies of the damned, while they will be removed from the bodies of the elect by the glory of the resurrection.

Reply Obj. 1. Since in every tribunal punishment is inflicted according to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, the punishments which in this temporal life are inflicted for some particular sin are themselves temporal, and do not extend beyond the term of this life. Hence although the damned are not pardoned their sins, it does not follow that there they will undergo the same punishments as they have in this world; but the Divine justice demands that there they shall suffer more severe punishment for eternity.

Reply Obj. 2. There is no parity between the good and the wicked, because a thing can be altogether good, but not altogether evil. Hence the final happiness of the saints requires that they should be altogether exempt from all evil, whereas the final unhappiness of the wicked will not exclude all good, because "if a thing be wholly evil it destroys itself," as the Philosopher says.[^6] Hence it is necessary for the good of their nature to underlie the unhappiness of the damned, which good is the work of their perfect Creator, Who will restore that same nature to the perfection of its species.

Reply Obj. 3. Slowness of movement is one of those defects which are the natural result of the principles of the human body; but deformity is not, and consequently the comparison fails.

## Article 2. Whether the Bodies of the Damned Will Be Incorruptible?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the bodies of the damned will be corruptible.

Objection 1. For everything composed of contraries must necessarily be corruptible. Now the bodies of the damned will be composed of the contraries of which they are composed even now, for otherwise they would not be the same, neither specifically nor, in consequence, numerically. Therefore they will be corruptible.

Obj. 2. Further, If the bodies of the damned will not be corruptible, this will be due either to nature, or to grace, or to glory. But it will not be by nature, since they will be of the same nature as now; nor will it be by grace or glory, since they will lack these things altogether. Therefore they will be corruptible.

Obj. 3. Further, It would seem inconsistent to withdraw the greatest of punishments from those who are in the highest degree of unhappiness. Now death is the greatest of punishments, as the Philosopher declares.[^7] Therefore death should not be withdrawn from the damned, since they are in the highest degree of unhappiness. Therefore their bodies will be corruptible.

On the contrary: It is written (Revelation 9:6): "*In those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it; and they shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them.*"

Further: The damned will be punished with an everlasting punishment both in soul and body (Matthew 25:46): "*These shall go into everlasting punishment.*" But this would not be possible if their bodies were corruptible. Therefore their bodies will be incorruptible.

I answer that: Since in every movement there must be a principle of movement, movement or change may be withdrawn from a movable in two ways: first through absence of a principle of movement, secondly through an obstacle to the principle of movement. Now corruption is a kind of change, and consequently a body which is corruptible on account of the nature of its principles may be rendered incorruptible in two ways. First by the total removal of the principle which leads to corruption, and in this way the bodies of the damned will be incorruptible. For since the heaven is the first principle of alteration in virtue of its local movement, and all other secondary agents act in virtue of it and as though moved by it, it follows that at the cessation of the heavenly movement there is no longer any agent that can change the body by altering it from its natural property. Therefore after the resurrection, and the cessation of the heavenly movement, there will be no quality capable of altering the human body from its natural quality. Now corruption, like generation, is the term of alteration. Hence the bodies of the damned will be incorruptible, and this will serve the purpose of Divine justice, since living for ever they will be punished for ever. This is in keeping with the demands of Divine justice, as we shall state further on (Art. 3; Q. 99, Art. 1), even as now the corruptibility of bodies serves the purpose of Divine providence, by which through the corruption of one thing another is generated.

Secondly, this happens through the principle of corruption being hindered, and in this way the body of Adam was incorruptible, because the conflicting qualities that exist in man’s body were withheld by the grace of innocence from conducing to the body’s dissolution, and much more will they be withheld in the glorified bodies, which will be wholly subject to the spirit. Thus after the general resurrection the two above modes of incorruptibility will be united together in the bodies of the blessed.

Reply Obj. 1. The contraries of which bodies are composed are conducive to corruption as secondary principles. For their first active principle is the heavenly movement. Therefore given the movement of the heaven, it is necessary for a body composed of contraries to be corrupted unless some more powerful cause prevent it, whereas if the heavenly movement be withdrawn, the contraries of which a body is composed do not suffice to cause corruption, even in accordance with nature, as explained above. But the philosophers were ignorant of a cessation in the heavenly movement, and consequently they held that a body composed of contraries is without fail corrupted in accordance with nature.

Reply Obj. 2. This incorruptibility will result from nature, not as though there were some principle of incorruption in the bodies of the damned, but on account of the cessation of the active principle of corruption, as shown above.

Reply Obj. 3. Although death is the greatest of punishments absolutely, yet nothing prevents death conducing, in a certain respect, to a cessation of punishments; and consequently the removal of death may contribute to the increase of punishment. For as the Philosopher says,[^8] "Life is pleasant to all, for all desire to be . . . But we must not apply this to a wicked or corrupt life, nor one passed in sorrow." Accordingly just as life is pleasant absolutely, but not the life that is passed in sorrows, so too death, which is the privation of life, is painful absolutely, and the greatest of punishments, since it deprives one of the primary good, namely being, with which other things are withdrawn. But in so far as it deprives one of a wicked life, and of such as is passed in sorrow, it is a remedy for pains, since it puts an end to them; and consequently the withdrawal of death leads to the increase of punishments by making them everlasting. If however we say that death is penal by reason of the bodily pain which the dying feel, without doubt the damned will continue to feel a far greater pain. Therefore they are said to be in everlasting death, according to Psalm 48:15: "*Death shall feed upon them.*"

## Article 3. Whether the Bodies of the Damned Will Be Impassible?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the bodies of the damned will be impassible.

Objection 1. For, according to the Philosopher,[^9] "increase of passion results in loss of substance." Now "if a finite thing be continually lessened, it must at length be done away."[^10] Therefore if the bodies of the damned will be passible, and will be always suffering, they will at length be done away and corrupted, and this has been shown to be false (Art. 2). Therefore they will be impassible.

Obj. 2. Further, Every agent likens the patient to itself. If then the bodies of the damned are passive to the fire the fire will liken them to itself. Now fire does not consume bodies except in so far as in likening them to itself it disintegrates them. Therefore if the bodies of the damned will be passible they will at length be consumed by the fire, and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

Obj. 3. Further, Those animals, for instance the salamander, which are said to remain living in fire without being destroyed,[^11] are not distressed by the fire, because an animal is not distressed by bodily pain unless the body in some way is hurt thereby. If therefore the bodies of the damned can, like these animals, remain in the fire without being corrupted, as Augustine asserts,[^12] it would seem that they will suffer no distress there, which would not be the case unless their bodies were impassible. Therefore, etc.

Obj. 4. Further, If the bodies of the damned be passible, the pain resulting from their suffering, it seems, will surpass all present bodily pain, even as the joy of the saints will surpass all present joy. Now in this life it sometimes happens that the soul is severed from the body through excess of pain. Much more therefore if those bodies will be passible, the souls will be separate from the bodies through excess of pain, and thus those bodies will be corrupted, which is false. Therefore those bodies will be impassible.

On the contrary: It is written (1 Corinthians 15:52): "*And we shall be changed*": and a gloss says:[^15] "We,—the good alone,—will be changed with the unchangeableness and impassibility of glory."

Further: Even as the body co-operates with the soul in merit, so does it co-operate in sin. Now on account of the former co-operation not only the soul but also the body will be rewarded after the resurrection. Therefore in like manner the bodies of the damned will be punished, which would not be the case were they impassible. Therefore they will be passible.

I answer that: The principal cause of the bodies of the damned not being consumed by the fire will be the Divine justice by which their bodies will be consigned to everlasting punishment. Now the Divine justice is served also by the natural disposition, whether on the part of the passive body or on the part of the active causes; for since passiveness is a kind of receptiveness, there are two kinds of passion, corresponding to two ways in which one thing is receptive of another. For a form may be received into a subject materially according to its natural being, just as the air receives heat from fire materially; and corresponding to this manner

manner of reception there is a kind of passion which
we call passion of nature. In another way one
thing is received into another spiritually by way
of an intention, just as the likeness of whiteness
is received into the air and in the pupil; this
reception is like that whereby the soul receives
the likeness of things. Therefore corresponding
to this mode of reception is another mode of
passion which we call passion of the soul.

Since therefore after the resurrection and the
cessation of the heavenly movement it will be
impossible for a body to be altered by its natural
quality, as stated above (a. 2), it will not
be possible for any body to be passive with a
passion of nature. Consequently as regards this
mode of passion the bodies of the damned will
be impassible even as they will be incorruptible.
Yet after the heaven has ceased to move, there
will still remain the passion which is after the
manner of the soul, since the air will both receive
light from the sun, and will convey the
variety of colours to the sight. Therefore in
respect of this mode of passion the bodies of
the damned will be passible. But the glorified
bodies, although they receive something, and
are in a manner patient to sensation, will nevertheless
not be passive, since they will receive
nothing to distress or hurt them, as will the
bodies of the damned, which for this reason are
said to be passible.

Reply Obj. 1. The Philosopher is speaking of
the passion whereby the patient is changed from
its natural disposition. But this kind of passion
will not be in the bodies of the damned, as
stated above.

Reply Obj. 2. The likeness of the agent is in the
patient in two ways. First, in the same way as
in the agent, and thus it is in all univocal agents,
for instance a thing that is hot makes another
thing hot, and fire generates fire. Secondly,
otherwise than in the agent, and thus it is in all
equivocal agents. In these it happens sometimes
that a form which is in the agent spiritually
is received into the patient materially;
thus the form of the house built by the craftsman
is materially in itself, but spiritually in the
mind of the craftsman. On the other hand,
sometimes it is in the agent materially, but is
received into the patient spiritually; thus whiteness
is materially on the wall in which it is
received, while it is spiritually in the pupil and

# SUMMA THEOLOGICA

996

in the transferring medium. And so it is in the
case at issue, because the species which is in
the fire materially is received spiritually into
the bodies of the damned; thus it is that the
fire will assimilate the bodies of the damned to
itself, without, nevertheless, consuming them.

Reply Obj. 3. According to the Philosopher in
the treatise on the *Properties of the Elements*,¹
no animal can live in fire. Galen also (*De simplicium
medicamentorum ac facultatibus*)² says that there is no body which at
length is not consumed by fire, although sometimes
certain bodies may remain in fire without
hurt, such as ebony. The instance of the salamander
is not altogether apposite, since it cannot
remain in the fire without being at last

consumed, as do the bodies of the damned in
hell. Nor does it follow that because the bodies
of the damned suffer no corruption from the
fire, they therefore are not tormented by the
fire, because the sensible object has a natural
aptitude to please or displease the senses not
only as regards its natural action of stimulating
or injuring the organ, but also as regards its
spiritual action, since when the sensible object
is duly proportioned to the sense, it pleases,
while the contrary is the result when it is in
excess or defect. Hence subdued colours and
harmonious sounds are pleasing, whereas discordant
sounds displease the hearing.

Reply Obj. 4. Pain does not sever the soul
from the body according as it is confirmed to a
power of the soul which feels the pain, but according
as the passion of the soul leads to the
body being changed from its natural disposition.
Thus it is that we see that through anger
the body becomes heated, and through fear,
chilled; but after the resurrection it will be impossible
for the body to be changed from its
natural disposition, as stated above (a. 2). Consequently,
however great the pain will be, it
will not sever the body from the soul.

## TREATISE ON THE LAST THINGS

### QUESTION LXXXVII
Of the knowledge which, after rising
AGAIN, MEN WILL HAVE AT THE JUDGMENT
CONCERNING MERITS AND DEMERITS
(In Three Articles)

In the next place we must treat of those things
which follow the resurrection. The first of these
to be considered will be the knowledge, which
after rising again, men will have at the judgment,
concerning merits and demerits; the second
will be the general judgment itself, as also
the time and place at which it will be (q. lxxxviii);
thirdly we shall consider who will judge
and who will be judged (q. lxxxix); fourthly
we shall treat of the form wherein the judge
will come to judge (q. xc); and fifthly we shall
consider what will be after the judgment, the
state of the world and of those who will have
risen again (q. xci).

Under the first head there are three points of
inquiry:
1.  Whether at the judgment every man will know all his sins?
2.  Whether every one will be able to read all that is on another’s conscience?
3.  Whether one will be able at one glance to see all merits and demerits?

### Article 1. Whether After the Resurrection Every One Will Know What Sins He Has Committed?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It seems
that after the resurrection everyone will not be
able to know all the sins he has committed.

Objection 1. For whatever we know, either
we receive it newly through the senses, or we
draw it from the treasure house of the memory.
Now after the resurrection men will be unable
to perceive their sins by means of sense, because
they will be things of the past, while sense
perceives only the present; and many sins will
have escaped the sinner’s memory, and he will
be unable to recall them from the treasure
house of his memory. Therefore after rising
again one will not have knowledge of all the
sins one has committed.

Objection 2. Further, It is stated in the text (IV
*Sent.* d. 43)¹ that “there are certain books of
the conscience, in which each one’s merits are

¹ Lombard (*QR* II, 996).

inscribed.” Now one cannot read a thing in a
book, unless it be marked down in the book,
and sin leaves its mark upon the conscience according
to a gloss of Origen² on Rom. 2. 15, *Their
conscience bearing witness*, etc., which
mark, it seems, is nothing else than the guilt or
stain. Since then in many persons the guilt or
stain of many sins is blotted out by grace, it
would seem that one cannot read in one’s conscience
all the sins one has committed, and
thus the same conclusion follows as before.

² *Glossa Lombardi* (PL 191, 1346); Origen, *In Rom.* (PG 14, 894).

Objection 3. Further, The greater the cause the
greater the effect. Now the cause which makes
us grieve for the sins which we recall to memory
is charity. Since then charity is perfect in
the saints after the resurrection, they will grieve
exceedingly for their sins if they recall them to
memory; yet this is impossible, seeing that according
to Apoc. 21. 4, *Sorrow and mourning
shall flee away from them.*³ Therefore they will
not recall their own sins to memory.

³ The quotation is from Isa. 35.10. The text of the Apocalypse has: *Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more.*

Objection 4. Further, At the resurrection the damned
will be to the good they once did as the
blessed to the sins they once committed. Now
it seems that the damned after rising again will
have no knowledge of the good they once did,
since this would greatly alleviate their pain.
Neither therefore will the blessed have any
knowledge of the sins they had committed.

On the contrary, Augustine says⁴ that “a kind
of Divine energy will come to our aid, so that
we shall recall all our sins to mind.”

⁴ Augustine, *City of God*, xx, 14 (PL 41, 680).

Further, As human judgment is to outward
testimony, so is the Divine judgment to the
testimony of conscience, according to 1 Kings
16. 7, *Man seeth those things that appear, but
the Lord beholdeth the heart.* Now man cannot
pass a perfect judgment on a matter unless
evidence be taken on all the points that need
to be judged. Therefore, since the Divine judgment
is most perfect, it is necessary for the conscience
to witness to everything that has to be
judged. But all works, both good and evil, will
have to be judged (2 Cor. 5. 10): *We must all
be manifested before the judgment seat of

997

998 SUMMA THEOLOGICA

Christ, that every one may receive the proper
things of the body, according as he hath done,
whether it be good or evil.* Therefore each one’s
conscience must retain all the works he has
done, whether good or evil.

I answer that, According to Rom. 2. 15, 16,
*In the day when God shall judge* each one’s
conscience will bear witness to him, and his
thoughts will accuse and defend him. And since
in every judicial hearing, the witness, the accuser,
and the defendant need to be acquainted
with the matter on which judgment has to be
pronounced, and since at the general judgment
all the works of men will be submitted to judgment,
every man then will have to know all
his works. Therefore each man’s conscience
will be as a book containing his deeds on which
judgment will be pronounced, even as in the
human court of law we make use of records.
Of these books it is written in the Apocalypse
20. 12): *The books were opened: and another
book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged by those things which
were written in the books* (Vulg.,—book) *according
to their works.* According to Augustine’s
exposition,¹ the books which are here said
to be opened denote the saints of the New
and Old Testaments in whom God’s commandments
are exemplified.” Hence Richard of S.
Victor (*De judic. potest.*)² says: “Their hearts
will be like the code of law.” But the book of
life, of which the text goes on to speak, signifies
each one’s conscience, which is said to be one
single book, because the one Divine power will
cause all to recall their deeds, and this energy,
in so far as it reminds a man of his deeds, is
called the book of life.³ Or else we may refer
the first books to the conscience, and by the second
book we may understand the Judge’s sentence
as expressed in His providence.

¹ Augustine, *City of God*, xx, 14 (PL 41, 680).
² PL 196, 1182.
³ Cf. Part I, q. xxiv, a. 1, Reply 1; see Augustine, *City
of God*, xx, 14 (PL 41, 680).

Reply Obj. 1. Although many merits and demerits
will have escaped our memory, yet there
will be none of them but will remain somewhat
in its effect, because those merits which are not
deadened will remain in the reward accorded
to them, while those that are deadened remain
in the guilt of ingratitude, which is increased
through the fact that a man sinned after receiving
grace. In like manner those demerits
which are not blotted out by repentance remain
in the debt of punishment due to them, while
those which have been blotted out by repentance
remain in the remembrance of repentance,

which they will recall together with their other
merits. Hence in each man there will be something
whereby he will be able to recollect his
deeds. Nevertheless, as Augustine says,⁴ the
Divine energy will especially conduce to this.

⁴ *Loc. cit.*

Reply Obj. 2. Each one’s conscience will bear
certain marks of the deeds done by him; and it
does not follow that these marks are the guilt
alone, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 3. Although charity is now the
cause of sorrow for sin, yet the saints in heaven
will be so full of joy that they will have no room
for sorrow; and so they will not grieve for their
sins, but rather will they rejoice in the Divine
mercy, whereby their sins are forgiven them.
Even so do the angels rejoice now in the Divine
justice whereby those whom they guard fall
headlong into sin through being abandoned by
grace, and whose salvation none the less they
eagerly watch over.

Reply Obj. 4. The wicked will know all the
good they have done, and this will not diminish
their pain; indeed, it will increase it, because the
greatest sorrow is to have lost many goods, for
which reason Boethius says (*De Consolatione Philosophiae* ii, 4)⁵
that “the greatest misfortune is to have been
happy.”

⁵ PL 63, 677.

### Article 2. Whether Every One Will Be Able To Read All That Is In Another’s Conscience?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It
seems that it will be impossible for every one
to read all that is in another’s conscience.

Objection 1. For the knowledge of those who
rise again will not be clearer than that of the
angels, equality with whom is promised us after
the resurrection (Matt. 22. 30). Now angels
cannot read one another’s thoughts in matters
dependent on free choice, and so they need
to speak in order to notify such things to one
another. Therefore after rising again we shall
be unable to read what is contained in another’s
conscience.

Objection 2. Further, Whatever is known is known
either in itself, or in its cause, or in its effect.
Now the merits or demerits contained in a person’s
conscience cannot be known by another
in themselves, because God alone enters the
heart and reads its secrets. Neither will it be
possible for them to be known in their cause,
since all will not see God Who alone can act on
the will, from which merits and demerits proceed.
Nor again will it be possible to know
them from their effect, since there will be many
demerits, which through being wholly blotted

999

SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 87 ART. 3

out by repentance will leave no effect remaining.
Therefore it will not be possible for every
one to know all that is in another’s conscience.

Objection 3. Further, Chrysostom says (*Hom.
xxxi in Ep. ad Hebr.*),¹ as we have quoted before
(IV *Sent.* d. 17):² “If thou remember thy
sins now, and frequently confess them before
God and beg pardon for them, thou wilt very
soon blot them out; but if thou forget them,
thou wilt then remember them unwillingly,
when they will be made public, and declared
before all thy friends and foes, and in the presence
of the holy angels.” Hence it follows that
this publication will be the punishment of man’s
neglect in omitting to confess his sins. Therefore
the sins which a man has confessed will
not be made known to others.

¹ PG 63, 217.
² *QR* II, 855; cf. Gratian, *Decretum*, pt. II, causa 33, q. 3,
*De Poenit.*, dist. 1, append. ad Can. 87 (*RF* I, 1184).

Objection 4. Further, It is a relief to know that
one has had many associates in sin, so that one
is less ashamed of them. If therefore every
one were to know the sin of another, each
sinner’s shame would be much diminished,
which is unlikely. Therefore every one will
not know the sins of all.

On the contrary, A gloss on 1 Cor. 4. 5, *will
. . . bring to light the hidden things of darkness*,
says:³ “Deeds and thoughts both good and evil
will then be revealed and made known to all.”

³ *Glossa interl.* (VI, 38V); *Glossa Lombardi* (PL 191, 1566).

Further, The past sins of all the good will be
equally blotted out. Yet we know the sins of
some saints, for instance of Magdalen, Peter,
and David. Therefore in like manner the sins
of the other elect will be known, and much more
those of the damned.

I answer that, At the last and general judgment
the Divine justice, which now is in many
ways hidden, must appear evidently to all. Now
the sentence of one who condemns or rewards
cannot be just unless it be delivered according
to merits and demerits. Therefore just as both
judge and jury have to know the merits of a
case in order to deliver a just verdict, so is it
necessary, in order that the sentence appear to
be just, that all who know the sentence should
be acquainted with the merits. Hence, since
every one will know of his reward or condemnation,
so will every one else know of it, and consequently
as each one will recall his own merits
or demerits, so will he know those of others.

This is the more probable and more common
opinion, although the Master (IV *Sent.* d. 43)⁴
says the contrary, namely that a man’s sins

⁴ *QR* II, 998.

blotted out by repentance will not be made
known to others at the judgment. But it would
follow from this that neither would his repentance
for these sins be perfectly known, which
would detract considerably from the glory of
the saints and the praise due to God for having
so mercifully delivered them.

Reply Obj. 1. All the preceding merits or demerits
will come to a certain amount in the
glory or unhappiness of each one rising again.
Consequently through eternal things being seen
all things in their conscience will be visible,
especially as the Divine power will conduce to
this so that the Judge’s sentence may appear
just to all.

Reply Obj. 2. It will be possible for a man’s
merits or demerits to be made known by their
effects as stated above (Reply 1), or by the
power of God, although the power of the created
intellect is not sufficient for this.

Reply Obj. 3. The manifestation of his sins
to the confusion of the sinner is a result of his
neglect in omitting to confess them. But that
the sins of the saints be revealed cannot be to
their confusion or shame, as neither does it
bring confusion to Mary Magdalen that her sins
are publicly recalled in the Church, because
shame is “fear of disgrace,” as Damascene says
(*De Fide Orthod.* ii, 15),⁵ and this will be impossible
in the blessed. But this manifestation
will bring them great glory on account of the
penance they did, even as the confessor hails a
man who courageously confesses great crimes.
Sins are said to be blotted out because God does
not see them for the purpose of punishing them.

⁵ PG 94, 932; cf. Aristotle, *Ethics*, IV, 9 (1128b10).

Reply Obj. 4. The sinner’s confusion will
not be diminished, but on the contrary increased,
through his seeing the sins of others,
for in seeing that others are blameworthy he
will all the more acknowledge himself to be
blamed. For that confusion be diminished by
a cause of this kind is owing to the fact that
shame regards the esteem of men, who esteem
more lightly that which is customary. But then
confusion will regard the esteem of God, which
weighs every sin according to the truth, whether
it be the sin of one man or of many.

### Article 3. Whether All Merits and Demerits, One’s Own As Well As Those of Others, Will Be Seen By Anyone at a Single Glance?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It
would seem that not all merits and demerits,
one’s own as well as those of others, will be
seen by anyone at a single glance.

Objection 1. For things considered singly are
not seen at one glance. Now the damned will
consider their sins singly and will bewail them,
and therefore they say (Wisd. 5. 8): *What hath
pride profited us?* Therefore they will not see
them all at a glance.

Objection 2. Further, The Philosopher says¹ that
“we do not arrive at understanding several
things at the same time.” Now merits and demerits,
both our own and those of others, will
not be visible save to the intellect. Therefore
it will be impossible for them all to be seen at
the same time.

¹ Aristotle, *Topics*, II, 10 (114b34).

Objection 3. Further, The intellect of the damned
after the resurrection will not be clearer than
the intellect of the blessed and of the angels is
now, as to the natural knowledge by which they
know things by innate species. Now by such
knowledge the angels do not see several things
at the same time. Therefore neither will the
damned be able then to see all their deeds at
the same time.

On the contrary, A gloss on Job 8. 22, *They
shall be clothed with confusion*, says:² “As
soon as they shall see the Judge, all their evil
deeds will stand before their eyes.” Now they
will see the Judge suddenly. Therefore in like
manner will they see the evil they have done,
and for the same reason all others.

² *Glossa ordin.* (III, 23F); cf. Gregory the Great, *Moral.*, VIII, 53 (PL 75, 857).

Further, Augustine³ considers it unfitting
that at the judgment a material book should be
read containing the deeds of each individual
written in it, for the reason that it would be impossible
to measure the size of such a book,
or the time it would take to read. But in like
manner it would be impossible to estimate the
length of time one would require in order to
consider all one’s merits and demerits and those
of others if one saw these various things one
after the other. Therefore we must admit that
each one sees them all at the same time.

³ Augustine, *City of God*, xx, 14 (PL 41, 680).

I answer that, There are two opinions on this
question. For some say that one will see all
merits and demerits, both one’s own and those
of others, at the same time in an instant. This
is easily credible with regard to the blessed,
since they will see all things in the Word, and
consequently it is not unreasonable that they
should see several things at the same time. But
with regard to the damned, a difficulty presents
itself, since their intellect is not raised so that
they can see God and all else in Him. Therefore
others say that the wicked will see all

1001 SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 88 ART. 2

their sins and those of others generically at the
same time, and this suffices for the accusation
or absolution necessary for the judgment; but
that they will not see them all down to each
single one at the same time. But neither does
this seem consonant with the words of Augustine,⁴
who says that they will count them all
with one glance of the mind; and what is known
generically is not counted. Hence we may
choose a middle way, by holding that they will
consider each sin not instantaneously, but in
a very short time, the Divine power coming to
their aid. This agrees with the saying of Augustine⁵
that “they will be discerned with wondrous
rapidity.” Nor is this impossible, since
in a space of time, however short, there is potentially
an infinite number of instants. This
suffices for the replies to the objections on
either side of the question.

## QUESTION LXXXVIII
Of the general judgment, as to the
TIME AND PLACE AT WHICH IT WILL BE
(In Four Articles)

We must next consider the general judgment,
as to the time and place at which it will be.
Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
1.  Whether there will be a general judgment?
2.  Whether as regards the inquiry it will be conducted by word of mouth?
3.  Whether it will take place at an unknown time?
4.  Whether it will take place in the valley of Josaphat?

### Article 1. Whether There Will Be a General Judgment?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would
seem that there will not be a general judgment.

Objection 1. For according to Nahum 1. 9,
following the Septuagint version, God will not
judge the same thing a second time. But God
judges now of man’s every work, by assigning
punishments and rewards to each one after
death, and also by rewarding and punishing
certain ones in this life for their good or evil
deeds. Therefore it would seem that there will
be no other judgment.

Objection 2. Further, In no judicial inquiry is the
sentence carried out before judgment is pronounced.
But the sentence of the Divine judgment
on man regards the acquisition of the
kingdom or exclusion from the kingdom
(Matt. 25. 34, 41). Therefore since some obtain
possession of the kingdom now and some

are excluded from it for ever, it would seem
that there will be no other judgment.

Objection 3. Further, The reason why certain
things are submitted to judgment is that we
may come to a decision about them. Now before
the end of the world each of the damned
is awarded his damnation, and each of the
blessed his happiness. Therefore, etc.

On the contrary, It is written (Matt. 12. 41):
> The men of Nineve shall rise in judgment with
> this generation, and shall condemn it.

Therefore
there will be a judgment after the resurrection.

Further, It is written (John 5. 29):
> They
> that have done good things shall come forth
> unto the resurrection of life, but they that have
> done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.

Therefore it would seem that after the resurrection
there will be a judgment.

I answer that, Just as operation refers to the
beginning from which things receive their being,
so judgment belongs to the term, in which
they are brought to their end. Now we distinguish
a twofold operation in God. One is
that by which He first gave things their being,
by fashioning their nature and by establishing
the distinctions which contribute to their perfection;
from this work God is stated to have
rested (Gen. 2. 2). His other operation is that
by which He works in governing creatures, and
of this it is written (John 5. 17): *My Father
worketh until now; and I work.* Hence we distinguish
in Him a twofold judgment, but in the
reverse order. One corresponds to the work of
governance which cannot be without judgment,
and by this judgment each one is judged individually
according to his works, not only as
adapted to himself, but also as adapted to the
government of the universe. Hence one man’s
reward is delayed for the good of others (Heb.
11. 13, 39, 40), and the punishment of one conduces
to the profit of another. Consequently
it is necessary that there should be another,
and that a general judgment corresponding on
the other hand with the first formation of things
in being, in order that, namely, just as then
all things proceeded immediately from God, so
at length the world will receive its ultimate
completion, by each one receiving finally his
own personal due. Hence at this judgment the
Divine justice will be made manifest in all
things, whereas now it remains hidden, because
at times some persons are dealt with for the
profit of others otherwise than their manifest
works would seem to require. For this same
reason there will then be a general separation of
the good from the wicked, because there will be
no further motive for the good to profit by the
wicked, or the wicked by the good, for the sake

of which profit the good are meanwhile mingled with the wicked, so long as this state of life is governed by Divine providence.

Reply Obj. 1. Each man is both an individual person and a part of the whole human race, and so a twofold judgment is due to him. One, the particular judgment, is that to which he will be subjected after death, when he will receive according as he has done in the body, not indeed entirely but only in part, since he will receive not in the body but only in the soul. The other judgment will be passed on him as a part of the human race; thus a man is said to be judged according to human justice even when judgment is pronounced on the community of which he is a part. Hence at the general judgment of the whole human race by the general separation of the good from the wicked, it follows that each one will be judged. And yet God will not judge the same thing a second time, since He will not inflict two punishments for one sin, and the punishment which before the judgment was not inflicted completely will be completed at the last judgment, after which the wicked will be tormented at the same time in body and soul.

Reply Obj. 2. The sentence proper to this general judgment is the general separation of the good from the wicked, which will not precede this judgment. Yet even now, as regards the particular sentence on each individual, the judgment does not at once take full effect, since even the good will receive an increase of reward after the judgment, both from the added glory of the body and from the completion of the number of the saints. The wicked also will receive an increase of torment from the added punishment of the body and from the completion of the number of damned to be punished, because the more numerous those with whom they will burn, the more will they themselves burn.

Reply Obj. 3. The general judgment will regard more directly the generality of men than each individual to be judged, as stated above. Therefore although before that judgment each one will be certain of his condemnation or reward, he will not know of the condemnation or reward of everyone else. Hence the necessity of the general judgment.

## Article 2. Whether the Judgment Will Take Place by Word of Mouth?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that this judgment, as regards the inquiry and sentence, will take place by word of mouth.

Objection 1. For according to Augustine,1
> “it is uncertain how many days this judgment will last.”
But it would not be uncertain if the things we are told will take place at the judgment were to be accomplished only in the mind. Therefore this judgment will take place by word of mouth and not only in the mind.

Objection 2. Further, Gregory says (*Moralia*, xxvi, 29)2 and he is quoted in the text:3
> “Those at least will hear the words of the Judge, who have confessed their faith in Him by words.”
Now this cannot be understood as referring to the inner word, because thus all will hear the Judge’s words, since all the deeds of other men will be known to all, both good and wicked. Therefore it seems that this judgment will take place by word of mouth.

Objection 3. Further, Christ will judge according to His human form, so as to be visible in the body to all. Therefore in like manner it seems that He will speak with the voice of the body, so as to be heard by all.

On the contrary, Augustine says4 that the book of life which is mentioned Apoc. 20. 12, 15
> “is a kind of Divine energy enabling each one to remember all his good or evil works, and to discern them with the gaze of the mind, with wondrous rapidity, his knowledge accusing or defending his conscience, so that all and each will be judged at the same moment.”
But if each one’s merits were discussed by word of mouth, all and each could not be judged at the same moment. Therefore it would seem that this judgment will not take place by word of mouth.

Further, the sentence should correspond proportionately to the testimony. Now the testimony both of accusation and of defence will be mental, according to Rom. 2. 15, 16:
> Their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.
Therefore, it seems, this sentence and the entire judgment will take place mentally.

I answer that, It is not possible to come to any certain conclusion about the truth of this question. It is, however, the more probable opinion that the whole of this judgment, whether as regards the inquiry, or as regards the accusation of the wicked and the approval of the good, or again as regards the sentence on both, will take place mentally. For if the deeds of each individual were to be related by word of mouth, this would require an inconceivable length of time. Thus Augustine says5 that if we suppose the book, from the pages of which all will be judged according to Apoc. 20., to be:
> “a material book, who will be able to conceive its size and length? or the length of time required for the reading of a book that contains the entire life of every individual?”
Nor is less time required for telling by word of mouth the deeds of each individual than for reading them if they were written in a material book. Hence, probably we should understand that the details set forth in Matt. 25. will be fulfilled not by word of mouth but mentally.

Reply Obj. 1. The reason why Augustine says that it is uncertain how many days this judgment will last is precisely because it is not certain whether it will take place mentally or by word of mouth. For if it were to take place by word of mouth, a considerable time would be necessary; but if mentally, it is possible for it to be accomplished in an instant.

Reply Obj. 2. Even if the judgment is accomplished solely in the mind, the saying of Gregory stands, since though all will know their own and others’ deeds, as a result of the Divine energy which the Gospel describes as speech (Matt. 25. 34-46), nevertheless those who have had the faith which they received through God’s words will be judged from those very words, for it is written (Rom. 2. 12):
> Whosoever have sinned in the Law shall be judged by the Law.
Hence in a special way something will be said to those who had been believers which will not be said to unbelievers.

Reply Obj. 3. Christ will appear in body, so that the Judge may be recognized in the body by all, and it is possible for this to take place suddenly. But speech which is measured by time would require an immense length of time if the judgment took place by word of mouth.

## Article 3. Whether the Time of the Future Judgment Is Unknown?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the time of the future judgment is not unknown.

Objection 1. For just as the holy Fathers looked forward to the first coming, so do we look forward to the second. But the holy Fathers knew the time of the first coming, as proved by the number of weeks mentioned in Dan. 9; therefore the Jews are reproached for not knowing the time of Christ’s coming (Luke 12. 56):
> You hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the heaven and of the earth, but how is it that you do not discern this time?
Therefore it would seem that the time of the second coming when God will come to judgment should also be determinate to us.

Objection 2. Further, we arrive by means of signs at the knowledge of the things signified. Now many signs of the coming judgment are declared to us in Scripture (Matt. 24.; Mark 13.; Luke 21.). Therefore we can arrive at the knowledge of that time.

Objection 3. Further, the Apostle says (1 Cor. 10. 11):
> It is on us that the ends of the world are come,1
and (1 John 2. 18):
> Little children, it is the last hour, etc.
Since then it is a long time since these things were said, it would seem that now at least we can know that the last judgment is nigh.

Objection 4. Further, there is no need for the time of the judgment to be hidden, except that each one may be careful to prepare himself for judgment, being in ignorance of the appointed time. Yet the same care would still be necessary even were the time known for certain, because each one is uncertain about the time of his death, of which Augustine says (*Epistola ad Hesychium*, cxcix, 1)2 that:
> “as each one’s last day finds him, so will the world’s last day find him.”
Therefore there is no necessity for the time of the judgment to be uncertain.

On the contrary, it is written (Mark 13. 32):
> “Of that day or hour no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.”
The Son, however, is said not to know in so far as He does not impart the knowledge to us.

Further, it is written (1 Thess. 5. 2):
> “The day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.”
Therefore it seems, since the coming of a thief in the night is altogether uncertain, the day of the last judgment is altogether uncertain.

I answer that, God is the cause of things by His knowledge. Now He communicates both these things to His creatures, since He both endows some with the power of action on others, of which they are the cause, and bestows on some the knowledge of things. But in both cases He reserves something to Himself, for He operates certain things wherein no creature co-operates with Him, and again He knows certain things which are unknown to any mere creature. Now this should apply to none more than to those things which are subject to the Divine power alone, and in which no creature co-operates with Him. Such is the end of the world when the day of judgment will come. For the world will come to an end by no created cause, even as it derived its being immediately from God. Therefore the knowledge of the end of the world is fittingly reserved to God. Indeed our Lord seems to assign this very reason when He said (Acts 1. 7):
> “It is not for you to know the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power,”
as though He were to say, “which are reserved to His power alone.”

Reply Obj. 1. At His first coming Christ came secretly according to Isa. 45. 15:
> “Verily Thou art a hidden God, the God of Israel, the Saviour.”
Hence, that He might be recognized by believers, it was necessary for the time to be fixed beforehand with certainty. On the other hand, at the second coming, He will come openly, according to Ps. 49. 3:
> “God shall come manifestly.”
Consequently there can be no error about the knowledge of His coming. Hence the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 2. As Augustine says, in his letter to Hesychius concerning the day of judgment (*Epistola* cxcix, 9),3:
> “the signs mentioned in the Gospels do not all refer to the second advent which will happen at the end of the world, but some of them belong to the time of the sack of Jerusalem, which is now a thing of the past, while some, in fact many of them, refer to the advent whereby He comes daily to the Church, whom He visits spiritually when He dwells in us by faith and love.”
Moreover, the details mentioned in the Gospels and Epistles in connection with the last coming are not sufficient to enable us to determine the time of the judgment, for the trials that are foretold as announcing the proximity of Christ’s coming occurred even at the time of the Early Church, in a degree sometimes more, sometimes less marked, so that even the days of the apostles were called the last days (Acts 2. 17) when Peter expounded the saying of Joel 2. 28:
> “It shall come to pass in the last days, etc.,”
as referring to that time. Yet it was already a long time since then, and sometimes there were more and sometimes less afflictions in the Church. Consequently it is impossible to decide after how long a time it will take place, nor fix the month, year, century, or thousand years, as Augustine says in the same book (*loc. cit.*). And even if we are to believe that at the end these calamities will be more frequent, it is impossible to fix what amount of such calamities will immediately precede the judgment day or the coming of Antichrist, since even at the time of the Early Church persecutions were so bitter, and the corruptions of error were so numerous, that some looked forward to the coming of Antichrist as being near or imminent, as related in Eusebius’ *History of the Church* (vi, 7) and in Jerome’s book *De Viris Illustribus*.

Reply Obj. 3. The statement, “It is the last hour,” and similar expressions that are to be found in Scripture do not enable us to know the exact length of time. For they are not intended to indicate a short length of time, but to signify the last state of the world, which is the last age of all, and it is not stated definitely how long this will last. Thus neither is fixed duration appointed to old age, which is the last age of man, since sometimes it is seen to last as long as or even longer than all the previous ages, as Augustine remarks.3 Hence also the Apostle (2 Thess. 2. 2) disclaims the false meaning which some had given to his words, by believing that the day of the Lord was already at hand.

Reply Obj. 4. Notwithstanding the uncertainty of death, the uncertainty of the judgment conduces to watchfulness in two ways. First, as regards the thing that is not known, since its delay is equal to the length of man’s life, so that on either side uncertainty provokes him to greater care. Secondly, for the reason that a man is careful not only of his own person, but also of his family, or of his city or kingdom, or of the whole Church, the length of whose duration is not dependent on the length of man’s life. And yet each of these must be so ordered that the day of the Lord finds us not unprepared.

## Article 4. Whether the Judgment Will Take Place in the Valley of Josaphat?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the judgment will not take place in the valley of Josaphat or in the surrounding locality.

Objection 1. For at least it will be necessary for those to be judged to stand on the ground, and those alone to be raised aloft whose business it will be to judge. But the whole land of promise would not be able to contain the multitude of those who are to be judged. Therefore it is impossible for the judgment to take place in the neighbourhood of that valley.

Objection 2. Further, to Christ in His human form judgment is given that He may judge justly, since He was judged unjustly in the court of Pilate, and bore the sentence of an unjust judgment on Golgotha. Therefore these places would be more suitably appointed for the judgment.

Objection 3. Further, clouds result from the exhalation of vapours. But then there will be no evaporation or exhalation. Therefore it will be impossible for the just to be taken up in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and consequently it will be necessary for both good and wicked to be on the earth, so that a much larger place than this valley will be required.

On the contrary, it is written (Joel 3. 2):
> “I will gather together all nations and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat, and I will plead with them there.”

Further, it is written (Acts 1. 11):
> “This Jesus . . . shall so come as you have seen Him going into heaven.”
Now He ascended into heaven from Mount Olivet which overlooks the valley of Josaphat. Therefore He will come to judge in the neighbourhood of that place.

I answer that, we cannot know with any great certainty the manner in which this judgment will take place, nor how men will gather together to the place of judgment; but it may be gathered from Scripture that in all probability He will descend in the neighbourhood of Mount Olivet, even as He ascended from there, so as to show that He who descends is the same as He who ascended.

Reply Obj. 1. A great multitude can be enclosed in a small space. And all that is required is that in the neighbourhood of that locality there be a space, however great, to contain the multitude of those who are to be judged, provided that Christ can be seen from there, since being raised in the air, and shining with exceeding glory, He will be visible from a great distance.

Reply Obj. 2. Although through being sentenced unjustly Christ merited His judiciary power, He will not judge with the appearance of infirmity wherein He was judged unjustly, but under the appearance of glory wherein He ascended to the Father. Hence the place of His ascension is more suitable to the judgment than the place where He was condemned.

Reply Obj. 3. In the opinion of some, the name of clouds is here given to certain condensations of the light shining from the bodies of the saints, and not to evaporations from earth and water. Or we may say that those clouds will be produced by Divine power in order to show the parallel between His coming to judge and His ascension, so that He Who ascended in a cloud may come to judgment in a cloud.

Again, the cloud on account of its refreshing influence indicates the mercy of the Judge.

# QUESTION LXXXIX Of Those Who Will Judge and of Those Who Will Be Judged at the General Judgment

### (In Eight Articles)

We must next consider who will judge and who will be judged at the general judgment. Under this head there are eight points of inquiry:
- (1) Whether any men will judge together with Christ?
- (2) Whether the judicial power corresponds to voluntary poverty?
- (3) Whether the angels also will judge?
- (4) Whether the demons will carry out the Judge’s sentence on the damned?
- (5) Whether all men will come up for judgment?
- (6) Whether any of the good will be judged?
- (7) Whether any of the wicked will be judged?
- (8) Whether the angels also will be judged?

## Article 1. Whether Any Men Will Judge Together With Christ?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that no men will judge with Christ.

Objection 1. For it is written (John 5. 22, 23):
> “The Father . . . hath given all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son.”
Therefore, etc.

Objection 2. Further, whoever judges has authority over that which he judges. Now those things about which the coming judgment will have to be, such as human merits and demerits, are subject to Divine authority alone. Therefore no one is able to judge of those things.

Objection 3. Further, this judgment will take place not vocally but mentally. Now the publication of merits and demerits in the hearts of all men (which is like an accusation or approval), or the repayment of punishment and reward (which is like the pronouncement of the sentence) will be the work of God alone. Therefore none but Christ Who is God will judge.

On the contrary, it is written (Matt. 19. 28):
> “You also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
Therefore, etc.

Further,
> “The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of His people” (Isa. 3. 14).
Therefore it would seem that others also will judge together with Christ.

I answer that, “To judge” has several meanings. First, it is used causally as it were, when we say it of that which proves that some person ought to be judged. In this sense the expression is used of certain people in comparison, in so far as some are shown to be deserving of judgment through being compared with others; for instance (Matt. 12. 41):
> “The men of Nineve shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it.”
To rise in judgment thus is common to the good and the wicked.

Secondly, the expression “to judge” is used equivalently, so to say; for consent to an action is considered equivalent to doing it. Therefore those who will consent with Christ the Judge, by approving His sentence, will be said to judge. In this sense it will belong to all the elect to judge, and so it is written (Wisd. 3. 7, 8):
> “The just . . . shall judge nations.”

Thirdly, a person is said to judge as an assessor and by likeness, because he is like the judge in that his seat is raised above the others, and thus assessors are said to judge.1 Some say that the perfect to whom judiciary power is promised (Matt. 19. 28) will judge in this sense, namely that they will be raised to the dignity of assessors, because they will appear above others at the judgment, and go forth to meet Christ, into the air. But this apparently does not suffice for the fulfillment of our Lord’s promise (*ibid.*):
> “You shall sit . . . judging,”
for He would seem to make judging something additional to sitting.

Hence there is a fourth way of judging, which will belong to perfect men as containing the decrees of Divine justice according to which men will be judged; thus a book containing the law might be said to judge, and so it is written (Apoc. 20. 12):2
> “the court was seated, and the books were opened.”
Richard of St. Victor expounds this judging in this way (*De judiciaria potestate*),3 and therefore he says:
> “Those who persevere in Divine contemplation, who read every day the book of wisdom, transcribe, so to speak, in their hearts whatever they grasp by their clear insight of the truth”;
and further on:
> “What else are the hearts of those who judge, divinely instructed in all truth, but a codex of the law?”

Since, however, judging denotes an action exercised on another person, it follows that, properly speaking, he is said to judge who pronounces judgment on another. But this happens in two ways. First, by his own authority, and this belongs to the one who has dominion and power over others, and to whose ruling those who are judged are subject, and therefore it belongs to him to pass judgment on them. In this sense to judge belongs to God alone. Secondly, to judge is to acquaint others of the sentence delivered by another’s authority, that is, to announce the verdict already given. In this way perfect men will judge, because they will lead others to the knowledge of Divine justice, that these may know what is due to them on account of their merits, so that this very revelation of justice is called judgment. Hence Richard of St. Victor says (*loc. cit.*) that for:
> “the judges to open the books of their decree in the presence of those who are to be judged signifies that they open their hearts to the gaze of all those who are below them, and that they reveal their knowledge in whatever pertains to the judgment.”

Reply Obj. 1. This objection considers the judgment of authority which belongs to Christ alone, and the same answer applies to the Second Objection.

Reply Obj. 3. There is no reason why some of the saints should not reveal certain things to others, either by way of enlightenment, as the higher angels enlighten the lower, or by way of speech as the lower angels speak to the higher.

## Article 2. Whether the Judicial Power Corresponds to Voluntary Poverty?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the judicial power does not correspond to voluntary poverty.

Objection 1. For it was promised to none but the twelve apostles (Matt. 19. 28):
> “You shall sit on twelve seats, judging, etc.”
Since then those who are voluntarily poor are not all apostles, it would seem that the judicial power does not correspond to all.

Objection 2. Further, to offer sacrifice to God of one’s own body is more than to do so of outward things. Now martyrs and also virgins offer sacrifice to God of their own body, while the voluntarily poor offer sacrifice of outward things. Therefore the sublimity of the judicial power is more in keeping with martyrs and virgins than with those who are voluntarily poor.

Objection 3. Further, it is written (John 5. 45):
> “There is one that accuseth you, Moses in whom you trust,”
— “because you believe not his voice,” according to a gloss,1 and (ibid. 12. 48):
> “The word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day.”
Therefore the fact that a man propounds a law, or exhorts men by word to lead a good life, gives him the right to judge those who scorn his utterances. But this belongs to teachers. Therefore it is more competent to teachers than to those who are poor voluntarily.

Objection 4. Further, Christ through being judged unjustly merited as man to be judge of all in His human nature, according to John 5. 27:
> “He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man.”
Now those who suffer persecution for justice’s sake are judged unjustly. Therefore the judicial power belongs to them rather than to the voluntarily poor.

Objection 5. Further, a superior is not judged by his inferior. Now many who will have made lawful use of riches will have greater merit than many of the voluntarily poor. Therefore the voluntarily poor will not judge where those are to be judged.

On the contrary, it is written (Job 36. 6):
> “He saveth not the wicked, and He giveth judgment to the poor.”

Further, a gloss on Matt. 19. 28, “You who have left all things” (Vulg., “You who have followed Me.”) says:2
> “Those who left all things and followed God will be the judges; those who made right use of what they had lawfully will be judged,”
and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

I answer that, the judicial power is due especially to poverty on three counts. First, by reason of fitness, since voluntary poverty belongs to those who despise all the things of the world and cleave to Christ alone. Consequently there is nothing in them to turn away their judgment from justice, so that they are rendered able to be judges as loving the truth of justice above all things. Secondly, by reason of merit, since exaltation corresponds by way of merit to humility. Now of all the things that make man contemptible in this world, humility is the chief, and for this reason the excellence of judicial power is promised to the poor, so that he who humbles himself for Christ’s sake shall be exalted. Thirdly, because poverty disposes a man to the aforesaid manner of judging. For the reason why one of the saints will be said to judge, as stated above (a. 1), is that he will have the heart instructed in all Divine truth which he will be thus able to make known to others. Now in the advancement to perfection, the first thing that occurs to be renounced is external wealth, because this is the last thing of all to be acquired. And that which is last in the order of generation is the first in the order of destruction; therefore among the beatitudes whereby we advance to perfection, the first place is given to poverty. Thus judicial power corresponds to poverty, in so far as this is the first disposition to the aforesaid perfection.

Hence also it is that this same power is not promised to all who are voluntarily poor, but to those who leave all and follow Christ in accordance with the perfection of life.

Reply Obj. 1. According to Augustine,1 “we must not imagine that because He says that they will sit on twelve seats, only twelve men will judge with Him; otherwise since we read that Matthias was appointed apostle in the place of the traitor Judas, Paul who worked more than the rest will have nowhere to sit as judge.” Hence “the number twelve,” as he states,2 “signifies the whole multitude of those who will judge, because the two parts of seven, namely three and four, being multiplied together make twelve.” Moreover twelve is a perfect number, being the double of six, which is a perfect number.

Or, speaking literally, He spoke to the twelve apostles in whose person He made this promise to all who follow them.

Reply Obj. 2. Virginity and martyrdom do not dispose man to retain the precepts of Divine justice in his heart in the same degree as poverty does; just as also, on the other hand, outward riches choke the word of God by the cares which they entail (Luke 8. 14). Or we may reply that poverty does not suffice alone to merit judicial power, but is the fundamental part of that perfection to which the judicial power corresponds. Therefore among those things regarding perfection which follow after poverty we may reckon both virginity and martyrdom and all the works of perfection; yet they do not rank as high as poverty, since the beginning of a thing is its chief part.

Reply Obj. 3. He who propounded the law or urged men to good will judge, in the causal sense, because others will be judged in reference to the words he has uttered or propounded. Hence the judicial power does not properly correspond to preaching or teaching. Or we may reply that, as some say, three things are required for the judicial power: first that one renounce temporal cares, lest the mind be hindered from the contemplation of wisdom; secondly that one possess Divine justice by way of habit both as to knowledge and as to observance; thirdly that one should have taught others this same justice; and this teaching will be the perfection whereby a man merits to have judicial power.

Reply Obj. 4. Christ humbled Himself in that He was judged unjustly, for He was offered because it was His own will (Isa. 53. 7); and by His humility He merited His exaltation to judicial power, since all things are made subject to Him (Philip. 2. 8, 9). Hence, judicial power is more due to them who humble themselves of their own will by renouncing temporal goods, on account of which men are honoured by worldlings, than to those who are humbled by others.

Reply Obj. 5. An inferior cannot judge a superior by his own authority, but he can do so by the authority of a superior, as in the case of a judge-delegate. Hence it is not unfitting that it be granted to the poor as an accidental reward to judge others, even those who have higher merit in respect of the essential reward.

### Article 3. Whether the Angels Will Judge?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the angels will judge.

Objection 1. For it is written (Matt. 25. 31):
> When the Son of man shall come in His majesty, and all the angels with Him.

Now He is speaking of His coming to judgment. Therefore it would seem that also the angels will judge.

Obj. 2. Further, The orders of the angels take their names from the offices which they fulfil. Now one of the angelic orders is that of the Thrones, which would seem to pertain to the judicial power, since a throne is the judicial bench, a royal seat, a professor’s chair. Therefore some of the angels will judge.

Obj. 3. Further, Equality with the angels is promised the saints after this life (Matt. 22. 30). If then men will have this power of judging, much more will the angels have it.

On the contrary, It is written (John 5. 27):
> He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man.

But the angels have not the human nature in common with Him. Neither therefore do they share with Him in the judicial power.

Further, The same person is not judge and judge’s minister. Now in this judgment the angels will act as ministers of the Judge and, according to Matt. 13. 41:
> The Son of man shall send His angels and they shall gather out of His kingdom all scandals.

Therefore the angels will not judge.

I answer that, The judge’s assessors must be conformed to the judge. Now judgment is ascribed to the Son of man because He will appear to all, both good and wicked, in His human nature, although the whole Trinity will judge by authority. Consequently it is necessary also for the judge’s assessors to have the human nature, so as to be visible to all, both good and wicked. Hence it is not fitting for the angels to judge, although in a certain sense we may say that the angels will judge, namely by approving the sentence.

Reply Obj. 1. As a gloss on this passage observes,3 the angels will come with Christ, not to judge, but “as witnesses of men’s deeds, because it was under their guardianship that men did well or ill.”

Reply Obj. 2. The name of Thrones is given to angels in reference to the judgment which God is ever pronouncing, by governing all things with supreme justice, of which judgment angels are in a way the executors and promulgators. On the other hand, the judgment of men by the man Christ will require human assessors.

Reply Obj. 3. Equality with angels is promised to men as regards the essential reward. But nothing hinders an accidental reward from being bestowed on men to the exclusion of the angels, as in the case of the virgins’ and martyrs’ crowns; and the same may be said of the judicial power.

### Article 4. Whether the Demons Will Carry Out the Sentence of the Judge on the Damned?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the demons will not carry out the sentence of the Judge on the damned after the day of judgment.

Objection 1. For, according to the Apostle (I Cor. 15. 24):
> He will then bring to nought all principality, and power, and virtue (Vulg.,—When He shall have brought to nought, etc.).

Therefore all supremacy will cease then. But the carrying out of the Judge’s sentence implies some kind of supremacy. Therefore after the judgment day the demons will not carry out the Judge’s sentence.

Obj. 2. Further, The demons sinned more grievously than men. Therefore it is not just that men should be tortured by demons.

Obj. 3. Further, Just as the demons suggest evil things to men, so good angels suggest good things. Now it will not be the duty of the good angels to reward the good, but this will be done by God, immediately by Himself. Therefore neither will it be the duty of the demons to punish the wicked.

On the contrary, Sinners have subjected themselves to the devil by sinning. Therefore it is just that they should be subjected to him in their punishments, and punished by him as it were.

I answer that, The Master in the text of *Sentences*, IV, d. 474 mentions two opinions on this question, both of which seem consistent with Divine justice, because it is just for man to be subjected to the devil for having sinned, and yet it is unjust for the demon to be over him. Accordingly the opinion which holds that after the judgment day the demons will not be placed over men to punish them, regards the order of Divine justice on the part of the demons punishing; while the contrary opinion regards the order of Divine justice on the part of the men punished.

Which of these opinions is nearer the truth we cannot know for certain. Yet I think it truer to say that just as, among the saved, order will be observed so that some will be enlightened and perfected by others (because all the orders of the heavenly hierarchies will continue for ever), so, too, will order be observed in punishments, men being punished by demons, lest the Divine order, whereby the angels are placed between the human nature and the Divine, be entirely set aside. Therefore just as the Divine illuminations are conveyed to men by the good angels, so too the demons execute the Divine justice on the wicked. Nor does this in any way diminish the punishment of the demons, since even in torturing others they are themselves tortured, because then the fellowship of the unhappy will not lessen but will increase unhappiness.

Reply Obj. 1. The supremacy which, it is declared, will be brought to nought by Christ in the time to come must be taken in the sense of the supremacy which is in keeping with the state of this world, wherein men are placed over men, angels over men, angels over angels, demons over demons, and demons over men; in every case so as either to lead towards the end or to lead astray from the end. But then, when all things will have attained to that end, there will be no supremacy to lead astray from the end or to lead to it, but only that which maintains in the end, good or evil.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the demerit of the demons does not require that they be placed over men, since they made men subject to them unjustly, yet this is required by the order of their nature in relation to human nature, since “natural goods remain in them unimpaired” as Dionysius says (*Div. Nom.* iv).5

Reply Obj. 3. The good angels are not the cause of the principal reward in the elect, because all receive this immediately from God. Nevertheless the angels are the cause of certain accidental rewards in men, in so far as the higher angels enlighten those beneath them, both angels and men, concerning certain hidden things of God, which do not belong to the essence of Happiness. In like manner the damned will receive their principal punishment immediately from God, namely the everlasting banishment from the Divine vision; but there is no reason why the demons should not torture men with other sensible punishments. There is, however, this difference, that merit exalts, whereas sin debases. Therefore since the angelic nature is higher than the human, some on account of the excellence of their merit will be so far exalted as to be raised above the angels both in nature and reward, so that some angels will be enlightened by some men. On the other hand, no human sinners will, on account of a certain degree of virtue, attain to the eminence that attaches to the nature of the demons.

### Article 5. Whether All Men Will Be Present at the Judgment?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that men will not all be present at the judgment.

Objection 1. For it is written (Matt. 19. 28):
> You . . . shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

But all men do not belong to those twelve tribes. Therefore it would seem that men will not all be present at the judgment.

Obj. 2. Further, The same apparently is to be gathered from Ps. 1. 5:
> The wicked shall not rise again in judgment.

Obj. 3. Further, A man is brought to judgment that his merits may be discussed. But some there are who have acquired no merits, such as children who died before reaching the perfect age. Therefore they need not be present at the judgment. Now there are many such. Therefore it would seem that men will not all be present at the judgment.

On the contrary, It is written (Acts 10. 42) that Christ was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead. Now this division comprises all men, no matter how the living be distinct from the dead. Therefore all men will be present at the judgment.

Further, It is written (Apoc. 1. 7):
> Behold He cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him.

Now this would not be so unless all were present at the judgment. Therefore, etc.

I answer that, The judicial power was bestowed on Christ as man, in reward for the humility which He showed forth in His passion. Now in His passion He shed His blood for all in point of sufficiency, although through meeting with an obstacle in some, it did not have its effect in all. Therefore it is fitting that all men should assemble at the judgment, to see His exaltation in His human nature, in respect of which He was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead (Acts 10. 42).

Reply Obj. 1. As Augustine says,6 “It does not follow from the saying, ‘Judging the twelve tribes of Israel,’ that the tribe of Levi, which is the thirteenth, is not to be judged, or that they will judge that people alone, and not other nations.” The reason why all other nations are denoted by the twelve tribes is because they were called by Christ to take the place of the twelve tribes.

Reply Obj. 2. The words, *The wicked shall not rise in judgment*, if referred to all sinners, mean that they will not arise to judge. But if the wicked denote unbelievers, the sense is that they will not rise to be judged because they are already judged (John 3. 18). All, however, will rise again to assemble at the judgment and witness the glory of the Judge.

Reply Obj. 3. Even children who have died before reaching the perfect age will be present at the judgment, not to be judged, but to see the Judge’s glory.

### Article 6. Whether the Good Will Be Judged at the Judgment?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that none of the good will be judged at the judgment.

Objection 1. For it is declared (John 3. 18) that
> he that believeth in Him is not judged.

Now all the good believed in Him. Therefore they will not be judged.

Obj. 2. Further, Those who are uncertain of their bliss are not blessed; hence Augustine proves (*De Genesi ad Litteram*, xi, 17)7 that the demons were never blessed. But the saints are now blessed. Therefore they are certain of their Happiness. Now what is certain is not submitted to judgment. Therefore the good will not be judged.

Obj. 3. Further, Fear is incompatible with Happiness. But the last judgment, which above all is described as terrible, cannot take place without inspiring fear into those who are to be judged. Hence Gregory observes on Job 41. 16:
> When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, etc.

(*Moralia in Iob*, xxxiv, 7)8: “Consider how the conscience of the wicked will then be troubled, when even the just are disturbed about their life.” Therefore the blessed will not be judged.

On the contrary, It would seem that all the good will be judged, since it is written (II Cor. 5. 10):
> We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper thing of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.

Now there is nothing else to be judged. Therefore all, even the good, will be judged.

Further, The “general” includes all. Now this is called the general judgment. Therefore all will be judged.

I answer that, The judgment comprises two things, namely the discussion of merits and the payment of rewards. As regards the payment of rewards, all will be judged, even the good, since the Divine sentence will appoint to each one the reward corresponding to his merit. But there is no discussion of merits save where good and evil merits are mingled together. Now those who build on the foundation of faith, gold, silver, and precious stones (I Cor. 3. 12), by devoting themselves wholly to the Divine service, and who have no marked admixture of evil merit, are not subjected to a discussion of their merits. Such are those who have entirely renounced the things of the world and are solicitously thoughtful of the things that are of God; therefore they will be saved but will not be judged. Others, however, build on the foundation of faith, wood, hay, stubble; they, in fact, love worldly things and are as busy about earthly concerns, yet so as to prefer nothing to Christ, but strive to redeem their sins with alms, and these have an admixture of good with evil merits. Hence they are subjected to a discussion of their merits, and consequently on this account will be judged, and yet they will be saved.

Reply Obj. 1. Since punishment is the effect of justice, while reward is the effect of mercy, it follows that punishment is more especially ascribed antonomastically to judgment which is the act of justice, so that judgment is sometimes used to express condemnation. It is thus that we are to understand the words quoted, as a gloss on the passage remarks.9

Reply Obj. 2. The merits of the elect will be discussed, not to remove the uncertainty of their Happiness from the hearts of those who are to be judged, but that it may be made manifest to us that their good merits outweigh their evil merits, and thus God’s justice be proved.

Reply Obj. 3. Gregory is speaking of the just who will still be in mortal flesh, and so he had already said: “Those who will still be in the body, although already brave and perfect, yet through being still in the flesh must be troubled with fear in the midst of such a whirlwind of terror.” Hence it is clear that this fear refers to the time immediately before the judgment, most terrible indeed to the wicked, but not to the good, who will have no apprehension of evil.

The arguments in the contrary sense consider judgment as regards the payment of rewards.

### Article 7. Whether the Wicked Will Be Judged?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that none of the wicked will be judged.

Objection 1. For even as damnation is certain in the case of unbelievers, so is it in the case of those who die in mortal sin. Now it is declared because of the certainty of damnation (John 3. 18):
> He that believeth not is already judged.

Therefore in like manner neither will other sinners be judged.

Obj. 2. Further, The voice of the Judge is most terrible to those who are condemned by His judgment. Now according to the text of *Sentences*, IV, d. 4710 and in the words of Gregory (*Moralia in Iob*, xxvi, 27)11 “the Judge will not address Himself to unbelievers.” If therefore He were to address Himself to the believers about to be condemned, the unbelievers would reap a benefit from their unbelief, which is absurd.

On the contrary, It would seem that all the wicked are to be judged, because all the wicked will be sentenced to punishment according to the degree of their guilt. But this cannot be done without a judicial pronouncement. Therefore all the wicked will be judged.

I answer that, The judgment as regards the sentencing to punishment for sin concerns all the wicked, while the judgment as regards the discussion of merits concerns only believers. Because in unbelievers the foundation of faith is lacking, without which all subsequent works are deprived of the perfection of a right intention, so that in them there is no admixture of good and evil works or merits requiring discussion. But believers in whom the foundation of faith remains have at least a praiseworthy act of faith, which though it is not meritorious without charity, yet is in itself directed to merit, and consequently they will be subjected to the discussion of merits. And so, believers who were at least counted as citizens of the *City of God* will be judged as citizens, and sentence of death will not be passed on them without a discussion of their merits; but unbelievers will be condemned as foes, who usually among men, are exterminated without their merits being discussed.

Reply Obj. 1. Although it is certain that those who die in mortal sin will be damned, nevertheless since they have an admixture of certain things connected with meriting well, it is necessary for the manifestation of Divine justice, that their merits be subjected to discussion, in order to make it clear that they are justly banished from the city of the saints, of which they appeared outwardly to be citizens.

Reply Obj. 2. Considered under this special aspect the words addressed to the believers about to be condemned will not be terrible, because they will reveal in them certain things pleasing to them, which it will be impossible to find in unbelievers, since without faith it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11. 6). But the sentence of condemnation which will be passed on them all will be terrible to all of them.

The argument in the contrary sense considered the judgment of retribution.

### Article 8. Whether at the Coming Judgment the Angels Will Be Judged?

We proceed thus to the Eighth Article: It would seem that the angels will be judged at the coming judgment.

Objection 1. For it is written (I Cor. 6. 3):
> Know you not that we shall judge angels?

But this cannot refer to the state of the present time. Therefore it should refer to the judgment to come.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written concerning Behemoth or Leviathan, whereby the devil is signified (Job 40. 28):
> In the sight of all he shall be cast down;

and (Matt. 8. 29)12 the demon cried out to Christ:
> Why art Thou come to torment us before the time?

for, according to a gloss,13 “the demons seeing our Lord on earth thought they were to be judged immediately.” Therefore it would seem that a final judgment is in store for them.

Obj. 3. Further, It is written (II Pet. 2. 4):
> God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment.

Therefore it seems that the angels will be judged.

On the contrary, It is written (Nahum 1. 9) according to the Septuagint version:
> God will not judge the same thing a second time.

But the wicked angels are already judged, and therefore it is written (John 16. 11):
> The prince of this world is already judged.

Therefore the angels will not be judged in the time to come.

Further, Goodness and wickedness are more perfect in the angels than in men who are wayfarers. Now some men, good and wicked, will not be judged. Therefore neither will good or wicked angels be judged.

I answer that, The judgment of discussion in no way concerns either the good or the wicked angels, since neither is any evil to be found in the good angels, nor is any good liable to judgment to be found in the wicked angels. But if we speak of the judgment of retribution, we must distinguish a twofold retribution. One corresponds to the angels’ personal merits and was made to both from the beginning, when some were raised to happiness, and others plunged into the depths of woe. The other corresponds to the merits, good or evil, procured through the angels, and this retribution will be made in the judgment to come, because the good angels will have an increased joy in the salvation of those whom they have prompted to deeds of merit, while the wicked will have an increase of torment through the manifold downfall of those whom they have incited to evil deeds. Consequently the judgment will not regard the angels directly, neither as judging nor as judged, but only men; but it will regard the angels indirectly somewhat, in so far as they were concerned in men’s deeds.

Reply Obj. 1. This saying of the Apostle refers to the judgment of comparison, because certain men will be found to be placed higher than the angels.

Reply Obj. 2. The demons will then be cast down in the sight of all because they will be imprisoned for ever in the dungeon of hell, so that they will no more be free to go out, since this was permitted to them only in so far as they were directed by Divine providence to try the life of man.

The same answer applies to the Third Objection.

## QUESTION XC
### Of the form of the judge in coming to the judgment
(In Three Articles)

We must now consider the form of the Judge in coming to the judgment. Under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether Christ will judge under the form of His humanity? (2) Whether He will appear under the form of His glorified humanity? (3) Whether His Godhead can be seen without joy?

### Article 1. Whether Christ Will Judge Under the Form of His Humanity?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that Christ will not judge under the form of His humanity.

Objection 1. For judgment requires authority in the judge. Now Christ has authority over the quick and the dead as God, for thus is He the Lord and Creator of all. Therefore He will judge under the form of His Godhead.

Obj. 2. Further, Invincible power is requisite in a judge; therefore it is written (Eccles. 7. 6):
> Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities.

Now invincible power belongs to Christ as God. Therefore He will judge under the form of the Godhead.

Obj. 3. Further, It is written (John 5. 22, 23):
> The Father . . . hath given all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father.

Now equal honour to that of the Father is not due to the Son in respect of His human nature. Therefore He will not judge under His human form.

Obj. 4. Further, It is written (Dan. 7. 9):
> I beheld till thrones were placed and the Ancient of days sat.

Now the thrones signify judicial power, and God is called the Ancient by reason of His eternity, according to Dionysius (*Div. Nom.* x).14 Therefore it becomes the Son to judge as being eternal; and consequently not as man.

Obj. 5. Further, Augustine says (*In Ioannis Evangelium Tractatus*, xix)15: “that the resurrection of the soul is the work of the Word the Son of God, and the resurrection of the body is the work of the Word made the Son of man in the flesh.” Now that last judgment regards the soul rather than the body. Therefore it becomes Christ to judge as God rather than as man.

On the contrary, It is written (John 5. 27):
> He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man.

Further, It is written (Job 36. 17):
> Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked,

— “by Pilate” according to a gloss —
> therefore, cause and judgment thou shalt recover,

— “that thou mayest judge justly,” according to the gloss.16 Now Christ was judged by Pilate with regard to His human nature. Therefore He will judge under the human nature.

Further, To Him it belongs to judge who made the law. Now Christ gave us the law of the Gospel while appearing in the human nature. Therefore He will judge under that same nature.

I answer that, Judgment requires a certain authority in the judge. Therefore it is written (Rom. 14. 4):
> Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant?

Hence it is becoming that Christ should judge in respect of His having

# SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 90 ART. 2

ing authority over men, to whom chiefly the last judgment will be directed. Now He is our Lord not only by reason of the Creation, since *the Lord He is God, He made us and not we ourselves* (Ps. 99:3), but also by reason of the Redemption, which pertains to Him in respect of His human nature. Therefore to this end *Christ died and rose again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living* (Rom. 14:9). But the goods of the Creation would not suffice us to obtain the reward of eternal life without the addition of the benefit of the Redemption, on account of the obstacle accruing to created nature through the sin of our first parent. Hence, since the last judgment is directed to the admission of some to the kingdom, and the exclusion of others from it, it is becoming that Christ should preside at that judgment under the form of His human nature, since it is by favor of that same nature’s Redemption that man is admitted to the kingdom. In this sense it is stated (Acts 10:42) that *He . . . was appointed by God to be Judge of the living and of the dead*. And because by redeeming mankind He restored not only man but all creatures without exception,—since all creatures are bettered through man’s restoration, according to Coloss. 1:20, *Making peace through the blood of His cross, both as to things on earth, and the things that are in heaven*,—it follows that through His Passion Christ merited lordship and judicial power not over man alone, but over all creatures, according to Matt. 28:18, *All power is given to Me, in heaven and in earth*.

Reply Obj. 1. Christ, in respect of His Divine nature, has authority of lordship over all creatures by right of creation; but in respect of His human nature He has authority of lordship merited through His Passion. The latter is secondary so to speak and acquired, while the former is natural and eternal.

Reply Obj. 2. Although Christ as man has not of Himself invincible power resulting from the natural power of the human species, nevertheless there is also in His human nature an invincible power derived from His Godhead, whereby *all things are subjected under His feet* (1 Cor. 15:25-28; Heb. 2:8, 9). Hence He will judge in His human nature indeed, but by the power of His Godhead.

Reply Obj. 3. Christ would not have sufficed for the redemption of mankind had He been a mere man. Therefore from the very fact that He was able as man to redeem mankind, and thereby obtained judicial power, it is evident that He is God, and consequently is to be honored equally with the Father, not as man but as God.

Reply Obj. 4. In that vision of Daniel the whole order of the judicial power is clearly expressed. This power is in God Himself as its first origin, and more especially in the Father Who is the fount of the entire Godhead; therefore it is stated in the first place that *the Ancient of days sat*. But the judicial power was transmitted from the Father to the Son, not only from eternity in respect of the Divine nature, but also in time in respect of the human nature wherein He merited it. Hence in this vision it is further stated (verses 13, 14): *Lo, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of days. . . . And He gave Him power and glory, and a kingdom*.

Reply Obj. 5. Augustine is speaking by a kind of appropriation, so as to trace the effects which Christ wrought in the human nature to causes somewhat similar to them. And since we are made to the image and likeness of God in respect of our soul, and are of the same species as the man Christ in respect of our body, he ascribes to the Godhead the effects wrought by Christ in our souls, and those which He wrought or will work in our bodies he ascribes to His flesh; although His flesh, as being the instrument of His Godhead, has also its effect on our souls as Damascene asserts (*De Fide Orthod.* iii, 15),^1 according to the saying of Heb. 9:14, that *His blood hath cleansed our conscience from dead works*. And thus that *the Word was made flesh* is the cause of the resurrection of souls; and therefore also according to His human nature He is fittingly the Judge not only of bodily but also of spiritual goods.

## Article 2. Whether at the Judgment Christ Will Appear in His Glorified Humanity?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that at the judgment Christ will not appear in his glorified humanity.

Objection 1. For a gloss on John 19:37, *They shall look on him whom they pierced*, says:^2 "Because He will come in the flesh wherein He was crucified." Now He was crucified in the form of weakness. Therefore He will appear in the form of weakness and not in the form of glory.

Obj. 2. Further, It is stated (Matt. 24:30) that *the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven*, namely, "the sign of the cross," as Chrysostom says (*Hom. lxxvi in Matt.*),^3 for "Christ when coming to the judgment will show not only the scars of His wounds but even His most shameful death." Therefore it seems that He will not appear in the form of glory.

Obj. 3. Further, Christ will appear at the judgment under that form which can be gazed upon by all. Now Christ will not be visible to all, good and wicked, under the form of His glorified humanity, because the eye that is not glorified does not seem to be proportioned to see the clarity of a glorified body. Therefore He will not appear under a glorified form.

Obj. 4. Further, That which is promised as a reward to the just is not granted to the unjust. Now it is promised as a reward to the just that they shall see the glory of His humanity (John 10:9): *He shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures*, that is "refreshment in His Godhead and humanity," according to the commentary of Augustine,^4 and Isa. 33:17: *His eyes shall see the King in his beauty*. Therefore He will not appear to all in His glorified form.

Obj. 5. Further, Christ will judge in the form in which He was judged; hence a gloss on John 5:21, *So the Son also giveth life to whom He will*, says:^5 "He will judge justly in the form wherein He was judged unjustly, that He may be visible to the wicked." Now He was judged in the form of weakness. Therefore He will appear in the same form at the judgment.

On the contrary, It is written (Luke 21:27): *Then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty*. Now majesty and power pertain to glory. Therefore He will appear in the form of glory.

Further, He who judges should be more conspicuous than those who are judged. Now the elect who will be judged by Christ will have a glorified body. Much more therefore will the Judge appear in a glorified form.

Further, As to be judged pertains to weakness, so as to judge pertains to authority and glory. Now at His first coming when Christ came to be judged, He appeared in the form of weakness. Therefore at the second coming, when He will come to judge, He will appear in the form of glory.

I answer that, Christ is called the mediator of God and men (1 Tim. 2:5) because He satisfies for men and intercedes for them to the Father, and confers on men things which belong to the Father, according to John 17:22, *The glory which Thou hast given Me, I have given to them*. Accordingly then both these things belong to Him in that He communicates with both extremes, for in that He communicates with men, He takes their part with the Father, and in that He communicates with the Father, He bestows the Father’s gifts on men. Since then at His first coming He came in order to make satisfaction for us to the Father, He came in the form of our weakness. But since at His second coming He will come in order to execute the Father’s justice on men, He will have to show forth His glory which is in Him by reason of His communication with the Father. And therefore He will appear in the form of glory.

Reply Obj. 1. He will appear in the same flesh, but not under the same form.

Reply Obj. 2. The sign of the cross will appear at the judgment, to denote not a present but a past weakness, so as to show how justly those were condemned who scorned so great mercy, especially those who persecuted Christ unjustly. The scars which will appear in His body will not be due to weakness, but will indicate the exceeding power whereby Christ overcame His enemies by His Passion and infirmity. He will also show forth His most shameful death, not by bringing it sensibly before the eye, as though He suffered it there, but by the things which will appear then, namely the signs of His past Passion, He will recall men to the thought of His past death.

Reply Obj. 3. A glorified body has it in its power to show itself or not to show itself to an eye that is not glorified, as stated above (q. lxxxv, a. 2, Reply 3). Hence Christ will be visible to all in His glorified form.

Reply Obj. 4. Even as our friend’s glory gives us pleasure, so the glory and power of one we hate is most displeasing to us. Hence as the sight of the glory of Christ’s humanity will be a reward to the just, so will it be a torment to Christ’s enemies; therefore it is written (Isa. 26:11): *Let the envious people see and be confounded and let fire (that is, envy)^6 devour Thy enemies*.

Reply Obj. 5. Form is taken there for human nature wherein He was judged and likewise will judge; but not for a quality of nature, namely of weakness, which will not be the same in Him when judging as when judged.

## Article 3. Whether the Godhead Can Be Seen by the Wicked Without Joy?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the Godhead can be seen by the wicked without joy.

Objection 1. For there can be no doubt that the wicked will know with the greatest certainty that Christ is God. Therefore they will see His Godhead, and yet they will not rejoice in seeing Christ. Therefore it will be possible to see it without joy.

Obj. 2. Further, The perverse will of the wicked is not more adverse to Christ’s humanity than to His Godhead. Now the fact that they will see the glory of His humanity will conduce to their punishment, as stated above (a. 2, Reply 4). Therefore if they were to see His Godhead, there would be much more reason for them to grieve rather than rejoice.

Obj. 3. Further, The course of the affections is not a necessary sequel to that which is in the intellect; hence Augustine says^7 "The intellect precedes, the affections follow slowly or not at all." Now vision regards the intellect, while joy regards the affections. Therefore it will be possible to see the Godhead without joy.

Obj. 4. Further, Whatever is received into a thing is received according to the mode of the receiver and not of the received. But whatever is seen is, in a way, received into the seer. Therefore although the Godhead is in itself supremely enjoyable, nevertheless when seen by those who are plunged in grief, it will give no joy but rather displeasure.

Obj. 5. Further, As sense is to the sensible thing, so is the intellect to the intelligible thing. Now in the senses, "to the unhealthy palate bread is painful, to the healthy palate sweet," as Augustine says,^8 and the same happens with the other senses. Therefore since the damned have the intellect indisposed, it would seem that the vision of the uncreated light will give them pain rather than joy.

On the contrary, It is written (John 17:3): *This is eternal life: That they may know Thee, the . . . true God*. Therefore it is clear that the essence of Happiness consists in seeing God. Now joy is essential to Happiness. Therefore the Godhead cannot be seen without joy.

Further, The essence of the Godhead is the essence of truth. Now it is delightful to every one to see the truth, and therefore "all naturally desire to know," as stated at the beginning of the *Metaphysics*.^9 Therefore it is impossible to see the Godhead without joy.

Further, If a certain vision is not always delightful, it happens sometimes to be painful. But intellectual vision is never painful since "the pleasure we take in understanding has no grief opposed to it," according to the Philosopher.^10 Since then the Godhead cannot be seen save by the intellect, it seems that the Godhead cannot be seen without joy.

I answer that, In every object of appetite or of pleasure two things may be considered, namely the thing which is desired or which gives pleasure, and the aspect of desirability or pleasurableness in that thing. Now according to Boethius (*De Hebdom.*)^11 "that which is can have something besides what it is, but ‘being’ itself has no admixture of anything else beside itself." Hence that which is desirable or pleasant can have an admixture of something rendering it undesirable or unpleasant, but the very aspect of pleasurableness has not and cannot have anything mixed with it rendering it unpleasant or undesirable. Now it is possible for things that are pleasurable, by participation of goodness which is the aspect of desirability or pleasurableness, not to give pleasure when they are apprehended, but it is impossible for that which is good by its essence not to give pleasure when it is apprehended. Therefore since God is essentially His own goodness, it is impossible for the Godhead to be seen without joy.

Reply Obj. 1. The wicked will know most clearly that Christ is God, not through seeing His Godhead, but on account of the most manifest signs of His Godhead.

Reply Obj. 2. No one can hate the Godhead considered in itself, as neither can one hate goodness itself. But God is said to be hated by certain persons in respect of some of the effects of the Godhead, in so far as He does or commands something contrary to their will. Therefore the vision of the Godhead can be painful to no one.

Reply Obj. 3. The saying of Augustine applies when the thing apprehended previously by the intellect is good by participation and not essentially, such as all creatures are; therefore there may be something in them by reason of which the affections are not moved. In like manner God is known by wayfarers through His effects, and their intellect does not attain to the very essence of His goodness. Hence it is not necessary that the affections follow the intellect, as they would if the intellect saw God’s essence which is His goodness.

Reply Obj. 4. Grief denotes not a disposition but a passion. Now every passion is removed if a stronger contrary cause supervene, and does not remove that cause. Accordingly the grief of the damned would be done away if they saw God in His essence.

Reply Obj. 5. The indisposition of an organ removes the natural proportion of the organ to the object that has a natural aptitude to please, and therefore the pleasure is hindered. But the indisposition which is in the damned does not remove the natural proportion whereby they are directed to the Divine goodness, since its image always remains in them. Hence the comparison fails.

# QUESTION XCI
## Of the quality of the world after THE JUDGMENT
### (In Five Articles)

We must next discuss the quality which the world and those who rise again will have after the judgment. Here a threefold matter offers itself to our consideration: (1) The state and quality of the world. (2) The state of the blessed (q. xcii). (3) The state of the wicked (q. xcvii).

Under the first head there are five points of inquiry:
1.  Whether there will be a renewal of the world?
2.  Whether the movement of the heavenly bodies will cease?
3.  Whether the heavenly bodies will be more brilliant?
4.  Whether the elements will receive an additional clarity?
5.  Whether the animals and plants will remain?

## Article 1. Whether the World Will Be Renewed?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the world will never be renewed.

Objection 1. For nothing will be but what was at some time as to its species: *What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be* (Eccl. 1:9). Now the world never had any disposition other than it has now as to essential parts, both genera and species. Therefore it will never be renewed.

Obj. 2. Further, Renewal is a kind of alteration. But it is impossible for the universe to be changed, because whatever is changed argues some alterant that is not changed, and which nevertheless is a subject of local movement, and it is impossible to place such a thing outside the universe. Therefore it is impossible for the world to be renewed.

Obj. 3. Further, It is stated (Gen. 2:2) that *God . . . rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done*, and holy men explain that He rested from forming new creatures.^12 Now when things were first established, the mode imposed upon them was the same as they have now in the natural order. Therefore they will never have any other.

Obj. 4. Further, The disposition which things have now is natural to them. Therefore if they be altered to another disposition, this disposition will be unnatural to them. Now whatever is unnatural and accidental cannot last for ever.^13 Therefore this disposition acquired by being renewed will be taken away from them, and thus there will be a cycle of changes in the world as Empedocles^14 and Origen (*Peri Archon*, ii, 3)^15 maintained, and after this world there will be another, and after that again another.

Obj. 5. Further, Newness of glory is given to the rational creature as a reward. Now where there is no merit, there can be no reward. Since then insensible creatures have merited nothing, it would seem that they will not be renewed.

On the contrary, It is written (Isa. 65:17): *Behold I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be in remembrance*; and (Apoc. 21:1): *I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth was gone*.

Further, The dwelling should befit the dweller. But the world was made to be man’s dwelling. Therefore it should befit man. Now man will be renewed. Therefore the world will be likewise.

Further, *Every beast loveth its like* (Ecclus. 13:19), and so it is evident that likeness is the reason of love. Now man has some likeness to the universe, for which reason he is called "a little world."^16 Hence man loves the whole world naturally and consequently desires its good. Therefore, that man’s desire be satisfied the universe must also be made better.

I answer that, We believe all corporeal things to have been made for man’s sake, and therefore *all things are stated to be subject to him* (Ps. 8:8). Now they serve man in two ways, first, as sustenance to his bodily life, secondly, as helping him to know God, since *man sees the invisible things of God by the things that are made* (Rom. 1:20). Accordingly glorified man will in no way need creatures to render him the first of these services, since his body will be altogether incorruptible, the Divine power effecting this through the soul which it will glorify immediately. Again man will not need the second service as to intellectual knowledge, since by that knowledge he will see God immediately in His essence. The carnal eye, however, will be unable to attain to this vision of the Essence; therefore that it may be fittingly comforted in the vision of God, it will see the Godhead in Its corporeal effects, wherein manifest proofs of the Divine majesty will appear, especially in Christ’s flesh, and secondarily in the bodies of the blessed, and afterwards in all other bodies. Hence those bodies also will need to receive a greater inflow from the Divine goodness than now, not indeed so as to change their species, but so as to add a certain perfection of glory, and such will be the renewal of the world. Therefore at the one same time, the world will be renewed, and man will be glorified.

Reply Obj. 1. Solomon is speaking there of the natural course; this is evident from his adding: *Nothing under the sun is new*. For since the movement of the sun follows a circle, those things which are subject to the sun’s power must have some kind of circular movement. This consists in the fact that things which were before return the same in species but different in the individual.^17 But things belonging to the state of glory are not *under the sun*.

Reply Obj. 2. This argument considers natural change which proceeds from a natural agent, which acts from natural necessity. For such an agent cannot produce different dispositions, unless it be itself disposed differently. But things done by God proceed from freedom of will, and therefore it is possible, without any change in God Who wills it, for the universe to have at one time one disposition, and another at another time. Thus this renewal will not be reduced to a cause that is moved, but to an immovable principle, namely God.

Reply Obj. 3. God is stated to have ceased on the seventh day forming new creatures, since nothing was made afterwards that was not previously in some likeness either generically, or specifically, or at least as in a seminal principle, or even as in an obediential potency. I say then that the future renewal of the world preceded in the works of the six days by way of a remote likeness, namely in the glory and grace of the angels. Moreover it preceded in the obediential potency which was then bestowed on the creature to the effect of its receiving this same renewal by the Divine agency.

Reply Obj. 4. This disposition of newness will be neither natural nor contrary to nature, but above nature (just as grace and glory are above the nature of the soul), and it will proceed from an everlasting agent which will preserve it for ever.

Reply Obj. 5. Although, properly speaking, insensible bodies will not have merited this glory, yet man merited that this glory should be bestowed on the whole universe, in so far as this conduces to man’s increase of glory. Thus a man merits to be clothed in more splendid robes, which splendor the robes in no way merited themselves.

## Article 2. Whether the Movement of the Heavenly Bodies Will Cease?

We thus proceed to the Second Article: It seems that when the world is thus renewed the movement of the heavenly bodies will not cease.

Objection 1. For it is written (Gen. 8:22): *All the days of the earth . . . cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day shall not cease*. Now night and day, summer and winter result from the movement of the sun. Therefore the movement of the sun will never cease.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (Jer. 31:35, 36): *Thus saith the Lord Who giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars for the light of the night: Who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar . . . . If these ordinances shall fail before Me . . . then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation before Me for ever*. Now the seed of Israel shall never fail, but will remain for ever. Therefore the laws of day and of the sea waves, which result from the heavenly movement, will remain for ever. Therefore the movement of the heaven will never cease.

Obj. 3. Further, The substance of the heavenly bodies will remain for ever. Now it is useless to admit the existence of a thing unless you admit the purpose for which it was made, and the heavenly bodies were made in order to *divide the day and the night, and to be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and for years* (Gen. 1:14). But they cannot do this except by movement. Therefore their movement will remain for ever, for otherwise those bodies would remain without a purpose.

Obj. 4. Further, In this renewal of the world the whole world will be bettered. Therefore no body will be deprived of what pertains to its perfection. Now movement belongs to the perfection of a heavenly body, because "those bodies participate of the Divine goodness by their movement."^18 Therefore the movement of the heaven will not cease.

Obj. 5. Further, The sun successively gives light to the various parts of the world, by reason of its circular movement. Therefore if the circular movement of the heaven ceases, it follows that in some part of the earth’s surface there will be perpetual darkness, which is unbecoming to the above mentioned renewal.

Obj. 6. Further, If the movement were to cease, this could only be because movement causes some imperfection in the heaven, for instance wear and tear, which is impossible, since this movement is natural, and the heavenly bodies are impassible; therefore they are not worn out by movement.^19 Therefore the movement of the heaven will never cease.

Obj. 7. Further, A potency is useless if it is not reduced to act. Now in whatever position the heavenly body is placed it is in potency to another position. Therefore unless this potency is reduced to act, it would remain useless, and would always be imperfect. But it cannot be reduced to act save by local movement. Therefore it will always be in motion.

Obj. 8. Further, If a thing is indifferent in relation to more than one thing, either both are ascribed to it, or neither. Now the sun is indifferent to being in the east or in the west; otherwise its movement would not be uniform throughout, since it would move more rapidly to the place which is more natural to it. Therefore

Therefore either neither position is ascribed to the sun, or both. But neither both nor neither can be ascribed to it, except successively by movement; for if it stands still, it has to stand in some position. Therefore the solar body will always be in motion, and in like manner all other heavenly bodies.

Obj. 9. Further, The movement of the heaven is the cause of time. Therefore if the movement of the heaven fail, time must fail, and if this were to fail, it would fail in an instant. Now an instant is defined as “the beginning of the future and the end of the past.”^3 Consequently there would be time after the last instant of time, which is impossible. Therefore the movement of the heavens will never cease.

Obj. 10. Further, Glory does not remove nature. But the movement of the heaven is natural. Therefore it is not deprived of its movement by glory.

On the contrary, It is stated (Apoc. 10:6) that the angel who appeared, swore by him that liveth for ever and ever . . . that *time shall be no longer*, namely after the seventh angel shall have sounded the trumpet, at the sound of which the dead shall rise again (1 Cor. 15:52). Now if time is not, there is no movement of the heaven. Therefore the movement of the heaven will cease.

Further: *Thy sun shall go down no more, and thy moon shall not decrease* (Isa. 60:20). Now the setting of the sun and the phases of the moon are caused by the movement of the heavens. Therefore the heavenly movement will cease at length.

Further, It is shown in the treatise on *Generation and Corruption*^4 that “the movement of the heaven is for the sake of continual generation in this lower world.” But generation will cease when the number of the elect is complete. Therefore the movement of the heaven will cease.

Further, All movement is for some end.^5 But all movement for an end ceases when the end is obtained. Therefore either the movement of the heaven will never obtain its end, and thus it would be useless, or it will cease at length.

Further, Rest is more noble than movement, because things are more likened to God, Who is supremely immovable, by being themselves unmoved. Now the movement of lower bodies terminates naturally in rest. Therefore since the heavenly bodies are far nobler, their movement terminates naturally in rest.

I answer that, There are three opinions touching this question. The first is of the philosophers who assert that the movement of the heaven will last for ever. But this is not in keeping with our faith, which holds that the elect are in a certain number preordained by God, so that the begetting of men will not last for ever, and for the same reason, neither will other things that are directed to the begetting of men, such as the movement of the heaven and the variations of the elements. Others say that the movement of the heaven will cease naturally. But this again is false, since every body that is moved naturally has a place in which it rests naturally, to which it is moved naturally, and from which it is not moved except by violence. Now no such place can be assigned to the heavenly body, since it is not more natural to the sun to move towards a point in the east than to move away from it, and so either its movement would not be altogether natural, or its movement would not naturally terminate in rest. Hence we must agree with others who say that the movement of the heaven will cease at this renewal of the world, not indeed by any natural cause, but as a result of the will of God. For the body in question, like other bodies, was made to serve man in the two ways above mentioned (Art. 1), and hereafter in the state of glory man will no longer need one of these services, that namely in respect of which the heavenly bodies serve man for the sustenance of his bodily life. Now in this way the heavenly bodies serve man by their movement, in so far as by the heavenly movement the human race is multiplied, plants and animals needful for man’s use generated, and the temperature of the atmosphere rendered conducive to health. Therefore the movement of the heavenly body will cease as soon as man is glorified.

Reply Obj. 1. These words refer to the earth in its present state, when it is able to be the principle of the generation and corruption of plants. This is evident from its being said there: *All the days of the earth, seed time and harvest*, etc. And it is to be granted absolutely that as long as the earth is fit for seed time and harvest, the movement of the heaven will not cease.

We reply in like manner to Obj. 2 that the Lord is speaking there of the duration of the seed of Israel with regard to the present state. This is evident from the words: *Then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation before Me for ever*. For after this state there will be no succession of days, and therefore the laws also which He had mentioned will cease after this state.

Reply Obj. 3. The end which is there assigned to the heavenly bodies is their proximate end, because it is their proper act. But this act is directed further to another end, namely the service of man, which is shown by the words of Deut. 4:19: *Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven*. Therefore we should form our judgment of the heavenly bodies from the service of man, rather than from the end assigned to them in Genesis. Moreover the heavenly bodies, as stated above, will serve glorified man in another way; hence it does not follow that they will remain without a purpose.

Reply Obj. 4. Movement does not belong to the perfection of a heavenly body, except in so far as thereby it is the cause of generation and corruption in this lower world, and in that respect also this movement makes the heavenly body participate in the Divine goodness by way of a certain likeness of causality. But movement does not belong to the perfection of the substance of the heaven, which substance will remain. Therefore it does not follow that when this movement ceases, the substance of the heaven will lose something of its perfection.

Reply Obj. 5. All the elemental bodies will have in themselves a certain clarity of glory. Hence though part of the surface of the earth may not be lit up by the sun, there will by no means be any darkness there.

Reply Obj. 6. A gloss of Ambrose on Rom. 8:22, *Every creature groaneth*, etc., says^6 that “all the elements labour to fulfil their offices: thus the sun and moon fill the places appointed to them not without work; this is for our sake, and so they will rest when we are taken up to heaven.” This work, in my opinion, does not signify that any stress or passion occurs to these bodies from their movement, since this movement is natural to them and in no way violent, as is proved in the book on the *Heavens*^7. But work here denotes a defect in relation to the term to which a thing tends. Hence since this movement is ordained by Divine providence to the completion of the number of the elect, it follows that as long as the latter is incomplete, this movement has not reached the term to which it was ordered; hence it is said metaphorically to labour, as a man who has not what he intends to have. This defect will be removed from the heaven when the number of the elect is complete. Or it may refer to the desire of the future renewal, which it awaits from the Divine disposal.

Reply Obj. 7. In a heavenly body there is no potency that can be perfected by place, or that is made for this end, which is to be in such and such a place. But potency to situation in a place is related to a heavenly body as the craftsman’s potency to construct various houses of one kind; for if he construct one of these he is not said to have the potency uselessly, and in like manner in whatever situation a heavenly body be placed, its potency to be in a place will not remain incomplete or without a purpose.

Reply Obj. 8. Although a heavenly body, so far as regards its nature, is equally inclined to every situation that it can possibly occupy, nevertheless, in comparison with things outside it, it is not equally inclined to every situation, but in respect of one situation it has a more noble disposition in comparison with certain things than in respect of another situation; thus, in our regard, the sun has a more noble disposition at daytime than at nighttime. Hence it is probable, since the entire renewal of the world is directed to man, that the heaven will have in this renewal the most noble situation possible in relation to our dwelling there. Or, according to some, the heaven will rest in that situation in which it was made, for otherwise one of its revolutions would remain incomplete. But this argument seems improbable, for since a revolution of the heaven takes no less than 36,000 years to complete, it would follow that the world must last that length of time, which does not seem probable. Moreover according to this it would be possible to know when the world will come to an end. For we may conclude with probability from astronomers in what position the heavenly bodies were made, by taking into consideration the number of years that have elapsed since the beginning of the world, and in the same way it would be possible to know the exact number of years it would take them to return to a like position; but the time of the world’s end is stated to be unknown.

Reply Obj. 9. Time will at length cease, when the heavenly movement ceases. Yet that last “now” will not be the beginning of the future. For the definition quoted applies to the “now” only as continuous with the parts of time, not as terminating the whole of time.

Reply Obj. 10. The movement of the heaven is said to be natural, not as though it were part of nature in the same way as we speak of natural principles, but because it has its principle in the nature of a body, not indeed its active but its receptive principle. Its active principle is a spiritual substance, as the Commentator says on the treatise on the *Heavens*^8; and consequently it is not unreasonable for this movement to be done away by the renewal of glory, since the nature of the heavenly body will not alter through the cessation of that movement.

We grant the other objections which argue in the contrary sense, namely the first three, because they conclude in due manner. But since the remaining two seem to conclude that the movement of the heaven will cease naturally, we must reply to them.

To the first, then, we reply that movement ceases when its purpose is attained, provided this is a sequel to, and does not accompany the movement. Now the purpose of the heavenly movement, according to philosophers, accompanies that movement, namely the imitation of the Divine goodness in the causality of that movement with respect to this lower world. Hence it does not follow that this movement ceases naturally.

To the second we reply that although immobility is nobler absolutely than movement, yet movement in a subject which thereby can acquire a perfect participation of the Divine goodness is nobler than rest in a subject which is altogether unable to acquire that perfection by movement. For this reason the earth which is the lowest of the elements is without movement, although God Who is exalted above all things is without movement, by Whom the more noble bodies are moved. Hence also it is that the movements of the higher bodies might be held to be perpetual, so far as their natural power is concerned, and never to terminate in rest, although the movement of lower bodies terminates in rest.

## Article 3. Whether the Brightness of the Heavenly Bodies Will Be Increased at This Renewal?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the brightness of the heavenly bodies will not be increased at this renewal.

Objection 1. For this renewal as regards the lower bodies will be caused by the cleansing fire. But the cleansing fire will not reach the heavenly bodies. Therefore the heavenly bodies will not be renewed by receiving an increase of brightness.

Obj. 2. Further, Just as the heavenly bodies are the cause of generation in this lower world by their movement, so are they by their light. But, when generation ceases, movement will cease as stated above (Art. 2). Therefore in like manner the light of the heavenly bodies will cease rather than increase.

Obj. 3. Further, If the heavenly bodies will be renewed when man is renewed, it follows that when man deteriorated they deteriorated likewise. But this does not seem probable, since these bodies are unalterable as to their substance. Therefore neither will they be renewed when man is renewed.

Obj. 4. Further, If they deteriorated then, it follows that their deterioration was on a par with the amelioration which, it is said, will accrue to them at man’s renewal. Now it is written (Isa. 30:26) that *the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun*. Therefore in the original state before sin the moon shone as much as the sun does now. Therefore whenever the moon was over the earth, it made it to be day as the sun does now, which is proved manifestly to be false from the statement of Gen. 1:16 that *the moon was made to rule the night*. Therefore when man sinned, the heavenly bodies were not deprived of their light; and so their light will not be increased, so it seems, when man is glorified.

Obj. 5. Further, The brightness of the heavenly bodies, like other creatures, is directed to the use of man. Now, after the resurrection, the brightness of the sun will be of no use to man, for it is written (Isa. 60:19): *Thou shalt no more have the sun for thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee*, and (Apoc. 21:23): *The city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon to shine in it*. Therefore their brightness will not be increased.

Obj. 6. Further, It would not be a wise craftsman who would make very great instruments for the making of a small work. Now man is a very small thing in comparison with the heavenly bodies, which by their huge bulk surpass the size of man almost beyond comparison; in fact the size of the whole earth in comparison with the heaven is as a point compared with a sphere, as astronomers say.^9 Since then God is most wise it would seem that man is not the end of the creation of the heavens, and so it does not seem that the heaven should deteriorate when he sinned, or that it should be bettered when he is glorified.

On the contrary, It is written (Isa. 30:26): *The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold*.

Further, The whole world will be renewed for the better. But the heaven is the more noble part of the corporeal world. Therefore it will be changed for the better. But this cannot be unless it shine out with greater brightness. Therefore its brightness will be bettered and will increase.

Further, *Every creature that groaneth and travaileth in pain, awaiteth the revelation of the glory of the children of God* (Rom. 8:21-22).^10 Now such are the heavenly bodies, as a gloss says^11 on the same passage. Therefore they await the glory of the saints. But they would not await it unless they were to gain something by it. Therefore their brightness will increase thereby, since it is their chief beauty.

I answer that, The renewal of the world is directed to the end that after this renewal has taken place God may become visible to man by signs so manifest as to be perceived, as it were, by his senses. Now creatures lead to the knowledge of God chiefly by their comeliness and beauty, which show forth the wisdom of their Maker and Governor; therefore it is written (Wisd. 13:5): *By the greatness of the beauty and of the creature, the Creator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby*. And the beauty of the heavenly bodies consists chiefly in light; hence it is written (Ecclus. 43:10): *The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven, the Lord enlighteneth the world on high*. Hence the heavenly bodies will be bettered, especially as regards their brightness. But to what degree and in what way this betterment will take place is known to Him alone Who will bring it about.

Reply Obj. 1. The cleansing fire will not cause the form of the renewal, but will only dispose to it, by cleansing from the vileness of sin and the impurity resulting from the mingling of bodies, and this is not to be found in the heavenly bodies. Hence although the heavenly bodies are not to be cleansed by fire, they are nevertheless to be Divinely renewed.

Reply Obj. 2. Movement does not denote perfection in the thing moved, considered in itself, since movement is the act of that which is imperfect, although it may pertain to the perfection of the body in so far as the latter is the cause of something. But light belongs to the perfection of a lightsome body, even considered in its substance, and consequently after the heavenly body has ceased to be the cause of generation, its brightness will remain, while its movement will cease.

Reply Obj. 3. A gloss on Isa. 30:26, *The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun*, says:^12 “All things made for man’s sake deteriorated at his fall, and sun and moon diminished in light.” This diminishment is understood by some to mean a real lessening of light. Nor does it matter that the heavenly bodies are by nature unalterable, because this alteration was brought about by the Divine power.

Others, however, with greater probability, take this diminishment to mean, not a real lessening of light, but a lessening in reference to man’s use; because after sin man did not receive as much benefit from the light of the heavenly bodies as before. In the same sense we read (Gen. 3:17-18): *Cursed is the earth in thy work. . . . Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee*; although it would have brought forth thorns and thistles before sin, but not as a punishment to man.

Nor does it follow that, supposing the light of the heavenly bodies not to have been lessened essentially through man sinning, it will not really be increased at man’s glorification, because man’s sin wrought no change upon the state of the universe, since both before and after sin man had an animal life, which needs the movement and generation of a corporeal creature; but man’s glorification will bring a change upon the state of all corporeal creatures, as stated above (Art. 1). Hence there is no comparison.

Reply Obj. 4. This lessening, according to the more probable opinion, refers not to the substance but to the effect. Hence it does not follow that the moon while over the earth would have made it to be day, but that man would have derived as much benefit from the light of the moon then as now from the light of the sun. After the resurrection, however, when the light of the moon will be increased in very truth, there will be night nowhere on earth but only in the centre of the earth, where hell will be, because then, as stated, the moon will shine as brightly as the sun does now; the sun seven times as much as now, and the bodies of the blessed seven times more than the sun, although there is no authority or reason to prove this.

Reply Obj. 5. A thing may be useful to man in two ways. First, by reason of necessity, and thus no creature will be useful to man because he will have complete sufficiency from God. This is signified (Apoc. 21:23) by the words quoted, according to which *that city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon*. Secondly, on account of a greater perfection, and thus man will make use of other creatures, yet not as necessary to him in order to obtain his end, in which way he makes use of them now.

Reply Obj. 6. This is the argument of Moses Maimonides who endeavours to prove^13 that the world was by no means made for man’s use. Therefore he maintains that what we read in the Old Testament about the renewal of the world, as instanced by the quotations from Isaias, is said metaphorically,^14 and that even as the sun is said to be darkened in reference to a person when he encounters a great sorrow so as not to know what to do (which way of speaking is customary to Scripture), so on the other hand the sun is said to shine brighter for a person, and the whole world to be renewed, when he is brought from a state of sorrow to one of very great joy. But this is not in harmony with the authority and commentaries of holy men. Consequently we must answer this argument by saying that although the heavenly bodies far surpass the human body, yet the rational soul surpasses the heavenly bodies far more than these surpass the human body. Hence it is not unreasonable to say that the heavenly bodies were made for man’s sake; not, however, as though this were the principal end, since the principal end of all things is God.

## Article 4. Whether the Elements Will Be Renewed By an Addition of Brightness?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the elements will not be renewed by receiving some kind of brightness.

Objection 1. For just as light is a quality proper to a heavenly body, so are hot and cold, wet and dry, qualities proper to the elements. Therefore as the heaven is renewed by an increase of brightness, so ought the elements to be renewed by an increase of active and passive qualities.

Obj. 2. Further, Rarity and density are qualities of the elements, and the elements will not be deprived of them at this renewal. Now the rarity and density of the elements would seem to be an obstacle to brightness, since a bright body needs to be condensed, for which reason the rarity of the air seems incompatible with brightness, and in like manner the density of the earth, which is an obstacle to transparency. Therefore it is impossible for the elements to be renewed by the addition of brightness.

Obj. 3. Further, It is agreed that the damned will be in the earth. Yet they will be in darkness not only internal but also external. Therefore the earth will not be endowed with brightness in this renewal, nor for the same reason will the other elements.

Obj. 4. Further, Increase of brightness in the elements implies an increase of heat. If therefore at this renewal the brightness of the elements be greater than it is now, their heat will likewise be greater; and thus it would seem that they will be changed from their natural qualities, which are in them according to a fixed measure, and this is absurd.

Obj. 5. Further, The good of the universe which consists in the order and harmony of the parts is more excellent than the good of any individual creature. But if one creature be bettered, the good of the universe is done away, since there will no longer be the same harmony. Therefore if the elemental bodies, which according to their natural degree in the universe should be devoid of brightness, were to be endowed with brightness, the perfection of the universe would be diminished thereby rather than increased.

On the contrary, It is written (Apoc. 21:1): *I saw a new heaven and a new earth*. Now the heaven will be renewed by an increase of brightness. Therefore the earth and likewise the other elements will also.

Further, The lower bodies, like the higher, are for man’s use. Now the corporeal creature will be rewarded for its services to man, as a gloss of Ambrose seems to say^15 on Rom. 8:22, *Every creature groaneth*. Therefore the elements will be glorified as well as the heavenly bodies.

Further, Man’s body is composed of the elements. Therefore the elemental particles that are in man’s body will be glorified by the addition of brightness when man is glorified. Now it is fitting that whole and part should have the same disposition. Therefore it is fitting that the elements themselves should be endowed with brightness.

I answer that, Just as there is a certain order between the heavenly spirits and the earthly, that is, human spirits, so is there an order between heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. Since then the corporeal creature was made for the sake of the spiritual and is ruled thereby, it follows that corporeal things are dealt with similarly to spiritual things. Now in this final consummation of things the lower spirits will receive the properties of the higher spirits, because men will be as the angels in heaven (Matt. 22:30); and this will be accomplished by conferring the highest degree of perfection on that in which the human spirit agrees with the angelic. Therefore, in like manner, since the lower bodies do not agree with the heavenly bodies except in the nature of light and transparency, it follows that the lower bodies are to be perfected chiefly as regards brightness. Hence all the elements will be clothed with a certain brightness, not equally, however, but according to their mode; for it is said that the earth on its outward surface will be as transparent as glass, water as crystal, the air as heaven, fire as the lights of heaven.

Reply Obj. 1. As stated above (Art. 1), the renewal of the world is directed to the effect that man even by his senses may, as it were, see the Godhead by manifest signs. Now the most spiritual and subtle of our senses is the sight. Consequently all the lower bodies need to be bettered, chiefly as regards the visible qualities, the principle of which is light. On the other hand, the elemental qualities regard the touch, which is the most material of the senses, and the excess of their contrariety is more displeasing than pleasant; but excess of light will be pleasant, since it has no contrariety, except on account of a weakness in the organ, such as will not be then.

Reply Obj. 2. The air will be bright, not as casting forth rays, but as an enlightened transparency; while the earth, although it is opaque through lack of light, yet by the Divine power

its surface will be clothed with the glory of brightness, without prejudice to its density.

Reply Obj. 3. The earth will not be glorified with brightness in the infernal regions; but instead of this glory, that part of the earth will have the rational spirits of men and demons, who though weak by reason of sin are nevertheless superior to any corporeal quality by the dignity of their nature. Or we may say that, even though the whole earth is glorified, the wicked will nevertheless be in exterior darkness, since even the fire of hell, while shining for them in one respect, will be unable to enlighten them in another.

Reply Obj. 4. This brightness will be in these bodies even as it is in the heavenly bodies, in which it causes no heat, because these bodies will then be unalterable, as the heavenly bodies are now.

Reply Obj. 5. The order of the universe will not be done away by the betterment of the elements, because all the other parts will also be bettered, and so the same harmony will remain.

## SUMMA THEOLOGICA

### Article 5. Whether the Plants and Animals Will Remain in This Renewal?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that the plants and animals will remain in this renewal.

Objection 1. For the elements should be deprived of nothing that belongs to their adornment. Now the elements are said to be adorned by the animals and plants. Therefore they will not be removed in this renewal.

Obj. 2. Further, Just as the elements served man, so also did animals, plants, and mineral bodies. But on account of this service the elements will be glorified.1 Therefore both animals and plants and mineral bodies will be glorified likewise.

Obj. 3. Further, The universe will remain imperfect if anything belonging to its perfection is removed. Now the species of animals, plants, and mineral bodies belong to the perfection of the universe. Since then we must not say that the world will remain imperfect when it is renewed, it seems that we should assert that the plants and animals will remain.

Obj. 4. Further, Animals and plants have a more noble form than the elements. Now the world, at this final renewal, will be changed for the better. Therefore animals and plants should remain rather than the elements, since they are nobler.

Obj. 5. Further, It is unfitting to assert that the natural appetite will be frustrated. But by their natural appetite animals and plants desire to be for ever, if indeed not as regards the individual, at least as regards the species; and to this end their continual generation is directed.2 Therefore it is unfitting to say that these species will at length cease to be.

On the contrary, If plants and animals are to remain, either all of them will, or some of them. If all of them, then dumb animals, which had previously died, will have to rise again, just as men will rise again. But this cannot be asserted, for since their form comes to nothing, they cannot resume the same identical form. On the other hand if not all but some of them remain, since there is no more reason for one of them remaining for ever rather than another, it would seem that none of them will. But whatever remains after the world has been renewed will remain for ever, generation and corruption being done away. Therefore plants and animals will altogether cease after the renewal of the world.

1 Cf. a. 4, on the contrary, 2.
2 Aristotle, *Generation and Corruption*, II, 10 (336b27).

Further, According to the Philosopher3 the species of animals, plants, and the like corruptible things, are not perpetuated except by the continuance of the heavenly movement. Now this will cease then. Therefore it will be impossible for those species to be perpetuated.

Further, If the end cease, those things which are directed to the end should cease. Now animals and plants were made for the upkeep of human life; hence it is written (Gen. 9. 3): >Even as the green herbs have I delivered all flesh to you (Vulg.,—have I delivered them all to you). Therefore when men’s animal life ceases, animals and plants should cease. But after this renewal animal life will cease in man. Therefore neither plants nor animals ought to remain.

I answer that, Since the renewal of the world will be for man’s sake it follows that it should be conformed to the renewal of man. Now by being renewed man will pass from the state of corruption to incorruptibility and to a state of everlasting rest, and therefore it is written (1 Cor. 15. 53): >This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality; and consequently the world will be renewed in such a way as to throw off all corruption and remain for ever at rest. Therefore it will be impossible for anything to be the subject of that renewal, unless it be a subject of incorruption. Now such are the heavenly bodies, the elements, and man. For the heavenly bodies are by their very nature incorruptible both as to their whole and as to their part, the elements are corruptible as to their parts but incorruptible as a whole, while men are corruptible both in whole and in part, but this is on the part of their matter not on the part of their form, the rational soul namely, which will remain incorrupt after the corruption of man. On the other hand, dumb animals, plants, and minerals, and all mixed bodies, are corruptible both in their whole and in their parts, both on the part of their matter which loses its form, and on the part of their form which does not remain actually; and thus they are in no way subjects of incorruption. Hence they will not remain in this renewal, but those things alone which we have mentioned above.

Reply Obj. 1. These bodies are said to adorn the elements, in so far as the general active and passive forces which are in the elements are applied to specific actions; hence they adorn the elements in their active and passive state. But this state will not remain in the elements.

3 Ibid. (336a15).

### SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 92 ART. 1 1025

Therefore there is no need for animals or plants to remain.

Reply Obj. 2. Neither animals nor plants nor any other bodies merited anything by their services to man, since they lack free choice. However, certain bodies are said to be rewarded in so far as man merited that those things should be renewed which are adapted to be renewed. But plants and animals are not adapted to the renewal of incorruption, as stated above. Therefore for this very reason man did not merit that they should be renewed, since no one can merit for another, or even for himself, that which another or himself is incapable of receiving. Hence, granted even that dumb animals merited by serving man, it would not follow that they are to be renewed.

Reply Obj. 3. Just as several kinds of perfection are ascribed to man (for there is the perfection of created nature and the perfection of glorified nature), so also there is a twofold perfection of the universe, one corresponding to this state of changeableness, the other corresponding to the state of a future renewal. Now plants and animals belong to its perfection according to the present state, and not according to the state of this renewal, since they are not capable of it.

Reply Obj. 4. Although animals and plants as to certain other respects are more noble than the elements, the elements are more noble in relation to incorruption, as explained above.

Reply Obj. 5. The natural desire to be for ever that is in animals and plants must be understood in reference to the movement of the heaven, so that they may continue in being as long as the movement of the heaven lasts, for there cannot be an appetite for an effect to last longer than its cause. Therefore if at the cessation of movement in the first movable body, plants and animals cease as to their species, it does not follow that the natural appetite is frustrated.

## QUESTION XCII

### Of the vision of the divine essence in reference to the blessed

(In Three Articles)

In the next place we must consider matters concerning the blessed after the general judgment. We shall consider: (1) Their vision of the Divine essence in which their Happiness consists chiefly. (2) Their Happiness and their mansions (q. XCIII). (3) Their relations with the damned (q. XCIV). (4) Their gifts, which are contained in their Happiness (q. XCV). (5) The crowns which perfect and adorn their Happiness (q. XCVI).

Under the first head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether the saints will see God in His essence? (2) Whether they will see Him with the eyes of the body? (3) Whether in seeing God they will see all that God sees?

### Article 1. Whether the Human Intellect Can Attain to the Vision of God in His Essence?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the human intellect cannot attain to the vision of God in His essence.

Objection 1. For it is written (John 1. 18): >No man hath seen God at any time; and Chrysostom in his commentary says (*Hom. xv in Joann.*)1 that “not even the heavenly essences, namely the Cherubim and Seraphim, have ever been able to see Him as He is.” Now, only equality with the angels is promised to men (Matt. 22. 30): >They . . . shall be as the angels of God in heaven. Therefore neither will the saints in heaven see God in His essence.

Obj. 2. Further, Dionysius argues thus (*Div. Nom.* I):2 >Knowledge is only of existing things. Now whatever exists is finite, since it is confined to a certain genus, and therefore God, since He is infinite, is above all existing things. Therefore there is no knowledge of Him, and He is above all knowledge.

Obj. 3. Further, Dionysius (*De Myst. Theol.* I)3 shows that the most perfect way in which our intellect can be united to God is when it is united to Him as to something unknown. Now that which is seen in its essence is not unknown. Therefore it is impossible for our intellect to see God in His essence.

Obj. 4. Further, Dionysius says (*Ep. ad Caium Monach.*)4 that “the darkness,”—for thus he calls the abundance of light,—“which screens God is impervious to all illuminations, and hidden from all knowledge; and if anyone in seeing God understood what he saw, he saw not God Himself, but one of those things that are His.” Therefore no created intellect will be able to see God in His essence.

Obj. 5. Further, According to Dionysius (*Ep. ad Doroth.*)5 “God is invisible on account of His surpassing glory.” Now His glory surpasses the human intellect in heaven even as on the way. Therefore since He is invisible on the way, so will He be in heaven.

4 *Epist.*, 1 (PG 3, 1065).
5 *Epist.*, V (PG 3, 1073).

### 1026 SUMMA THEOLOGICA

Obj. 6. Further, Since the intelligible is the perfection of the intellect, there must be proportion between intelligible and intellect, as between the visible and the sight. But there is no possible proportion between our intellect and the Divine essence, since an infinite distance separates them. Therefore our intellect will be unable to attain to the vision of the Divine essence.

Obj. 7. Further, God is more distant from our intellect than the created intelligible is from our senses. But the senses can in no way attain to the sight of a spiritual creature. Therefore neither will our intellect be able to attain to the vision of the Divine essence.

Obj. 8. Further, Whenever the intellect understands something actually it needs to be informed with the likeness of the object understood, which likeness is the principle of the intellectual operation terminating in that object, even as heat is the principle of heating. Accordingly if our intellect understands God, this must be by means of some likeness informing the intellect itself. Now this cannot be the very essence of God, since form and things informed must have one being, while the Divine essence differs from our intellect in essence and being. Therefore the form by which our intellect is informed in understanding God must be a likeness impressed by God on our intellect. But this likeness, being something created, cannot lead to the knowledge of God, except as an effect leads to the knowledge of its cause. Therefore it is impossible for our intellect to see God except through His effect. But to see God through His effect is not to see Him in His essence. Therefore our intellect will be unable to see God in His essence.

Obj. 9. Further, The Divine essence is more distant from our intellect than any angel or intelligence. Now according to Avicenna (*Met.* III, 8),1 “the existence of an intelligence in our intellect does not imply that its essence is in our intellect,” because in that case our knowledge of the intelligence would be a substance and not an accident, “but that its impression is in our intellect.” Therefore neither is God in our intellect, so as to be understood by us, except in so far as an impression of Him is in our intellect. But this impression cannot lead to the knowledge of the Divine essence, for since it is infinitely distant from the Divine essence, it degenerates to another species, much more than if the species of a white thing were to degenerate to the species of a black thing. Therefore, just as a person in whose sight the species of a white thing degenerates to the species of a black thing, on account of an indisposition in the organ, is not said to see a white thing, so neither will our intellect be able to see God in His essence, since it understands God only by means of this impression.

Obj. 10. Further, “In things separate from matter that which understands is the same as that which is understood.”2

Now God is supremely separate from matter. Since then our intellect, which is created, cannot attain to be an uncreated essence, it is impossible for our intellect to see God in His essence.

Obj. 11. Further, Whatever is seen in its essence is known as to what it is. But our intellect cannot know of God what He is, but only what He is not, as Dionysius (*De Coel. Hier.* II)3 and Damascene (*De Fide Orthod.* I, 4)4 declare. Therefore our intellect will be unable to see God in His essence.

Obj. 12. Further, Every infinite thing, as such, is unknown. But God is in every way infinite. Therefore He is altogether unknown. Therefore it will be impossible for Him to be seen in His essence by a created intellect.

Obj. 13. Further, Augustine says (*De Videndo Deo: Ep. CXLVII, 15*) :5 “God is by nature invisible.” Now that which is in God by nature cannot be otherwise. Therefore it is impossible for Him to be seen in His essence.

Obj. 14. Further, Whatever is in one way and is seen in another way is not seen as it is. Now God is in one way and will be seen in another way by the saints in heaven; for He is according to His own mode, but will be seen by the saints according to their mode. Therefore He will not be seen by the saints as He is, and thus will not be seen in His essence.

Obj. 15. Further, That which is seen through a medium is not seen in its essence. Now God will be seen in heaven through a medium which is the light of glory, according to Ps. 35. 10, >In Thy light we shall see light. Therefore He will not be seen in His essence.

Obj. 16. Further, In heaven God will be seen face to face, according to 1 Cor. 13. 12. Now when we see a man face to face, we see him through his likeness. Therefore in heaven God will be seen through His likeness, and consequently not in His essence.

On the contrary, It is written (1 Cor. 13. 12): >We see now through a glass in a dark manner,

### SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 92 ART. 1 1027

>but then face to face. Now that which is seen face to face is seen in its essence. Therefore God will be seen in His essence by the saints in heaven.

Further, It is written (1 John 3. 2): >When He shall appear we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as He is. Therefore we shall see Him in His essence.

Further, A gloss on 1 Cor. 15. 24, >When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, says:1 “Where,” that is, in heaven, “the essence of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost shall be seen, this is given to the clean of heart alone and is the highest happiness.” Therefore the blessed will see God in His essence.

Further, It is written (John 14. 21): >He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. Now that which is manifested is seen in its essence. Therefore God will be seen in His essence by the saints in heaven.

Further, Gregory commenting (*Moral.* XVIII, 54)2 on the words of Exod. 33. 20, >Man shall not see Me and live, disapproves of the opinion of those who said that “in this abode of bliss God can be seen in His glory but not in His nature; for His glory differs not from His nature.” But His nature is His essence. Therefore He will be seen in His essence.

Further, The desire of the saints cannot be altogether frustrated. Now the common desire of the saints is to see God in His essence, according to Exod. 33. 13, >Show me Thy glory; Ps. 79. 20, >Show Thy face and we shall be saved; and John 14. 8, >Show us the Father and it is enough for us. Therefore the saints will see God in His essence.

I answer that, Even as we hold by faith that the last end of man’s life is to see God, so the philosophers maintained that man’s ultimate happiness is to understand immaterial substances according to their being. Hence in reference to this question we find that philosophers and theologians encounter the same difficulty and the same difference of opinion. For some philosophers held that our possible intellect can never come to understand separate substances; thus Alfarabi expresses himself at the end of his *Ethics*,3 although he says the contrary in his book *On the Intelligence*,4 as the Commentator attests (*De Anima*, III).5 In like manner certain theologians held that the human intellect can never attain to the vision of God in His essence. On either side they were moved by the distance which separates our intellect from the Divine essence and from separate substances. For since the intellect in act is in some way one with the intelligible in act, it would seem difficult to understand how the created intellect is made in any way to be an uncreated essence. Therefore Chrysostom says (*Hom. xv in Joann.*),6 “How can the creature see the uncreated?” Those who hold the possible intellect to be the subject of generation and corruption, as being a power dependent on the body, encounter a still greater difficulty not only as regards the vision of God but also as regards the vision of any separate substances.

But this opinion is altogether untenable. First, because it is in contradiction to the authority of canonical scripture, as Augustine declares (*De Videndo Deo: Ep. CXLVII, 5*).7 Secondly because, since understanding is an operation most proper to man, it follows that his happiness must be held to consist in that operation when perfected in him. Now since the perfection of an intelligent being as such is the intelligible thing, if in the most perfect operation of his intellect man does not attain to the vision of the Divine essence, but to something else, we shall be forced to conclude that something other than God makes man happy; and since the ultimate perfection of a thing consists in its being united to its principle, it follows that something other than God is the effecting principle of man, which is absurd, according to us, and also according to the philosophers, who maintain that our souls emanate from the separate substances, so that finally we may be able to understand these substances. Consequently, according to us, it must be asserted that our intellect will at length attain to the vision of the Divine essence, and according to the philosophers, that it will attain to the vision of separate substances.

It remains, then, to examine how this may come about. For some, like Alfarabi and Avempace, held that from the very fact that our intellect understands any intelligibles whatever, it attains to the vision of a separate substance. To show this they proceed in two ways. The first is that just as the specific nature is not diversified in various individuals, except as united to various individuating principles, so the form understood is not diversified in me and you, except in so far as it is united to various imaginary forms; and consequently

### 1028 SUMMA THEOLOGICA

when the intellect separates the form understood from the imaginary forms, there remains a quiddity understood, which is one and the same in the various persons understanding it, and such is the quiddity of a separate substance. Hence, when our intellect attains to the supreme abstraction of any intelligible quiddity, it thereby understands the quiddity of the separate substance that is similar to it.1

The second way is that our intellect has a natural aptitude to abstract the quiddity from all intelligible objects having a quiddity. If, then, the quiddity which it abstracts from some particular individual be a quiddity without a quiddity, the intellect by understanding it understands the quiddity of the separate substance which has a like disposition, since separate substances are subsisting quiddities without quiddities; for the quiddity of a simple thing is the simple thing itself, as Avicenna says.2 On the other hand if the quiddity abstracted from this particular sensible be a quiddity that has a quiddity, it follows that the intellect has a natural aptitude to abstract this quiddity, and consequently since we cannot go on infinitely, we shall come to some quiddity without a quiddity, and this is what we understand by a separate quiddity.3

But this way does not seem to be enough. First, because the quiddity of the material substance, which the intellect abstracts, is not of the same character as the quiddity of the separate substances, and consequently from the fact that our intellect abstracts the quiddities of material things and knows them, it does not follow that it knows the quiddity of a separate substance, especially of the Divine essence, which more than any other is of a different character from any created quiddity. Secondly, because granted that it be of the same character, nevertheless the knowledge of a composite thing would not lead to the knowledge of a separate substance, except in the point of the most remote genus, namely substance; and such a knowledge is imperfect unless it reach to the properties of a thing. For to know a man only as an animal is to know him only in a restricted sense and potentially; and much less is it to know only the nature of substance in him. Hence to know God thus, or other separate substances, is not to see the essence of God or the quiddity of a separate substance,

but to know Him in His effect and in a mirror as it were.

For this reason Avicenna in his *Metaphysics*4 propounds another way of understanding separate substances, namely, that separate substances are understood by us by means of intentions of their quiddities, such intentions being likenesses of their substances, not indeed abstracted from them, since they are immaterial, but impressed by them on our souls. But this way also seems inadequate to the Divine vision which we seek. For it is agreed that “whatever is received into anything is in it after the mode of the recipient,” and consequently the likeness of the Divine essence impressed on our intellect will be according to the mode of our intellect, and the mode of our intellect falls short of a perfect reception of the Divine likeness. Now the lack of perfect likeness may occur in as many ways, as unlikeness may occur. For in one way there is a deficient likeness, when the form is participated according to the same specific nature, but not in the same measure of perfection; such is the defective likeness in a subject that has little whiteness in comparison with one that has much. In another way the likeness is yet more defective, when it does not attain to the same specific nature but only to the same generic nature; such is the likeness of an orange-colored or yellowish object in comparison with a white one. In another way, still more defective is the likeness when it does not attain to the same generic nature, but only to a certain analogy or proportion; such is the likeness of whiteness to man, in that each is a being, and in this way every likeness received into a creature is defective in comparison with the Divine essence. Now in order that the sight know whiteness, it is necessary for it to receive the likeness of whiteness according to its specific nature, although not according to the same manner of being, because the form has a manner of being in the sense other from that which it has in the thing outside the soul; for if the form of yellowness were received into the eye, the eye would not be said to see whiteness. In like manner in order that the intellect understand a quiddity, it is necessary for it to receive its likeness according to the same specific nature, although there may possibly not be the same manner of being on either side; for the form which is in the intellect or sense is not the principle of knowledge according to its manner of being on both sides, but according

4 Tr. III, chap. 8 (82va).

### SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 92 ART. 1 1029

to the aspect which it shares with the thing outside. Hence it is clear that by no likeness received in the created intellect can God be understood, in such a way that His essence is seen immediately. And for this reason those who held the Divine essence to be seen in this way alone said that the essence itself will not be seen, but a certain brightness, as it were a radiance of it. Consequently neither does this way suffice for the Divine vision that we seek.

Therefore we must take the other way, which also certain philosophers held, namely Alexander1 and Averroes (*De Anima*, III).2 For since in every knowledge some form is required by which the object is known or seen, this form by which the intellect is perfected so as to see separate substances is neither a quiddity abstracted by the intellect from composite things, as the first opinion maintained, nor an impression left on our intellect by the separate substance, as the second opinion affirmed, but the

1 Alexander of Aphrodisias, *De Intellectu*.
2 Averroes, *In De Anima*, III.

separate substance itself united to our intellect as its form, so as to be both that which is understood, and that by which it is understood. And whatever may be the case with other separate substances, we must nevertheless allow this to be our way of seeing God in His essence, because by whatever other form our intellect were informed, it could not be led thereby to the Divine essence. This, however, must not be understood as though the Divine essence were in reality the form of our intellect, or as though from it and our intellect there resulted one being absolutely, as in natural things from the natural form and matter, but the meaning is that the proportion of the Divine essence to our intellect is as the proportion of form to matter. For whenever two things, one of which is the perfection of the other, are received into the same recipient, the proportion of one to the other, namely of the more perfect to the less perfect, is as the proportion of form to matter; thus light and colour are received into a transparent thing, light being to colour as form to matter. When therefore intellectual light is received into the soul, together with the indwelling Divine essence, though they are not received in the same way, the Divine essence will be to the intellect as form to matter. And that this suffices for the intellect to be able to see the Divine essence by the Divine essence itself may be shown as follows.

As from the natural form (by which a thing has being) and matter there results one thing absolutely, so from the form by which the intellect understands, and the intellect itself, there results one thing in understanding. Now in natural things a self-subsistent thing cannot be the form of any matter if that thing has matter as one of its parts, since it is impossible for matter to be the form of a thing. But if this self-subsistent thing be a form only, nothing hinders it from being the form of some matter and becoming that by which the composite itself is, [^3] as appears in the case of the soul. Now in the intellect we must take the intellect itself in potency as matter, and the intelligible species as form; so that the intellect actually understanding will be the composite as it were resulting from both. Hence if there is a self-subsistent thing that has nothing in itself besides that which is intelligible, such a thing can by itself be the form by which the intellect understands. Now a thing is intelligible in respect of its actuality and not of its potency. [^4] The sign of this is that an intelligible form needs to be abstracted from matter and from all the properties of matter. Therefore, since the Divine essence is pure act, it will be possible for it to be the form by which the intellect understands; and this will be the beatific vision. Hence the Master says (*II Sent.* d. 1) [^5] that the union of the body with the soul is an illustration of the blessed union of the spirit with God.

### Reply Obj. 1.
The words quoted can be explained in three ways, according to Augustine (*De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii*, 6). [^6] In one way as excluding corporeal vision, whereby no one ever saw or will see God in His essence; secondly, as excluding intellectual vision of God in His essence from those who dwell in this mortal flesh; thirdly, as excluding the vision of comprehension from a created intellect. It is thus that Chrysostom understands the saying, and therefore he adds: “By seeing, the evangelist means a most clear perception, and such a comprehension as the Father has of the Son.” This also is the meaning of the evangelist, since he adds: *The only-begotten Son Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him*; his intention being to prove the Son to be God from His comprehending God.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Just as God, by His infinite essence, surpasses all existing things which have a determinate being, so His knowledge, whereby He knows, is above all knowledge. Therefore as our knowledge is to our created essence, so is the Divine knowledge to His infinite essence. Now two things contribute to knowledge, namely, the knower and the thing known. Again, the vision by which we shall see God in His essence is the same by which God sees Himself, as regards that by which He is seen, because as He sees Himself in His essence, so shall we also see Him. But as regards the knower there is the difference that is between the Divine intellect and ours. Now in the order of knowledge the object known follows the form by which we know, since by the form of a stone we see a stone, but the efficacy of knowledge follows the power of the knower; thus he who has stronger sight sees more clearly. Consequently in that vision we shall see the same thing that God sees, namely His essence, but not so effectively.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Dionysius is speaking there of the knowledge whereby wayfarers know God by a created form, by which our intellect is informed so as to see God. But as Augustine says [^7] “God evades every form of our intellect,” because whatever form our intellect conceives, that form is out of proportion to the Divine essence. Hence He cannot be fathomed by our intellect, but our most perfect knowledge of Him as wayfarers is to know that He is above all that our intellect can conceive, and thus we are united to Him as to something unknown. In heaven, however, we shall see Him by a form which is His essence, and we shall be united to Him as to something known.

### Reply Obj. 4.
God is light (John 1:9). Now illumination is the impression of light on an illuminated object. And since the Divine essence is of a different mode from any likeness of it impressed on the intellect, he (Dionysius) says that the “Divine darkness is impervious to all illumination,” because, that is, the Divine essence, which he calls darkness on account of its surpassing brightness, remains undemonstrated by the impression of our intellect, and consequently is hidden from all knowledge. Therefore if anyone in seeing God conceives something in his mind, this is not God but one of God’s effects.

### Reply Obj. 5.
Although the glory of God surpasses any form by which our intellect is informed now, it does not surpass the Divine essence, which will be the form of our intellect in heaven. And therefore although it is invisible now, it will be visible then.

### Reply Obj. 6.
Although there can be no proportion between finite and infinite, since the excess of the infinite over the finite is indeterminate, there can be proportionateness or a likeness to proportion between them, for just as a finite thing is equal to some finite thing, so is an infinite thing equal to an infinite thing. Now in order that a thing be known totally, it is sometimes necessary that there be proportion between knower and known, because the power of the knower needs to be adequate to the knowableness of the thing known, and equality is a kind of proportion. Sometimes, however, the knowableness of the thing surpasses the power of the knower, as when we know God, or conversely when He knows creatures, and then there is no need for proportion between knower and known, but only for proportionateness, so that, namely, as the knower is to the knowable object, so is the knowable object to the fact of its being known; and this proportionateness suffices for the infinite to be known by the finite, or conversely.

We may also reply that proportion according to the strict sense in which it is employed signifies a relationship of quantity to quantity based on a certain fixed excess or equality, but is further transferred to denote any relationship of any one thing to another; and in this sense we say that matter should be proportionate to its form. In this sense nothing hinders our intellect, although finite, being described as proportionate to the vision of the Divine essence; but not to the comprehension of it, on account of its immensity.

### Reply Obj. 7.
Likeness and distance are twofold. One is according to agreement in nature; and thus God is more distant from the created intellect than the created intelligible is from the sense. The other is according to proportionateness; and thus it is the other way about, for sense is not proportionate to the knowledge of the immaterial, as the intellect is proportionate to the knowledge of anything immaterial whatsoever. It is this likeness and not the former that is required for knowledge, for it is clear that the intellect understanding a stone is not like it in its natural being; thus also the sight apprehends red honey and red gall, though it does not apprehend sweet honey, for the redness of gall is more becoming to honey as visible, than the sweetness of honey to honey.

### Reply Obj. 8.
In the vision wherein God will be seen in His essence, the Divine essence itself will be the form, as it were, of the intellect, by which it will understand; nor is it necessary for them to become one in being, but only to become one as regards the act of understanding.

### Reply Obj. 9.
We do not uphold the saying of Avicenna as regards the point at issue, for in this other philosophers also disagree with him. Unless perhaps we might say that Avicenna refers to the knowledge of separate substances, in so far as they are known by the habits of speculative sciences and the likeness of other things. Hence he makes this statement in order to prove that in us knowledge is not a substance but an accident. Nevertheless, although the Divine essence is more distant as to the property of its nature from our intellect than is the substance of an angel, it surpasses it in the point of intelligibility, since it is pure act without any admixture of potency, which is not the case with other separate substances. Nor will that knowledge by which we shall see God in His essence be in the genus of accident as regards that by which He will be seen, but only as regards the act of the one who understands Him, for this act will not be the very substance either of the person understanding or of the thing understood.

### Reply Obj. 10.
A substance that is separate from matter understands both itself and other things, and in both cases the authority quoted can be verified. For since the very essence of a separate substance is of itself intelligible and actual, through being separate from matter, it is clear that when a separate substance understands itself, that which understands and that which is understood are absolutely identical, for it does not understand itself by an intention abstracted from itself, as we understand material objects. And this is apparently the meaning of the Philosopher [^8] as indicated by the Commentator. [^9]

But when it understands other things, the thing actually understood becomes one with the intellect in act, in so far as the form of the thing understood becomes the form of the intellect, in so far as the intellect is in act; not that it becomes identified with the essence of the intellect, as Avicenna proves (*De Natural.* VI), [^10] because the essence of the intellect remains one under two forms whereby it understands two things in succession, in the same way as primary matter remains one under various forms. Hence also the Commentator (*De Anima*, III) [^11] compares the possible intellect, in this respect, to primary matter. Thus it by no means follows that our intellect in seeing God becomes the very essence of God, but that the latter is compared to it as its perfection or form.

### Reply Obj. 11.
These and all like authorities must be understood to refer to the knowledge by which we know God on the way, for the reason given above.

### Reply Obj. 12.
The infinite is unknown if we take it in the privative sense, as such, because it indicates removal of completion, from which knowledge of a thing is derived. Therefore the infinite amounts to the same as matter subject to privation, as stated in the *Physics*. [^12] But if we take the infinite in the negative sense, it indicates the absence of limiting matter, since even a form is in some way limited by its matter. Hence the infinite in this sense is of itself most knowable; and it is in this way that God is infinite.

### Reply Obj. 13.
Augustine is speaking of bodily vision, by which God will never be seen. This is evident from what precedes:
> For no man hath seen God at any time, nor can any man see Him as these things which we call visible are seen; in this way He is by nature invisible even as He is incorruptible.
As, however, He is by nature supremely being, so He is in Himself supremely intelligible. But that He is for a time not understood by us is owing to our defect; therefore that He is seen by us after being unseen is owing to a change not in Him but in us.

### Reply Obj. 14.
In heaven God will be seen by the saints as He is, if this be referred to the mode of the object seen, for the saints will see that God has the mode which He has. But if we refer the mode to the knower, He will not be seen as He is, because the created intellect will not have so great an efficacy in seeing as the Divine essence has to the effect of being seen.

### Reply Obj. 15.
There is a threefold medium both in bodily and in intellectual vision. The first is the medium under which the object is seen, and this is something perfecting the sight so as to see in general, without determining the sight to any particular object. Such is bodily light in relation to bodily vision; and the light of the agent intellect in relation to the possible intellect, in so far as this light is a medium. The second is the light by which the object is seen, and this is the visible form, by which either sight is determined to a special object, for instance by the form of a stone to know a stone. The third is the medium in which it is seen, and this is something by gazing on which the sight is led to something else; thus by looking in a mirror it is led to see the things reflected in the mirror, and by looking at an image it is led to the thing represented by the image. In this way, too, the intellect from knowing an effect is led to the cause, or conversely. Accordingly in the heavenly vision there will be no third medium, so that, namely, God be known by the images of other things, as He is known now, for which reason we are said to see now in a glass; nor will there be the second medium, because the essence itself of God will be that whereby our intellect will see God. But there will only be the first medium, which will upraise our intellect so that it will be possible for it to be united to the uncreated substance in the aforesaid manner. Yet this medium will not cause that knowledge to be mediate, because it does not come in between the knower and the thing known, but is that which gives the knower the power to know.

### Reply Obj. 16.
Corporeal creatures are not said to be seen immediately, except when that which in them is capable of being brought into conjunction with the sight is in conjunction with it. Now they are not capable of being in conjunction with the sight by their essence on account of their materiality; hence they are seen immediately when their image is in conjunction with the sight. But God is able to be united to the intellect by His Essence; therefore He would not be seen immediately unless His essence were united to the intellect; and this vision, which is effected immediately, is called vision of face. Moreover the likeness of the corporeal thing is received into the sight according to the same aspect as it is in the thing, although not according to the same mode of being. Therefore this likeness leads to the thing directly; but no likeness can lead our intellect in this way to God, as shown above. And for this reason the comparison fails.

## Article 2. Whether After the Resurrection the Saints Will See God With the Eyes of the Body?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that after the resurrection the saints will see God with the eyes of the body.

### Objection 1.
Because the glorified eye has greater power than one that is not glorified. Now the blessed Job saw God with his eyes (Job 42:5): *With the hearing of the ear, I have heard Thee, but now my eye seeth Thee*. Much more therefore will the glorified eye be able to see God in His essence.

### Obj. 2.
Further, It is written (Job 19:26): *In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour* (Vulg., *my God*). Therefore in heaven God will be seen with the eyes of the body.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Augustine, speaking of the sight of the glorified eyes, expresses himself as follows: [^13]
> A greater power will be in those eyes, not to see more keenly, as certain serpents or eagles are reported to see (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by these animals they can see only corporeal things), but to see even incorporeal things.
Now any power that is capable of knowing incorporeal things can be upraised to see God. Therefore the glorified eyes will be able to see God.

### Obj. 4.
Further, The disparity of corporeal to incorporeal things is the same as of incorporeal to corporeal. Now the incorporeal eye can see corporeal things. Therefore the corporeal eye can see the incorporeal. And consequently the same conclusion follows.

### Obj. 5.
Further, Gregory, commenting on Job 4:16, *There stood one whose countenance I knew not*, says (*Moralia*, V, 34): [^14]
> Man who had he been willing to obey the command, would have been spiritual in the flesh, became, by sinning, carnal even in mind.
Now through becoming carnal in mind, “he thinks only of those things which he draws to his soul by the images of bodies” (*ibid.*). Therefore when he will be spiritual in the flesh (which is promised to the saints after the resurrection), he will be able even in the flesh to see spiritual things. Therefore the same conclusion follows.

### Obj. 6.
Further, Man can be beatified by God alone. Now he will be beatified not only in soul but also in body. Therefore God will be visible not only to his intellect but also to his flesh.

### Obj. 7.
Further, Even as God is present to the intellect by His essence, so will He be to the senses, because He will be all in all (1 Cor. 15:28). Now He will be seen by the intellect through the union of His essence with the intellect. Therefore He will also be visible to the sense.

### On the contrary,
Ambrose, commenting on Luke 1:11, *There appeared to him an angel*, says: [^15] “God is not sought with the eyes of the body, nor surveyed by the sight, nor clasped by the touch.” Therefore God will by no means be visible to the bodily sense.

### Further,
Jerome, commenting on Isa. 6:1, *I saw the Lord sitting*, says: [^16] “The Godhead not only of the Father, but also of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is visible, not to carnal eyes, but only to the eyes of the mind, of which it is said: ‘Blessed are the pure in heart.’ ”

### Further,
Jerome says again (as quoted by Augustine, *Ep. cxlvii*, 23): [^17] “An incorporeal thing is invisible to a corporeal eye.” But God is supremely incorporeal. Therefore, etc.

### Further,
Augustine says (*De Videndo Deo, Ep. cxlvii*, 11): [^18] “No man hath seen God as He is at any time, neither in this life, nor in the angelic life, in the same way as these visible things which are seen with the corporeal sight.” Now the angelic life is the life of the blessed, wherein they will live after the resurrection. Therefore, etc.

### Further,
According to Augustine (*De Trinitate*, XIV, 4), [^19] “man is said to be made to God's image in that he is able to see God.” But man is in God’s image as regards his mind, and not as regards his flesh. Therefore he will see God with his mind and not with his flesh.

### I answer that,
A thing is perceived by the senses of the body in two ways, directly and indirectly. A thing is perceived directly if it can act directly on the bodily senses. And a thing can act directly either on sense as such or on a particular sense as such. That which acts directly in this second way on a sense is called a proper sensible, for instance colour in relation to the sight, and sound in relation to the hearing. But as sense as such makes use of a bodily organ, nothing can be received therein except corporeally, since whatever is received into a thing is in it after the mode of the recipient. Hence all sensibles act on the sense as such, according to their magnitude, and consequently magnitude and all that follows on it, such as movement, rest, number, and the like, are called common sensibles, and yet they are direct objects of sense.

An indirect object of sense is that which does not act on the sense, neither as sense nor as a particular sense, but is joined to those things that act on sense directly; for instance Socrates, the son of Diares, a friend, and the like which are known *per se* by the intellect in the universal, and in the particular are the object of the cogitative power in man, and of the estimative power in other animals. The external sense is said to perceive things of this kind, although *per accidens*, when the apprehensive power (whose province it is to know *per se* this thing known), from that which is sensed *per se*, apprehends them at once and without any doubt or discourse (thus we see that a person is alive from the fact that he speaks). Otherwise the sense is not said to perceive it even accidentally.

I say then that God can in no way be seen with the eyes of the body, or perceived by any of the senses, as that which is seen *per se*, neither here, nor in heaven; for if that which belongs to sense as such be removed from sense, there will be no sense, and in like manner if that which belongs to sight as sight be removed from sight, there will be no sight. Accordingly seeing that sense as sense perceives magnitude, and sight as such a sense perceives colour, it is impossible for the sight to perceive that which is neither colour nor magnitude, unless we call it a sense equivocally. Since then sight and sense will be specifically the same in the glorified body as in a non-glorified body, it will be impossible for it to see the Divine essence as a thing *per se* visible; yet it will see it as is visible *per accidens*, because on the one hand the bodily sight will see so great a glory of God in bodies, especially in the glorified bodies and most of all in the body of Christ, and, on the other hand, the intellect will see God so clearly, that God will be perceived in things seen with the eye of the body, even as life is perceived in speech. For although our intellect will not then see God from seeing His creatures, yet it will see God in His creatures seen corporeally. This manner of seeing God corporeally is indicated by Augustine, [^20] as is clear if we take note of his words, for he says:
> It is very credible that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the new heaven and the new earth, as to see most clearly God everywhere present, governing all corporeal things, not as we now see the invisible things of God as understood by those that are made, but as when we see men . . . we do not believe but see that they live.

### Reply Obj. 1.
This saying of Job refers to the spiritual eye, of which the Apostle says (Eph. 1:18): *The eyes of our (Vulg., your) heart enlightened*.

### Reply Obj. 2.
The passage quoted does not mean that we are to see God with the eyes of the flesh, but that, in the flesh, we shall see God.

### Reply Obj. 3.
In these words Augustine speaks as one inquiring and conditionally. This appears from what he had said before: “Therefore they will have an altogether different power, if they shall see that incorporeal nature”; and then he goes on to say: “Accordingly a greater power,” etc., and afterwards he explains himself.

### Reply Obj. 4.
All knowledge results from some kind of abstraction from matter. Therefore the more a corporeal form is abstracted from matter, the more is it a principle of knowledge. Hence it is that a form existing in matter is in no way a principle of knowledge, while a form existing in the senses is somewhat a principle of knowledge, in so far as it is separated from matter, and a form existing in the intellect is still better a principle of knowledge. Therefore the spiritual eye, from which the obstacle to knowledge is removed, can see a corporeal object; but it does not follow that the corporeal eye, in which the cognitive power is deficient as participating in matter, is able to know perfectly incorporeal objects of knowledge.

### Reply Obj. 5.
Although the mind that has become carnal cannot think but of things received from the senses, it thinks of them immaterially. In like manner whatever the sight apprehends, it must always apprehend it corporeally; therefore it cannot know things which cannot be apprehended corporeally.

### Reply Obj. 6.
Happiness is the perfection of man as man. And since man is man not through his body but through his soul, and the body is essential to man, in so far as it is perfected by the soul, it follows that man’s happiness does not chiefly consist other than in an act of the soul, and passes from the soul on to the body by a kind of overflow, as explained above (Q. LXXXV, A. 1). Yet our body will have a certain Happiness from seeing God in sensible creatures, and especially in Christ’s body.

### Reply Obj. 7.
The intellect can perceive spiritual things, whereas the eyes of the body cannot; therefore the intellect will be able to know the Divine essence united to it, but the eyes of the body will not.

## Article 3. Whether the Saints, Seeing God, See All That God Sees?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the saints, seeing God in His essence, see all that God sees in Himself.

### Objection 1.
For as Isidore says: [^21] “The angels know all things in the Word of God, before they happen.” Now the saints will be equal to the angels of God (Matt. 22:30).

Therefore the saints also in seeing God see all things.

Obj. 2. Further, Gregory says (*Dialogues*, iv, 33):^2 “Since all see God there with equal clearness, what do they not know, who know Him Who knows all things?,” and he refers to the blessed who see God in His essence. Therefore those who see God in His essence know all things.

Obj. 3. Further, It is stated in the book on the *Soul*^3 that “when an intellect understands the greatest things, it is all the more able to understand the least things.” Now God is the greatest of intelligible things. Therefore the power of the intellect is greatly increased by understanding Him. Therefore the intellect seeing Him understands all things.

Obj. 4. Further, The intellect is not hindered from understanding a thing except by this surpassing it. Now no creature surpasses the intellect that understands God, since, as Gregory says (*Dialogues*, ii, 35):^4 “to the soul which sees its Creator all creatures are small.” Therefore those who see God in His essence know all things.

Obj. 5. Further, Every passive power that is not reduced to act is imperfect. Now the possible intellect of the human soul is a power that is passive as it were to the knowledge of all things, since “the possible intellect is in which all are in potentiality.”^5 If then in that happiness it were not to understand all things, it would remain imperfect, which is absurd.

Obj. 6. Further, Whoever sees a mirror sees the things reflected in the mirror. Now all things are reflected in the Word of God as in a mirror, because He is the type and likeness of all. Therefore the saints who see the Word in His essence see all created things.

Obj. 7. Further, According to Proverbs 10:24, *to the just their desire shall be given*. Now the just desire to know all things, since all men desire naturally to know, and nature is not done away by glory. Therefore God will grant them to know all things.

Obj. 8. Further, Ignorance is one of the penalties of the present life. Now all penalty will be removed from the saints by glory. Therefore all ignorance will be removed, and consequently they will know all things.

Obj. 9. Further, The happiness of the saints is in their soul before being in their body. Now the bodies of the saints will be reformed in glory to the likeness of Christ’s body (Philippians 3:21). Therefore their souls will be perfected in likeness to the soul of Christ. Now Christ’s soul sees all things in the Word. Therefore all the souls of the saints will also see all things in the Word.

Obj. 10. Further, The intellect, like the senses, knows all the things with the likeness of which it is informed. Now the Divine essence shows a thing forth more clearly than any other likeness of it. Therefore since in that blessed vision the Divine essence becomes the form as it were of our intellect, it would seem that the saints seeing God see all.

Obj. 11. Further, The Commentator says (*De Anima*, iii):^1 “if the agent intellect were the form of the possible intellect, we should understand all things.” Now the Divine essence represents all things more clearly than the agent intellect. Therefore the intellect that sees God in His essence knows all things.

Obj. 12. Further, The lower angels are enlightened by the higher about the things they are ignorant of, for the reason that they do not now know all things. Now after the day of judgment, one angel will not enlighten another, for then all superiority will cease, as a gloss observes^2 on 1 Corinthians 15:24, *When He shall have brought to nought*, etc. Therefore the lower angels will then know all things, and for the same reason all the other saints who will see God in His essence.

SUPPLEMENT TO THIRD PART Q. 92 ART. 3 1035

On the contrary, Dionysius says (*Cel. Hier.* vi, 2):^3 “The higher angels cleanse the lower angels from ignorance.” Now the lower angels see the Divine essence. Therefore an angel while seeing the Divine essence may be ignorant of certain things. But the soul will not see God more perfectly than an angel. Therefore the souls seeing God will not necessarily see all things.

Further, Christ alone has the spirit not by measure (John 3:34). Now it becomes Christ, as having the spirit without measure, to know all things in the Word; therefore it is stated in the same place (verse 35) that *the Father . . . hath given all things into His hand*. Therefore none but Christ is able to know all things in the Word.

Further, The more perfectly a principle is known, the more of its effects are known thereby. Now some of those who see God in His essence will know God more perfectly than others. Therefore some will know more things than others, and consequently every one will not know all things.

I answer that, God, by seeing His essence, knows all things whatsoever that are, shall be, or have been; and He is said to know these things by His knowledge of vision, because He knows them as though they were present in likeness to corporeal vision. Moreover by seeing this essence He knows all that He can do, although He never did them, nor ever will, for otherwise He would not know His power perfectly, since a power cannot be known unless its objects be known; and this is called His science or knowledge of simple intelligence.

Now it is impossible for a created intellect, by seeing the Divine essence, to know all that God can do, because the more perfectly a principle is known, the more things are known in it; thus in one principle of demonstration one who is quick of intelligence sees more conclusions than one who is slow of intelligence. Since, then, the extent of the Divine power is measured according to what it can do, if an intellect were to see in the Divine essence all that God can do, its perfection in understanding would equal in extent the Divine power in producing its effects, and thus it would comprehend the Divine power, which is impossible for any created intellect to do.

Yet there is a created intellect, namely the soul of Christ, which knows in the Word all that God knows by the knowledge of vision. But regarding others who see the Divine essence there are two opinions. For some say that all who see God in His essence see all that God sees by His knowledge of vision. This, however, is contrary to the sayings of holy men,^4 who hold that angels are ignorant of some things; and yet it is clear that according to faith all the angels see God in His essence. Therefore others say that others than Christ, although they see God in His essence, do not see all that God sees because they do not comprehend the Divine essence. For it is not necessary that he who knows a cause should know all its effects, unless he comprehend the cause, and a created intellect is not able to do this. Consequently of those who see God in His essence, each one sees in His essence so much the more things according as he sees the Divine essence the more clearly, and hence it is that one is able to instruct another concerning these things. Thus the knowledge of the angels and of the souls of the saints can go on increasing until the day of judgment, even as other things pertaining to the accidental reward. But afterwards it will increase no more, because then will be the final state of things, and in that state it is possible that all will know everything that God knows by the knowledge of vision.

Reply Obj. 1. The saying of Isidore, that “the angels know in the Word all things before they happen,” cannot refer to those things which God knows only by the knowledge of simple intelligence, because those things will never happen, but it must refer to those things which God knows only by the knowledge of vision. Even of these he does not say that all the angels know them all, but that perhaps some do, and that even those who know do not know all perfectly. For in one and the same thing there are many intelligible aspects to be considered, such as its various properties and relations to other things, and it is possible that while one thing is known in common by two persons, one of them perceives more aspects, and that the one learns these aspects from the other. Hence Dionysius says (*Div. Nom.* IV):^1 that “the lower angels learn from the higher angels the intelligible aspects of things.” Therefore it does not follow that even the angels who know all creatures are able to see all that can be understood in them.

Reply Obj. 2. It follows from this saying of Gregory that this blessed vision suffices for the seeing of all things on the part of the Divine essence, which is the medium by which one sees, and by which God sees all things. That all things, however, are not seen is owing to the deficiency of the created intellect which does not comprehend the Divine essence.

Reply Obj. 3. The created intellect sees the Divine essence not according to the mode of that same essence, but according to its own mode which is finite. Hence its efficacy in knowing would need to be infinitely increased by reason of that vision in order for it to know all things.

Reply Obj. 4. Defective knowledge results not only from excess and deficiency of the knowable thing in relation to the intellect, but also from the fact that the aspect of knowableness is not united to the intellect; thus sometimes the sight does not see a stone, through the likeness of the stone not being united to it. And although the Divine essence which is the type of all things is united to the intellect of one who sees God, it is united to it not as the type of all things, but as the type of some and of so much the more according as one sees the Divine essence more fully.

Reply Obj. 5. When a passive power is perfectible by several perfections in order, if it is perfected with its ultimate perfection it is not said to be imperfect, even though it lack some of the preceding dispositions. Now all knowledge by which the created intellect is perfected is ordered to the knowledge of God as its end. Therefore he who sees God in His essence, even though he know nothing else, would have a perfect intellect; nor is his intellect more perfect through knowing something else besides Him, except in so far as it sees Him more fully. Hence Augustine says:^2 “Unhappy is he who knoweth all these (namely, creatures), and knoweth not Thee; but happy whoso knoweth Thee, though he know not these. And whoso knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them, but for Thee only.”

Reply Obj. 6. This mirror has a will, and even as He will show Himself to whom He will, so will He show in Himself whatsoever He will. Nor does the comparison with a material mirror hold, for it is not in its power to be seen or not to be seen.

We may also reply that in a material mirror both thing and mirror are seen under their proper form; although the mirror is seen through a form received from the thing itself, whereas the stone is seen through its proper form reflected in some other thing, where the reason for seeing the one is the reason for seeing the other. But in the uncreated mirror a thing is seen through the form of the mirror, just as an effect is seen through the likeness of its cause and conversely. Consequently it does not follow that whoever sees the eternal mirror sees all that is reflected in that mirror, since he who sees the cause does not of necessity see all its effects, unless he comprehend the cause.

Reply Obj. 7. The desire of the saints to know all things will be fulfilled by the mere fact of their seeing God, just as their desire to possess all good things will be fulfilled by their possessing God. For as God suffices the affections in that He has perfect goodness, and by possessing Him we possess all goods as it were, so does the vision of Him suffice the intellect: *Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us* (John 14:8).

Reply Obj. 8. Ignorance properly so called denotes a privation and thus is it a punishment; for in this way ignorance is nescience of things, the knowledge of which is a duty or a necessity. Now the saints in heaven will not be ignorant of any of these things. Sometimes, however, ignorance is taken in a broad sense of any kind of nescience, and thus the angels and saints in heaven will be ignorant of certain things. Hence Dionysius says (*loc. cit.*) that “the angels will be cleansed from their *ignorance (nescientia)*.” In this sense ignorance is not a penalty but a defect. Nor is it necessary for all such defects to be done away by glory, for thus we might say that it was a defect in Pope Linus that he did not attain to the glory of Peter.

Reply Obj. 9. Our body will be conformed to the body of Christ in glory, in likeness but not in equality, for it will be endowed with clarity even as Christ’s body, but not equally. In like manner our soul will have glory in likeness to the soul of Christ, but not in equality thereto; thus it will have knowledge even as Christ’s soul, but not so great, so as to know all as Christ’s soul does.

Reply Obj. 10. Although the Divine essence is the type of all things knowable, it will not be united to each created intellect according as it is the type of all. Hence the objection proves nothing.

Reply Obj. 11. The agent intellect is a form proportionate to the possible intellect; even as the potency of matter is proportionate to the power of the natural agent, so that whatsoever is in the passive power of matter or of the possible intellect is in the active power of the agent intellect or of the natural agent. Consequently if the agent intellect become the form of the possible intellect, the latter must of necessity know all those things to which the power of the agent intellect extends. But the Divine essence is not a form proportionate to our intellect in this sense. Hence the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 12. Nothing hinders us from saying that after the judgment day, when the glory of men and angels will be consummated once for all, all the blessed will know all that God knows by the knowledge of vision, yet so that not all will see all in the Divine essence. Christ’s soul, however, will see clearly all things therein, even as it sees them now, while others will see therein a greater or lesser number of things according to the degree of clearness with which they will know God, and thus Christ’s soul will enlighten all other souls concerning those things which it sees in the Word better than others. Hence it is written (Revelation 21:23): *The glory of God shall enlighten the city of Jerusalem (Vulg., — hath enlightened it), and the Lamb is the lamp thereof*. In like manner the higher souls will enlighten the lower (not indeed with a new enlightening, so as to increase the knowledge of the lower), but with a kind of continued enlightenment; thus we might understand the sun to enlighten the atmosphere while at a standstill. Therefore it is written (Daniel 12:3): *They that instruct many to justice shall shine as stars for all eternity*. The statement that the superiority of the orders will cease refers to their present ordered ministry in our regard, as is clear from the same gloss.

# QUESTION XCIII
## Of the Happiness of the Saints and Their Mansions
### (In Three Articles)

We must next consider the happiness of the saints and their mansions. Under this head there are three points of inquiry: (1) Whether the happiness of the saints will increase after the judgment? (2) Whether the degrees of happiness should be called mansions? (3) Whether the various mansions differ according to various degrees of charity?

## Article 1. Whether the Happiness of the Saints Will Be Greater After the Judgment Than Before?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the happiness of the saints will not be greater after the judgment than before.

Objection 1. For the nearer a thing approaches to the Divine likeness, the more perfectly does it participate happiness. Now the soul is more like God when separated from the body than when united to it. Therefore its happiness is greater before being reunited to the body than after.

Obj. 2. Further, Power is more effective when it is united than when divided. Now the soul is more united when separated from the body than when it is joined to the body. Therefore it has then greater power for operation, and consequently has a more perfect share of happiness, since this consists in an act.

Obj. 3. Further, Happiness consists in an act of the speculative intellect. Now the intellect, in its act, makes no use of a bodily organ, and consequently by being reunited to the body the soul does not become capable of more perfect understanding. Therefore the soul’s happiness is not greater after than before the judgment.

Obj. 4. Further, Nothing can be greater than the infinite, and so the addition of the finite to the infinite does not result in something greater than the infinite by itself. Now the beatified soul before its reunion with the body is rendered happy by rejoicing in the infinite good, namely God; and after the resurrection of the body it will rejoice in nothing else except perhaps the glory of the body, and this is a finite good. Therefore their joy after the resumption of the body will not be greater than before.

On the contrary, A gloss on Revelation 6:9, *I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain*, says:^1 “At present the souls of the saints are under the altar, that is, less exalted than they will be.” Therefore their happiness will be greater after the resurrection than after their death.

Further, Just as happiness is bestowed on the good as a reward, so is unhappiness awarded to the wicked. But the unhappiness of the wicked after reunion with their bodies will be greater than before, since they will be punished not only in the soul but also in the body. Therefore the happiness of the saints will be greater after the resurrection of the body than before.

I answer that, It is manifest that the happiness of the saints will increase in extent after the resurrection, because their happiness will then be not only in the soul but also in the body. Moreover, the soul’s happiness also will increase in extent, seeing that the soul will rejoice not only in its own good, but also in that of the body. We may also say that the soul’s happiness will increase in intensity.^2 For man’s body may be considered in two ways: first, as being dependent on the soul for its completion; secondly, as containing something that hampers the soul in its operations, through the soul not perfectly completing the body. As regards the first way of considering the body, its union with the soul adds a certain perfection to the soul, since every part is imperfect, and is completed in its whole; therefore the whole is to the part as form to matter. Consequently the soul is more perfect in its natural being, when it is in the whole — namely, man who results from the union of soul and body — than when it is a separate part. But as regards the second consideration the union of the body hampers the perfection of the soul, and so it is written (Wisdom 9:15) that *the corruptible body is a load upon the soul*. If, then, there be removed from the body all those things by which it hampers the soul’s action, the soul will be more perfect absolutely while existing in such a body than when separated from it. Now the more perfect a thing is in being, the more perfectly is it able to operate; therefore the operation of the soul united to such a body will be more perfect than the operation of the separated soul. But the glorified body will be a body of this description, being altogether subject to the spirit. Therefore, since happiness consists in an operation, the soul’s happiness after its reunion with the body will be more perfect than before. For just as the soul separated from a corruptible body is able to operate more perfectly than when united to it, so after it has been united to a glorified body, its operation will be more perfect than while it was separated. Now every imperfect thing desires its perfection. Hence the separated soul naturally desires reunion with the body, and on account of this desire which proceeds from the soul’s imperfection, its operation by which it is borne towards God is less intense. This agrees with the saying of Augustine (*Gen. ad Lit.* XII, 35)^3 that “on account of the body’s desire it is held back from tending with all its might to that sovereign good.”

Reply Obj. 1. The soul united to a glorified body is more like to God than when separated from it, in so far as when united it has more perfect being. For the more perfect a thing is the more it is like to God; even so the heart, the perfection of whose life consists in movement, is more like to God while in movement than while at rest, although God is never moved.

Reply Obj. 2. A power which by its own nature is capable of being in matter is more effective when it is in matter than when separated from matter, although absolutely speaking a power separate from matter is more powerful.

Reply Obj. 3. Although in the act of understanding the soul does not make use of the body, the perfection of the body will in some way conduce to the perfection of the intellectual operation in so far as through being united to a glorified body the soul will be more perfect in its nature, and consequently more effective in its operation, and accordingly the good itself of the body will conduce instrumentally, as it were, to the operation wherein happiness consists; thus the Philosopher asserts^1 that external goods conduce instrumentally to the happiness of life.

Reply Obj. 4. Although finite added to infinite does not make a greater thing, it makes more things, since finite and infinite are two things, while infinite taken by itself is one. Now the greater extent of joy regards not a greater thing but more things. Therefore joy is increased in extent, through referring to God and to the body’s glory, in comparison with the joy which referred to God. Moreover, the body’s glory will conduce to the intensity of the joy that refers to God, in so far as it will conduce to the more perfect operation whereby the soul tends to God, since the more perfect is a becoming operation, the greater the delight, as stated in the *Ethics*.^2

^2 *Ibid.*, X, 4 (1174b19).

## Article 2. Whether the Degrees of Happiness Should Be Called Mansions?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the degrees of happiness should not be called mansions.

Objection 1. For happiness implies the notion of a reward, whereas mansion denotes nothing pertaining to a reward. Therefore the various degrees of happiness should not be called mansions.

Obj. 2. Further, mansion seems to denote a place. Now the place where the saints will be beatified is not corporeal but spiritual, namely God Who is one. Therefore there is but one mansion, and consequently the various degrees of happiness should not be called mansions.

Obj. 3. Further, As in heaven there will be men of various merits, so are there now in purgatory, and were in the limbo of the fathers. But various mansions are not distinguished in purgatory and limbo. Therefore in like manner neither should they be distinguished in heaven.

On the contrary, It is written (John 14:2): *In My Father’s house there are many mansions*, and Augustine expounds this in reference to the different degrees of rewards (*Tract. lxvii in Joann.*).^3

Further, In every well-ordered city there is a distinction of mansions. Now the heavenly kingdom is compared to a city (Revelation 21:2). Therefore we should distinguish various mansions there according to the various degrees of happiness.

I answer that, Since local movement precedes all other movements, terms of movement, distance and the like are derived from local movement to all other movements according to the Philosopher.^4 Now the end of local movement is a place, and when a thing has arrived at that place it remains there at rest and is maintained in it. Hence in every movement this very rest at the end of the movement is called an establishment (*collocatio*) or mansion. Therefore since the term movement is transferred to the actions of the appetite and will, the attainment of the end of an appetitive movement is called a mansion or establishment, so that the unity of a house corresponds to the unity of happiness, which unity is on the part of the object, and the plurality of mansions corresponds to the differences of happiness on the part of the blessed; even so we observe in natural things that there is one same place above to which all light objects tend, whereas each one reaches it more closely according as it is lighter, so that they have various mansions corresponding to their various lightness.

Reply Obj. 1. Mansion implies the notion of end and consequently of reward which is the end of merit.

Reply Obj. 2. Though there is one spiritual place, there are different degrees of approaching to it, and the various mansions correspond to these.

Reply Obj. 3. Those who were in limbo or are now in purgatory have not yet attained to their end. Therefore various mansions are not distinguished in purgatory or limbo, but only in heaven and hell, wherein is the end of the good and of the wicked.

^3 PL 35, 1812.
^4 Aristotle, *Physics*, VIII, 9 (265b17).

## Article 3. Whether the Various Mansions Are Distinguished According to the Various Degrees of Charity?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the various mansions are not distinguished according to the various degrees of charity.

Objection 1. For it is written (Matthew 25:15): *He gave to every one according to his proper virtue (Douay, — ability)*. Now the proper ability of a thing is its natural power. Therefore the gifts also of grace and glory are distributed according to the different degrees of natural power.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (Psalm 61:12):

Thou wilt render to every man according to his works. Now that which is rendered is the measure of happiness. Therefore the degrees of happiness are distinguished according to the diversity of works and not according to the diversity of charity.

### Objection 3.
Further, Reward is due to act and not to habit; hence it is not the strongest who are crowned but those who engage in the conflict,¹ and he . . . shall not be (Vulg., *is not*) crowned except he strive lawfully. Now happiness is a reward. Therefore the various degrees of happiness will be according to the various degrees of works and not according to the various degrees of charity.

On the contrary, The more one will be united to God the happier will one be. Now the measure of charity is the measure of one's union with God. Therefore the diversity of happiness will be according to the difference of charity.

Further, If one thing follows absolutely from another thing absolutely, the increase of the former follows from the increase of the latter. Now to have happiness follows from having charity. Therefore to have greater happiness follows from having greater charity.

### I answer that,
The distinguishing principle of the mansions or degrees of happiness is twofold, namely, proximate and remote. The proximate principle is the difference of disposition which will be in the blessed, from which will result the difference of perfection in them in respect to the beatific operation, while the remote principle is the merit by which they have obtained that happiness. In the first way the mansions are distinguished according to the charity of heaven, which the more perfect it will be in anyone, the more will it render him capable of the Divine clarity, on the increase of which will depend the increase in perfection of the Divine vision. In the second way the mansions are distinguished according to the charity of the way. For our actions are meritorious not by the very substance of the action, but only by the habit of virtue with which they are informed. Now every virtue obtains its meritorious efficacy from charity, which has the end itself for its object. Hence the diversity of merit is all traced to the diversity of charity, and thus the charity of the way will distinguish the mansions by way of merit.

### Reply Objection 1.
In this passage “virtue” denotes not the natural ability alone, but the natural ability together with the endeavour to obtain grace. Consequently virtue in this sense will be a kind of material disposition to the measure of grace and glory that one will receive. But charity is the formal complement of merit in relation to glory, and therefore the distinction of degrees in glory depends on the degrees of charity rather than on the degrees of the aforesaid virtue.

### Reply Objection 2.
Works in themselves do not demand the payment of a reward, except as informed by charity, and therefore the various degrees of glory will be according to the various degrees of charity.

### Reply Objection 3.
Although the habit of charity or of any virtue whatever is not a merit to which a reward is due, it is none the less the principle and reason of merit in the act, and consequently according to its diversity is the diversity of rewards. This does not prevent our observing a certain degree of merit in the act considered generically, not indeed in relation to the essential reward which is joy in God, but in relation to some accidental reward, which is joy in some created good.

## Question XCIV
### Of the Relations of the Saints Towards the Damned
(In Three Articles)

We must next consider the relations of the saints towards the damned. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
1.  Whether the saints see the sufferings of the damned?
2.  Whether they pity them?
3.  Whether they rejoice in their sufferings?

## Article 1. Whether the Blessed in Heaven Will See the Sufferings of the Damned?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the blessed in heaven will not see the sufferings of the damned.

### Objection 1.
For the damned are more cut off from the blessed than wayfarers. But the blessed do not see the deeds of wayfarers; therefore a gloss on Isa. 63. 16, *Abraham hath not known us*, says:²
> “The dead, even the saints, know not what the living, even their own children, are doing.”
Much less therefore do they see the sufferings of the damned.

### Objection 2.
Further, Perfection of vision depends on the perfection of the visible object; hence the Philosopher says³ that
> “the most perfect operation of the sense of sight is when the sense is most disposed with reference to the most beautiful of the objects which fall under the sight.”
Therefore, on the other hand, any deformity in the visible object redounds to the imperfection of the sight. But there will be no imperfection in the blessed. Therefore they will not see the sufferings of the damned wherein there is extreme deformity.

On the contrary, It is written (Isa. 66. 24): *They shall go out and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me*; and a gloss says:⁴
> “The elect will go out by understanding or seeing manifestly, so that they may be urged the more to praise God.”

### I answer that,
Nothing should be denied the blessed that belongs to the perfection of their happiness. Now everything is known the more for being compared with its contrary, because when contraries are placed beside one another they become more conspicuous. Therefore in order that the happiness of the saints may be more delightful to them and that they may render more copious thanks to God for it, they are allowed to see perfectly the sufferings of the damned.

### Reply Objection 1.
This gloss speaks of what the departed saints are able to do by nature, for it is not necessary that they should know by natural knowledge all that happens to the living. But the saints in heaven know distinctly all that happens both to wayfarers and to the damned. Hence Gregory says (*Moral*, XII, 21)⁵ that Job's words (Job 14. 21), *“Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand,”*
> “do not apply to the souls of the saints, because since they possess the glory of God within them, we cannot believe that external things are unknown to them.”

### Reply Objection 2.
Although the beauty of the thing seen conduces to the perfection of vision, there may be deformity of the thing seen without imperfection of vision, because the species of things by which the soul knows contraries are not themselves contrary. Therefore also God, who has most perfect knowledge, sees all things, beautiful and deformed.

## Article 2. Whether the Blessed Pity the Unhappiness of the Damned?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the blessed pity the unhappiness of the damned.

### Objection 1.
For pity proceeds from charity, and charity will be most perfect in the blessed. Therefore they will most especially pity the sufferings of the damned.

### Objection 2.
Further, The blessed will never be so far from taking pity as God is. Yet in a sense God compassionates our afflictions, and therefore He is said to be merciful.

On the contrary, Whoever pities another shares somewhat in his unhappiness. But the blessed cannot share in any unhappiness. Therefore they do not pity the afflictions of the damned.

### I answer that,
Mercy or compassion may be in a person in two ways: first by way of passion, secondly by way of choice. In the blessed there will be no passion in the lower part except as a result of the reason's choice. Hence compassion or mercy will not be in them, except by the choice of reason. Now mercy or compassion comes of the reason's choice when a person wishes another’s evil to be dispelled; therefore in those things which, in accordance with reason, we do not wish to be dispelled, we have no such compassion. But so long as sinners are in this world they are in such a state that without prejudice to the Divine justice they can be taken away from a state of unhappiness and sin to a state of happiness. Consequently it is possible to have compassion on them both by the choice of the will—in which sense God, the angels and the blessed are said to pity them by desiring their salvation—and by passion, in which way they are pitied by the good men who are in the state of wayfarers. But in the future state it will be impossible for them to be taken away from their unhappiness, and consequently it will not be possible to pity their sufferings according to right reason. Therefore the blessed in glory will have no pity on the damned.

### Reply Objection 1.
Charity is the principle of pity when it is possible for us out of charity to wish the cessation of a person's unhappiness. But the saints cannot desire this for the damned, since it would be contrary to Divine justice. Consequently the argument does not prove.

### Reply Objection 2.
God is said to be merciful in so far as He succours those whom it is befitting to be released from their afflictions in accordance with the order of wisdom and justice, not as though He pitied the damned, except perhaps in punishing them less than they deserve.

## Article 3. Whether the Blessed Rejoice in the Punishment of the Wicked?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the blessed do not rejoice in the punishment of the wicked.

### Objection 1.
For rejoicing in another's evil pertains to hatred. But there will be no hatred in the blessed. Therefore they will not rejoice in the unhappiness of the damned.

### Objection 2.
Further, The blessed in heaven will be in the highest degree conformed to God. Now God does not rejoice in our afflictions. Therefore neither will the blessed rejoice in the afflictions of the damned.

### Objection 3.
Further, That which is blameworthy in a wayfarer has no place whatever in a comprehensor. Now it is most reprehensible in a wayfarer to take pleasure in the pains of others, and most praiseworthy to grieve for them. Therefore the blessed in no way rejoice in the punishment of the damned.

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 57. 11): *The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge.*

Further, It is written (Isa. 66. 24): *They shall satiate (Douay, They shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh) the sight of all flesh.* Now satiety denotes refreshment of the mind. Therefore the blessed will rejoice in the punishment of the wicked.

### I answer that,
A thing may be a matter of rejoicing in two ways. First, in itself, when one rejoices in a thing as such, and thus the saints will not rejoice in the punishment of the wicked. Secondly, accidentally, by reason namely of something joined to it; and in this way the saints will rejoice in the punishment of the wicked, by considering therein the order of Divine justice and their own deliverance, which will fill them with joy. And thus the Divine justice and their own deliverance will be the direct cause of the joy of the blessed, while the punishment of the damned will cause it indirectly.

### Reply Objection 1.
To rejoice in another's evil as such belongs to hatred, but not to rejoice in another's evil by reason of something joined to it. Thus a person sometimes rejoices in his own evil as when we rejoice in our own afflictions, as helping us to merit life: *My brethren count it all joy when you shall fall into divers temptations* (Jas. 1. 2).

### Reply Objection 2.
Although God rejoices not in punishments as such, He rejoices in them as being ordered by His justice.

### Reply Objection 3.
It is not praiseworthy in a wayfarer to rejoice in another's afflictions as such, yet it is praiseworthy if he rejoice in them as having some good joined to them. However it is not the same with a wayfarer as with a comprehensor, because in a wayfarer the passions often forestall the judgment of reason, and yet sometimes such passions are praiseworthy, as indicating the good disposition of the mind, as in the case of shame, pity and repentance for evil; but in a comprehensor there can be no passion but such as follows the judgment of reason.

## Question XCV
### Of the Gifts of the Blessed
(In Five Articles)

We must now consider the gifts of the blessed under which head there are five points of inquiry:
1.  Whether any gifts should be assigned to the blessed?
2.  Whether a gift differs from happiness?
3.  Whether it is fitting for Christ to have gifts?
4.  Whether this is fitting to the angels?
5.  Whether three gifts of the soul are rightly assigned?

## Article 1. Whether Any Gifts Should Be Assigned as Dowry to the Blessed?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that no gifts⁶ should be assigned to the blessed.

### Objection 1.
For a dowry (*Cod.* V, 12, *De jure dot.* 20; *Dig.* XXIII, 3, *De jure dot.*)⁷ is given to the bridegroom for the upkeep of the burdens of marriage. But the saints do not resemble the bridegroom but the bride, as being members of the Church. Therefore they receive no dowry.

### Objection 2.
Further, The dowry is given not by the bridegroom's father, but by the father of the bride (*Cod.* V, 11, *De dot. promiss.* 7; *Dig.* XXIII, 2, *De rit. nup.*)⁸ Now all the beatific gifts are bestowed on the blessed by the father of the bridegroom, that is, Christ: *Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down from the Father of lights* (Jas. 1. 17). Therefore these gifts which are bestowed on the blessed should not be called a dowry.

### Objection 3.
Further, In carnal marriage a dowry is given that the burdens of marriage may be the more easily borne. But in spiritual marriage there are no burdens, especially in the state of the Church triumphant. Therefore no dowry should be assigned to that state.

### Objection 4.
Further, A dowry is not given save on the occasion of marriage.⁹ But a spiritual marriage is contracted with Christ by faith in the state of the Church militant. Therefore if a dowry is befitting the blessed, for the same reason it will be befitting the saints who are wayfarers. But it is not befitting the latter, and therefore neither is it befitting the blessed.

### Objection 5.
Further, A dowry pertains to external goods, which are styled goods of fortune, whereas the reward of the blessed will consist of internal goods. Therefore they should not be called a dowry.

On the contrary, It is written (Eph. 5. 32): *This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the Church.* Hence it follows that the spiritual marriage is signified by the carnal marriage. But in a carnal marriage the dowered bride is brought to the dwelling of the bridegroom. Therefore since the saints are brought to Christ's dwelling when they are beatified, it would seem that they are dowered with certain gifts.

Further, A dowry is appointed to carnal marriage for the ease of marriage. But the spiritual marriage is more blissful than the carnal marriage. Therefore a dowry should be especially assigned to it.

Further, The adornment of the bride is part of the dowry. Now the saints are adorned when they are taken into glory, according to Isa. 61. 10, *He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation . . . as a bride adorned with her jewels.* Therefore the saints in heaven have a dowry.

### I answer that,
Without doubt the blessed when they are brought into glory are dowered by God with certain gifts for their adornment, and this adornment is called their dowry by the masters. Hence the dowry of which we speak now is defined thus:
> “The dowry is the everlasting adornment of soul and body, adequate to life, lasting for ever in eternal happiness.”
This description is taken from a likeness to the material dowry whereby the bride is adorned and the husband provided with an adequate support for his wife and children, and yet the dowry remains inalienable from the bride, so that if the marriage union be severed it reverts to her. As to the reason of the name there are various opinions. For some say that the name dowry is taken not from a likeness to the corporeal marriage, but according to the manner of speaking whereby any perfection or adornment of any person whatever is called an endowment; thus a man who is proficient in knowledge is said to be endowed with knowledge, and in this sense Ovid employed the word endowment (*De Arte Amandi*, I, 538)¹⁰:
> “By whatever endowment thou canst please, strive to please.”
But this does not seem quite fitting, for whenever a term is employed to signify a certain thing principally, it is not usually transferred to another save by reason of some likeness. Therefore since by its primary meaning a dowry refers to carnal marriage, it follows that in every other application of the term we must observe some kind of likeness to its principal meaning.

Consequently others say that the likeness consists in the fact that in carnal marriage a dowry is properly a gift bestowed by the bridegroom on the bride for her adornment when she is taken to the bridegroom's dwelling, and that this is shown by the words of Sichem to Jacob and his sons (Gen. 34. 12): *Raise the dowry, and ask gifts*, and from Exod. 22. 16: *If a man seduce a virgin . . . and lie with her, he shall endow her, and have her to wife.* Hence the adornment bestowed by Christ on the saints, when they are brought into the abode of glory, is called a dowry. But this is clearly contrary to what jurists say,¹¹ to whom it belongs to treat of these matters. For they say that a dowry, properly speaking, is a donation on the part of the wife made to those who are on the part of the husband, in view of the marriage burden which the husband has to bear, while that which the bridegroom gives the bride is called “a donation in view of marriage.”¹² In this sense dowry is taken (III Kings 9. 16) where it is stated that *Pharao the king of Egypt, took Gezer . . . and gave it for a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.* Nor do the authorities quoted prove anything to the contrary. For although it is customary for a dowry to be given by the maiden’s parents, it happens sometimes that the bridegroom or his father gives the dowry instead of the bride’s father. And this happens in two ways: either by reason of his very great love for the bride as in the case of Sichem’s father Hemor, who on account of his son's great love for the maiden, wished to give the dowry which he had a right to receive; or as a punishment on the bridegroom, that he should out of his own possessions give a dowry to the virgin seduced by him, whereas he should have received it from the girl’s father. In this sense Moses speaks in the passage quoted above. Therefore in the opinion of others we should hold that in carnal marriage a dowry, properly speaking, is that which is given by those on the wife’s side to those on the husband’s side, for the bearing of the marriage burden, as stated above. Yet the difficulty remains how this meaning can be adapted to the case in point, since the heavenly adornments are given to the spiritual spouse by the Father of the Bridegroom. This shall be made clear by replying to the objections.

### Reply Objection 1.
Although in carnal marriage the dowry is given to the bridegroom for his use, yet the ownership and control belong to the bride, which is evident by the fact that if the marriage be dissolved, the dowry reverts to the bride according to law.¹³ Thus also in spiritual marriage, the very adornments bestowed on the spiritual bride, namely the Church in her members, belong indeed to the Bridegroom, in so far as they conduce to His glory and honour, yet to the bride as adorned by them.

### Reply Objection 2.
The Father of the Bridegroom, that is of Christ, is the Person of the Father alone, while the Father of the bride is the whole Trinity, since that which is effected in creatures belongs to the whole Trinity. Hence in spiritual marriage these endowments, properly speaking, are given by the Father of the bride rather than by the Father of the Bridegroom. Nevertheless, although this endowment is made by all the Persons, it may be in a manner appropriated to each Person. To the Person of the Father, as endowing, since He possesses authority; and fatherhood in relation to creatures is also appropriated to Him, so that He is Father of both Bridegroom and bride. To the Son it is appropriated in so far as it is made for His sake and through Him; and to the Holy Ghost, in so far as it is made in Him and according to Him, since love is the reason of all giving.

### Reply Objection 3.
That which is effected by the dowry belongs to the dowry by its nature, and that is the ease of marriage, while that which the dowry removes, namely the marriage burden which is lightened thereby, belongs to it accidentally; thus it belongs to grace by its nature to make a man just, but accidentally to make an ungodly man just. Accordingly, though there are no burdens in the spiritual marriage, there is the greatest gladness; and that this gladness may be perfected the bride is dowered with gifts, so that by their means she may be happily united with the bridegroom.

### Reply Objection 4.
The dowry is usually settled on the bride not when she is espoused, but when she is taken to the bridegroom's dwelling, so as to be in the presence of the bridegroom, since *while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord* (2 Cor. 5. 6). Hence the gifts bestowed on the saints in this life are not called a dowry, but those which are bestowed on them when they are received into glory, where the Bridegroom delights them with His presence.

### Reply Objection 5.
In spiritual marriage inward comeliness is required, and therefore it is written (Ps. 45. 14): *All the glory of the king’s daughter is within, etc.* But in carnal marriage outward comeliness is necessary. Hence there is no need for a dowry of this kind to be appointed in spiritual marriage as in carnal marriage.

## Article 2. Whether the Dowry Is the Same As Happiness?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the dowry is the same as happiness.

### Objection 1.
For as appears from the definition of dowry (Art. 1), the dowry is the everlasting adornment of body and soul in eternal happiness. Now the happiness of the soul is an adornment of the soul. Therefore happiness is a dowry.

### Objection 2.
Further, A dowry signifies something whereby the union of bride and bridegroom is rendered delightful (Art. 1). Now such is happiness in the spiritual marriage. Therefore happiness is a dowry.

### Objection 3.
Further, According to Augustine (*De Trin.*, I, 8)¹⁴ vision
> “is the whole substance of happiness.”
Now vision is accounted one of the dowries. Therefore happiness is a dowry.

### Objection 4.
Further, Enjoyment (*fruitio*) gives happiness. Now enjoyment is a dowry. Therefore a dowry gives happiness and thus happiness is a dowry.

### Objection 5.
Further, According to Boethius (*De Consol.*, III, 2)¹⁵,
> “happiness is a state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things.”
Now the state of the blessed is perfected by the dowries. Therefore the dowries are a part of happiness.

On the contrary, The dowries are given without merits, whereas happiness is not given, but is awarded in return for merits. Therefore happiness is not a dowry.

Further, happiness is one only, whereas the dowries are several. Therefore happiness is not a dowry.

Further, happiness is in man according to that which is principal in him,¹⁶ whereas a dowry is also appointed to the body. Therefore dowry and happiness are not the same.

### I answer that,
There are two opinions on this question. For some say that happiness and dowry are the same in reality but differ in aspect, because dowry regards the spiritual marriage between Christ and the soul, whereas happiness does not. But it seems that this cannot be, since happiness consists in an operation, whereas a dowry is not an operation, but a quality or disposition. Therefore according to others it must be stated that happiness and dowry differ even in reality, happiness being the perfect operation itself by which the soul is united to God, while the dowries are habits or dispositions or any other qualities directed to this same perfect operation, so that they are ordered to happiness rather than instead of being in it as its parts.

### Reply Objection 1.
Happiness properly speaking is not an adornment of the soul, but something resulting from the soul's adornment, since it is an operation, while its adornment is a certain comeliness of the blessed themselves.

### Reply Objection 2.
Happiness is not directed to the union but is the union itself of the soul with Christ. This union is by an operation, whereas the dowries are gifts disposing to this same union.

### Reply Objection 3.
Vision may be taken in two ways. First, actually, that is for the act itself of vision; and thus vision is not a dowry, but happiness itself. Secondly, it may be taken habitually, that is for the habit whereby this act is elicited, namely, the clarity of glory, by which the soul is enlightened from above to see God, and thus it is a dowry and the principle of happiness, but not happiness itself. The same answer applies to Obj. 4.

## Article 3. Whether It Is Fitting That Christ Should Receive a Dowry?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem fitting that Christ should receive a dowry.

### Objection 1.
For the saints will be conformed to Christ through glory, according to Phil. 3. 21, *Who will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of His glory.* Therefore Christ also will have a dowry.

### Objection 2.
Further, In the spiritual marriage a dowry is given in likeness to a carnal marriage. Now there is a spiritual marriage in Christ which is peculiar to Him, namely of the two natures in one Person, in regard to which the human nature in Him is said to have been espoused by the Word, as a gloss has it¹⁷ on Ps. 19. 6, *He hath set His tabernacle in the sun, etc.*, and Rev. 21. 3, *Behold the tabernacle of God with men.* Therefore it is fitting that Christ should have a dowry.

### Objection 3.
Further, Augustine says¹⁸ that Christ, according to the *Rule of Tyconius*, on account

of the unity of the mystic body that exists between the head and its members, calls Himself also the Bride and not only the Bridegroom, as may be gathered from Isaiah 61:10, "As a bridegroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels." Since then a dowry is due to the bride, it would seem that Christ ought to receive a dowry.

Obj. 4. Further, A dowry is due to all the members of the Church, since the Church is the spouse. But Christ is a member of the Church according to 1 Corinthians 12:27, "You are the body of Christ, and members of members," that is, "of Christ," according to a gloss.^[3^] Therefore the dowry is due to Christ.

Obj. 5. Further, Christ has perfect vision, fruition, and joy. Now these are the dowries. Therefore, etc.

On the contrary, A distinction of persons is requisite between the bridegroom and the bride. But in Christ there is nothing personally distinct from the Son of God Who is the Bridegroom, as stated in John 3:29, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom." Therefore since the dowry is allotted to the bride or for the bride, it would seem unfitting for Christ to have a dowry.

Further, The same person does not both give and receive a dowry. But it is Christ Who gives spiritual dowries. Therefore it is not fitting that Christ should have a dowry.

I answer that, There are two opinions on this point. For some say that there is a threefold union in Christ. One is the union of concord, whereby He is united to God in the bond of love; another is the union of condescension (*dignativa*), whereby the human nature is united to the Divine; the third is the union whereby Christ is united to the Church. They say, then, that as regards the first two unions it is fitting for Christ to have the dowries as such, but as regards the third, it is fitting for Him to have the dowries in the most excellent degree, considered as to that in which they consist, but not considered as dowries; because in this union Christ is the bridegroom and the Church the bride, and a dowry is given to the bride as regards property and control, although it is given to the bridegroom as to use. But this does not seem fitting. For in the union of Christ with the Father by the concord of love, even if we consider Him as God, there is not said to be a marriage, since it implies no subjection such as is required in the bride towards the bridegroom. Nor again in the union of the human nature with the Divine, whether we consider the Personal union or that which regards the conformity of will, can there be a dowry, properly speaking, for three reasons. First, because in a marriage where a dowry is given there should be likeness of nature between bridegroom and bride, and this is lacking in the union of the human nature with the Divine; secondly, because there is required a distinction of persons, and the human nature is not personally distinct from the Word; thirdly, because a dowry is given when the bride is first taken to the dwelling of the bridegroom and thus would seem to belong to the bride, who from being not united becomes united; but the human nature, which was assumed into the unity of Person by the Word, never was otherwise than perfectly united. Therefore in the opinion of others we should say that the notion of dowry is either altogether unbecoming to Christ, or not so properly as to the saints, but that the things which we call dowries befit Him in the highest degree.

Reply Obj. 1. This conformity must be understood to refer to the thing which is a dowry and not to the notion of a dowry being in Christ, for it is not requisite that the thing in which we are conformed to Christ should be in the same way in Christ and in us.

Reply Obj. 2. Human nature is not properly said to be a bride in its union with the Word, since the distinction of persons, which is requisite between bridegroom and bride, is not observed therein. That human nature is sometimes described as being espoused in reference to its union with the Word is because it has a certain act of the bride, in that it is united to the Bridegroom inseparably, and in this union is subject to the Word and ruled by the Word, as the bride by the bridegroom.

Reply Obj. 3. If Christ is sometimes spoken of as the Bride, this is not because He is the Bride in very truth, but in so far as He personifies His spouse, namely the Church, who is united to Him spiritually. Hence nothing hinders Him, in this way of speaking, from being said to have the dowries, not that He Himself is dowered, but the Church.

Reply Obj. 4. The term Church is taken in two senses. For sometimes it denotes the body only, which is united to Christ as its Head. In this way alone has the Church the character of spouse, and in this way Christ is not a member of the Church, but is the Head from which all the members receive. In another sense the Church denotes the head and members united together; and thus Christ is said to be a member of the Church, in so far as He fulfils an office distinct from all others, by pouring forth life into the other members, although He is not very properly called a member, since a member implies a certain restriction, whereas in Christ spiritual good is not restricted but is absolutely entire, so that He is the entire good of the Church, nor is He together with others anything greater than He is by Himself. Speaking of the Church in this sense, the Church denotes not only the bride, but the bridegroom and bride, in so far as one thing results from their spiritual union. Consequently although Christ is called a member of the Church in a certain sense, He can by no means be called a member of the bride, and therefore the idea of a dowry is not fitting to Him.

Reply Obj. 5. There is here a fallacy of accident, for these things are not befitting to Christ if we consider them under the aspect of dowry.

### Article 4. Whether the Angels Receive the Dowries?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the angels receive dowries.

Objection 1. For a gloss on Canticles 6:8, "One is my dove," says:^[4^] "One is the Church among men and angels." But the Church is the bride, and therefore it is fitting for the members of the Church to have the dowries. Therefore the angels have the dowries.

Obj. 2. Further, A gloss on Luke 12:36, "And you yourselves like to men who wait for their Lord, when he shall return from the wedding," says:^[5^] "Our Lord went to the wedding when after His resurrection the new Man espoused to Himself the angelic host." Therefore the angelic hosts are the spouse of Christ and consequently it is fitting that they should have the dowries.

Obj. 3. Further, The spiritual marriage consists in a spiritual union. Now the spiritual union between the angels and God is no less than between beatified men and God. Since, then, the dowries of which we treat now are assigned by reason of a spiritual marriage, it would seem that they are becoming to the angels.

Obj. 4. Further, A spiritual marriage demands a spiritual bridegroom and a spiritual bride. Now the angels are by nature more conformed than men to Christ as the supreme spirit. Therefore a spiritual marriage is more possible between the angels and Christ than between men and Christ.

Obj. 5. Further, A greater conformity is required between the head and members than between bridegroom and bride. Now the conformity between Christ and the angels suffices for Christ to be called the Head of the angels. Therefore for the same reason it suffices for Him to be called their bridegroom.

On the contrary, Origen at the beginning of the prologue to his commentary on the Canticles,^[6^] distinguishes four persons, namely "the bridegroom with the bride, the young maidens, and the companions of the bridegroom"; and he says that "the angels are the companions of the bridegroom." Since then the dowry is due only to the bride, it would seem that the dowries are not becoming to the angels.

Further, Christ espoused the Church by His Incarnation and Passion; hence this is foreshadowed in the words (Exodus 4:25), "A bloody spouse thou art to me." Now by His Incarnation and Passion Christ was not otherwise united to the angels than before. Therefore the angels do not belong to the Church, if we consider the Church as spouse. Therefore the dowries are not becoming to the angels.

I answer that, Without any doubt, whatever pertains to the endowments of the soul is befitting to the angels as it is to men. But considered under the aspect of dowry they are not as becoming to the angels as to men, because the character of bride is not so properly becoming to the angels as to men. For there is required a conformity of nature between bridegroom and bride, that is that they should be of the same species. Now men are in conformity with Christ in this way, since He took human nature, and by so doing became conformed to all men in the specific nature of man. On the other hand, He is not conformed to the angels in unity of species, neither as to His Divine nor as to His human nature. Consequently the notion of dowry is not so properly becoming to angels as to men. Since, however, in metaphorical expressions, it is not necessary to have a likeness in every respect, we must not argue that one thing is not to be said of another metaphorically on account of some lack of likeness; and consequently the argument we have adduced does not prove that the dowries are unbecoming absolutely to the angels, but only that they are not so properly befitting to angels as to men, on account of the aforesaid lack of likeness.

Reply Obj. 1. Although the angels are included in the unity of the Church, they are not members of the Church according to conformity of nature, if we consider the Church as bride; and thus it is not properly fitting for them to have the dowries.

Reply Obj. 2. Espousal is taken there in a broad sense, for union without conformity of specific nature, and in this sense nothing prevents our saying that the angels have the dowries taking these in a broad sense.

Reply Obj. 3. In the spiritual marriage although there is no other than a spiritual union, those whose union answers to the idea of a perfect marriage should agree in specific nature. Hence espousal does not properly befit the angels.

Reply Obj. 4. The conformity between the angels and Christ as God is not such as suffices for the notion of a perfect marriage, since so far are they from agreeing in species that there is still an infinite distance between them.

Reply Obj. 5. Not even is Christ properly called the Head of the angels, if we consider the head as requiring conformity of nature with the members. We must observe, however, that although the head and the other members are parts of an individual of one species, if we consider each one by itself, it is not of the same species as another member, for a hand is another specific part from the head. Hence, speaking of the members in themselves, the only conformity required among them is one of proportion, so that one receive from another, and one serve another. Consequently the conformity between God and the angels suffices for the notion of head rather than for that of bridegroom.

### Article 5. Whether Three Dowries of the Soul Are Suitably Assigned?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem unfitting to assign to the soul three dowries, namely, vision, love and enjoyment.

Objection 1. For the soul is united to God according to the mind wherein is the image of the Trinity in respect of the memory, understanding, and will. Now love regards the will, and vision the understanding. Therefore there should be something corresponding to the memory, since enjoyment pertains not the memory but the will.

Obj. 2. Further, The beatific dowries are said to correspond to the virtues of the way, which united us to God, and these are faith, hope, and charity, whereby God Himself is the object. Now love corresponds to charity, and vision to faith. Therefore there should be something corresponding to hope, since enjoyment corresponds rather to charity.

Obj. 3. Further, We enjoy God by love and vision only, since "we are said to enjoy those things which we love for their own sake," as Augustine says.^[7^] Therefore enjoyment should not be put as a distinct dowry from love.

Obj. 4. Further, Comprehension is required for the perfection of happiness: "So run that you may comprehend" (1 Corinthians 9:24). Therefore we should put a fourth dowry.

Obj. 5. Further, Anselm says (*De Similitudinibus*, XLVIII)^[8^] that the following pertain to the soul's happiness: "wisdom, friendship, concord, power, honour, security, joy," and consequently the above dowries are assigned unsuitably.

Obj. 6. Further, Augustine says^[9^] that "in that Happiness God will be seen unendingly, loved without wearying, praised untiringly." Therefore praise should be added to the aforesaid dowries.

Obj. 7. Further, Boethius affirms five things pertaining to happiness (*De Consolatione Philosophiae*, III, 10)^[10^] and these are: Sufficiency, which wealth offers; joy, which pleasure offers; celebrity, which fame offers; security, which power offers; reverence, which dignity offers. Consequently it seems that these should be reckoned as dowries rather than the aforesaid.

I answer that, All agree in affirming three dowries of the soul, in different ways however. For some say that the three dowries of the soul are vision, love, and enjoyment; others say they are vision, comprehension, and enjoyment; others, vision, delight, and comprehension. However, all these reckonings come to the same, and their number is assigned in the same way. For it has been said (a. 2) that a dowry is something inherent to the soul, and directing it to the operation in which happiness consists. Now two things are required in this operation: its essence, which is vision; and its perfection, which is delight. For happiness must be a perfect operation. Again, a vision is delightful in two ways: first, on the part of the object, by reason of the thing seen being delightful; secondly, on the part of the vision, by reason of the seeing itself being delightful, even as we delight in knowing evil things, although the evil things themselves delight us not. And since this operation wherein ultimate happiness consists must be most perfect, this vision must be delightful in both ways.

Now in order that this vision be delightful on the part of the vision, it needs to be made connatural to the seer by means of a habit; while for it to be delightful on the part of the visible object, two things are necessary, namely that the visible object be suitable, and that it be united to the seer. Accordingly for the vision to be delightful on its own part a habit is required to elicit the vision, and thus we have one dowry, which all call vision. But on the part of the visible object two things are necessary. First, suitableness, which regards the affections,—and in this respect some account love as a dowry, others enjoyment (in so far as enjoyment regards the affective part) since what we love most we consider most suitable. Secondly, union is required on the part of the visible object, and thus some account comprehension, which is nothing else than to have God present and to hold Him within oneself; while others assign enjoyment, not of hope, which is ours while on the way, but of possession,^[11^] which is in heaven.

Thus the three dowries correspond to the three theological virtues, namely vision to faith, comprehension (or enjoyment in one sense) to hope, and enjoyment (or delight according to another reckoning) to charity. For perfect enjoyment such as will be had in heaven includes delight and comprehension, for which reason some take it for the one, and some for the other.

Others, however, ascribe these three dowries to the three powers of the soul, namely vision to the rational, delight to the concupiscible, and enjoyment to the irascible powers, seeing that this enjoyment is acquired by a victory. But this is not said properly, because the irascible and concupiscible powers are not in the intellectual but in the sensitive part, whereas the dowries of the soul are assigned to the mind.

Reply Obj. 1. Memory and understanding have but one act: either because understanding is itself an act of memory, or—if understanding denote a power—because memory does not proceed to act save through the medium of the understanding, since it belongs to the memory to retain knowledge. Consequently there is only one habit, namely knowledge, corresponding to memory and understanding, and therefore only one dowry, namely vision, corresponds to both.

Reply Obj. 2. Enjoyment corresponds to hope, in so far as it includes comprehension which will take the place of hope, since we hope for that which we have not yet; therefore hope chafes somewhat on account of the distance of the beloved, for which reason it will not remain in heaven, but will be succeeded by comprehension.

Reply Obj. 3. Enjoyment as including comprehension is distinct from vision and love, but otherwise than love from vision. For love and vision denote different habits, the one belonging to the intellect, the other to the affective power. But comprehension, or enjoyment as denoting comprehension, does not signify a habit distinct from those two, but the removal of the obstacles which made it impossible for the mind to be united to God by actual vision. This is brought about by the habit of glory freeing the soul from all defects; for instance by making it capable of knowledge without phantasms, of complete control over the body, and so forth, thus removing the obstacles which result in our being pilgrims from the Lord.

Reply Obj. 4 is clear from what has been said.

Reply Obj. 5. Properly speaking, the dowries are the immediate principles of the operation in which perfect happiness consists and by which the soul is united to Christ. The things mentioned by Anselm do not answer to this description, but they are such as in any way accompany or follow happiness, not only in relation to the Bridegroom, to Whom wisdom alone of the things mentioned by him refers, but also in relation to others. They may be either one's equals, to whom friendship refers as regards the union of affections, and concord as regards consent in actions, or one's inferiors, to whom power refers, so far as inferior things are ordered by superior, and honour as regards that which inferiors offer to their superiors. Or again (they may accompany or follow Happiness) in relation to oneself: to this security refers as regards the removal of evil, and joy as regards the attainment of good.

Reply Obj. 6. Praise, which Augustine mentions as the third of those things which will obtain in heaven, is not a disposition to happiness but rather a sequel to happiness, because from the very fact of the soul's union with God, in which happiness consists, it follows that the soul breaks forth into praise. Hence praise has not the necessary conditions of a dowry.

Reply Obj. 7. The five things aforesaid mentioned by Boethius are certain conditions of happiness, but not dispositions to happiness or to its act, because happiness by reason of its perfection has of itself alone and undividedly all that men seek in various things, as the Philosopher declares.^[12^] Accordingly Boethius shows that these five things obtain in perfect happiness, because they are what men seek in temporal happiness. For they pertain either, as security, to immunity from evil; or to the attainment either of the suitable good, as joy, or of the perfect good, as sufficiency, or to the manifestation of good, as celebrity, in so far as the good of one is made known to others, or as reverence, as indicating that good or the knowledge of it, for reverence is the showing of honour which bears witness to virtue. Hence it is evident that these five should not be called dowries, but conditions of happiness.

## QUESTION XCVI
Of the Aureoles
(In Thirteen Articles)

In the next place we must consider the aureoles. Under this head there are thirteen points of inquiry: (1) Whether the aureoles differ from the essential reward? (2) Whether they differ from the fruit? (3) Whether a fruit is due to the virtue of continence only? (4) Whether three fruits are fittingly assigned to the three parts of continence? (5) Whether an aureole is due to virgins? (6) Whether it is due to martyrs? (7) Whether it is due to doctors? (8) Whether it is due to Christ? (9) Whether to the angels? (10) Whether it is due to the human body? (11) Whether three aureoles are fittingly assigned? (12) Whether the virgin's aureole is the greatest? (13) Whether one has the same aureole in a higher degree than another?

### Article 1. Whether the Aureole Is the Same As the Essential Reward Which Is Called the Aurea

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that the aureole is not distinct from the essential reward which is called the aurea.

Objection 1. For the essential reward is Happiness itself. Now according to Boethius (*De Consolatione Philosophiae*, III, 2),^[13^] happiness is "a state rendered perfect by the aggregate of all goods." Therefore the essential reward includes every good possessed in heaven, so that the aureole is included in the aurea.

Obj. 2. Further, More and less do not change a species. But those who keep the counsels and commandments receive a greater reward than those who keep the commandments only, nor it seems does their reward differ, except in one reward being greater than another. Since then the aureole denotes the reward due to works of perfection it would seem that it does not signify something distinct from the aurea.

Obj. 3. Further, Reward corresponds to merit. Now charity is the root of all merit. Since then the aurea corresponds to charity, it would seem that there will be no reward in heaven other than the aurea.

Obj. 4. Further, "All the blessed are taken into the angelic orders," as Gregory declares (*Hom. XXXIV in Evang.*).^[14^] Now as regards the angels, "though some of them receive certain gifts in a higher degree, nothing is possessed by any of them exclusively, for all gifts are in all of them, though not equally, because some are endowed more highly than others with gifts which, however, they all possess," as Gregory says (*ibid.*).^[15^] Therefore as regards the blessed, there will be no reward other than that which is common to all. Therefore the aureole is not a distinct reward from the aurea.

Obj. 5. Further, A higher reward is due to higher merit. If, then, the aurea is due to works which are of obligation, and the aureole to works of counsel, the aureole will be more perfect than the aurea, and consequently should not be expressed by a diminutive (*Aureola*, that is, a little *aurea*). Therefore it would seem that the aureole is not a distinct reward from the aurea.

On the contrary, A gloss on Exodus 25:24-25, "Thou shalt make . . . another little golden crown" (*coronam aureolam*), says:^[16^] "This crown denotes the new hymn which the virgins alone sing in the presence of the Lamb." Therefore apparently the aureole is a crown awarded not to all, but especially to some, whereas the aurea is awarded to all the blessed. Therefore the aureole is distinct from the aurea.

Further, A crown is due to the fight which is followed by victory: "He . . . is not crowned except he strive lawfully" (2 Timothy 2:5). Hence where there is a special kind of conflict, there should be a special crown. Now in certain works there is a special kind of conflict. Therefore they deserve a special kind of crown, which we call an aureole.

Further, The Church militant comes down from the Church triumphant: "I saw the Holy City, etc." (Revelation 21:2). Now in the Church militant special rewards are given to those who perform special deeds, for instance a crown to the conqueror, a prize to the runner. Therefore the same should obtain in the Church triumphant.

I answer that, Man's essential reward, which is his Happiness, consists in the perfect union of the soul with God, in so far as it enjoys God perfectly as seen and loved perfectly. Now this reward is called a crown or aurea metaphorically, both with reference to merit which is gained by a kind of conflict,—since the life of man upon earth is a warfare (Job 7:1),—and with reference to the reward whereby in a way man is made a participator of the Godhead, and consequently endowed with regal power: "Thou hast made us to our God a kingdom, etc." (Revelation 5:10); for a crown is the proper sign of regal power.

In like manner the accidental reward which is added to the essential has the character of a crown. For a crown signifies some kind of perfection, on account of its circular shape, so that for this very reason it is becoming to the perfection of the blessed. Since, however, nothing can be added to the essential but what is less than it, the additional reward is called an aureole. Now something may be added in two ways to this essential reward which we call the aurea. First, in consequence of a condition attaching to the nature of the one rewarded; thus the glory of the body is added to the Happiness of the soul, and so this same glory of the body is sometimes called an aureole. Thus a gloss of Bede^[17^] on Exodus 25:25, "Thou . . . shalt make another little golden crown," says that "finally the aureole is added, when it is stated in the Scriptures that a higher degree of glory is in store for us when our bodies are resumed." But it is not in this sense that we speak of an aureole now. Secondly, in consequence of the nature of the meritorious act. Now this has the character of merit on two counts, from which also it has the character of good. First, namely, from its root which is charity, since it is referred to the last end, and thus there is due to it the essential reward, namely the attainment of the end, and this is the aurea. Secondly, from the very genus of the act which derives a certain praiseworthiness from its due circumstances, from the habit eliciting it and from its proximate end, and

thus is due to it a kind of accidental reward which we call an *aureole*; and it is in this sense that we regard the *aureole* now. Accordingly it must be said that an *aureole* denotes something added to the *aurea*, a kind of joy, that is, in the works one has done, in that they have the character of a signal victory, for this joy is distinct from the joy in being united to God, which is called the *aurea*. Some, however, affirm that the common reward, which is the *aurea*, receives the name of *aureole*, according as it is given to virgins, martyrs, or doctors, even as money receives the name of debt through being due to someone, though the money and the debt are altogether the same. And that nevertheless this does not imply that the essential reward is any greater when it is called an *aureole*, but that it corresponds to a more excellent act, more excellent not in intensity of merit but in the manner of meriting, so that although two persons may have the divine vision with equal clearness, it is called an *aureole* in one and not in the other, in so far as it corresponds to higher merit as regards the way of meriting. But this would seem contrary to the meaning of the gloss quoted above. For if *aurea* and *aureole* were the same, the *aureole* would not be described as added to the *aurea*. Moreover, since reward corresponds to merit, a more excellent reward must correspond to this more excellent way of meriting, and it is this excellence that we call an *aureole*. Hence it follows that an *aureole* differs from the *aurea*.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Happiness includes all the goods necessary for man’s perfect life consisting in his perfect operation. Yet some things can be added not as being necessary for that perfect operation as though it were impossible without them, but as adding to the glory of happiness. Hence they regard the well-being of happiness and a certain fitness of happiness. Even so civic happiness is embellished by nobility and bodily beauty and so forth, and yet it is possible without them as stated in the *Ethics*;¹ and in this way is the *aureole* in comparison with the happiness of heaven.

### Reply Obj. 2.
He who keeps the counsels and the commandments always merits more than he who keeps the commandments only, if we gather the notion of merit in works from the very genus of those works; but not always if we gauge the merit from its root, charity, since sometimes a man keeps the commandments alone out of greater charity than one who keeps both commandments and counsels. For the most part, however, the contrary happens, because “the proof of love is in the performance of deeds,” as Gregory says (*Hom. xxx in Ev.*).² Therefore it is not the more excellent essential reward that is called an *aureole*, but that which is added to the essential reward without reference to the essential reward of the possessor of an *aureole* being greater, or less than, or equal to the essential reward of one who has no *aureole*.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Charity is the first principle of merit, but our actions are the instruments, so to speak, by which we merit. Now in order to obtain an effect there is required not only a due disposition in the first mover, but also a right disposition in the instrument. Hence something principal results in the effect with reference to the first mover, and something secondary with reference to the instrument. Therefore in the reward also there is something on the part of charity, namely the *aurea*, and something on the part of the kind of work, namely the *aureole*.

### Reply Obj. 4.
All the angels merited their happiness by the same kind of act, namely by turning to God, and consequently no particular reward is found in anyone which another has not in some way. But men merit happiness by different kinds of acts, and so the comparison fails.

Nevertheless among men what one seems to have specially, all have in common in some way, in so far as each one, by charity, deems another’s good his own. Yet this joy whereby one shares another’s joy cannot be called an *aureole*, because it is not given him as a reward for his victory, but regards more the victory of another; but a crown is awarded the victors themselves and not to those who rejoice with them in the victory.

### Reply Obj. 5.
The merit arising from charity is more excellent than that which arises from the kind of action, just as the end to which charity directs us is more excellent than the things directed to that end, and with which our actions are concerned. Therefore the reward corresponding to merit by reason of charity, however little it may be, is greater than any reward corresponding to an action by reason of its genus. Hence *aureole* is used as a diminutive in comparison with *aurea*.

## Article 2. Whether the Aureole Differs from the Fruit?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the *aureole* does not differ from the fruit.

### Objection 1.
For different rewards are not due to the same merit. Now the *aureole* and the hundredfold fruit correspond to the same merit, according to a gloss³ on Matt. 13. 8, *Some a hundredfold*. Therefore the *aureole* is the same as the fruit.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Augustine says (*De Virginibus*, xlv)⁴ that “the hundredfold fruit is due to the martyrs, and also to virgins.” Therefore the fruit is a reward common to virgins and martyrs. But the *aureole* also is due to them. Therefore the *aureole* is the same as the fruit.

### Obj. 3.
Further, There are only two rewards in happiness, namely the essential, and the accidental which is added to the essential. Now that which is added to the essential reward is called an *aureole* (Art. 1), as evidenced by the statement (Exod. 25. 25) that the little crown (*aureola*) is added to the crown. But the fruit is not the essential reward, for in that case it would be due to all the blessed. Therefore it is the same as the *aureole*.

### On the contrary,
Things which are not divided in the same way are not of the same nature. Now fruit and *aureole* are not divided in the same way, since *aureole* is divided into the *aureole* of virgins, of martyrs, and of doctors, whereas fruit is divided into the fruit of the married, of widows, and of virgins. Therefore fruit and *aureole* are not the same.

Further, If fruit and *aureole* were the same, the *aureole* would be due to whomsoever the fruit is due. But this is manifestly untrue, since a fruit is due to widowhood, while an *aureole* is not. Therefore, etc.

### I answer that,
Metaphorical expressions can be taken in various ways, according as we find resemblances to the various properties of the thing from which the comparison is taken. Now since fruit, properly speaking, is applied to material things born of the earth, we employ it variously in a spiritual sense, with reference to the various conditions that obtain in material fruits. For the material fruit has sweetness whereby it refreshes so far as it is used by man; again it is the last thing to which the operation of nature attains; moreover it is that to which husbandry looks forward as the result of sowing or any other process.

Accordingly fruit is taken in a spiritual sense sometimes for that which refreshes, as being the last end, and according to this signification we are said to enjoy (*frui*) God perfectly in heaven, and imperfectly on the way. From this signification we have *fruition*, which is a dowry, but we are not speaking of fruit in this sense now.

Sometimes fruit signifies spiritually that which refreshes only, though it is not the last end; and thus the virtues are called fruits, since “they refresh the mind with genuine sweetness,” as Ambrose says.⁵ In this sense fruit is taken (Gal. 5. 22): *The fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, etc.* Nor again is this the sense in which we speak of fruit now, for we have treated of this already.

We may, however, take spiritual fruit in another sense, in likeness to material fruit, according as material fruit is a profit expected from the labour of husbandry, so that we call fruit that reward which man acquires from his labour in this life, and thus every reward which by our labours we shall acquire for the future life is called a fruit. In this sense fruit is taken (Rom. 6. 22): *You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting*. Yet neither in this sense do we speak of fruit now, but we are treating of fruit as being the product of seed, for it is in this sense that our Lord speaks of fruit (Matt. 13. 23), where He divides fruit into thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold. Now fruit is the product of seed in so far as the seed power is capable of transforming the humours of the soil into its own nature; and the more efficient this power, and the better prepared the soil, the more plentiful fruit will result. Now the spiritual seed which is sown in us is the Word of God; therefore the more a person is transformed into a spiritual nature by withdrawing from carnal things, the greater is the fruit of the Word in him. Accordingly the fruit of the Word of God differs from the *aurea* and the *aureole*, in that the *aurea* consists in the joy one has in God, and the *aureole* in the joy one has in the perfection of one’s works, while the fruit consists in the joy that the worker has in his own disposition as to his degree of spirituality to which he has attained through the seed of God’s Word.

Some, however, distinguish between *aureole* and fruit, by saying that the *aureole* is due to the fighter, according to 2 Tim. 2. 5, *He . . . shall not be crowned, except he strive lawfully*, while the fruit is due to the labourer, according to the saying of Wis. 3. 15, *The fruit of good labours is glorious*. Others again say that the *aurea* regards conversion to God, while the *aureole* and the fruit regard things directed to the end; yet so that the fruit regards the will rather, and the *aureole* the body. Since, however, labour and strife are in the same subject and about the same matter, and since the body’s reward depends on the soul’s, these explanations of the difference between fruit, *aurea* and *aureole* would only imply a logical difference, and this cannot be, since fruit is assigned to some to whom no *aureole* is assigned.

### Reply Obj. 1.
There is nothing incongruous if various rewards correspond to the same merit according to the various things contained therein. Therefore to virginity corresponds the *aurea* in so far as virginity is kept for God’s sake at the command of charity; the *aureole*, in so far as virginity is a work of perfection having the character of a signal victory; and the fruit, in so far as by virginity a person acquires a certain spirituality by withdrawing from carnal things.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Fruit, according to the proper acceptation as we are speaking of it now, does not denote the reward common to martyrdom and virginity, but that which corresponds to the three degrees of continency. This gloss which states that the hundredfold fruit corresponds to martyrs takes fruit in a broad sense, according as any reward is called a fruit, the hundredfold fruit thus denoting the reward due to any perfect works whatever.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Although the *aureole* is an accidental reward added to the essential reward, nevertheless not every accidental reward is an *aureole*, but only that which is assigned to works of perfection, whereby man is most conformed to Christ in the achievement of a perfect victory (Art. 1). Hence it is not unfitting that another accidental reward, which is called the fruit, be due sometimes to the withdrawal from a carnal life.

## Article 3. Whether a Fruit Is Due to the Virtue of Continence Alone?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that a fruit is not due to the virtue of continence alone.

### Objection 1.
For a gloss on 1 Cor. 15. 41, *One is the glory of the sun*, says⁶ that “the worth of those who have the hundredfold fruit is compared to the glory of the sun; to the glory of the moon those who have the sixtyfold fruit; and to the stars those who have the thirtyfold fruit.” Now this difference of glory, in the meaning of the Apostle, regards any difference whatever of happiness. Therefore the various fruits should correspond to none but the virtue of continence.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Fruits are so called from *fruition*. But *fruition* belongs to the essential reward which corresponds to all the virtues. Therefore, etc.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Fruit is due to labour: *The fruit of good labours is glorious* (Wis. 3. 15). Now there is greater labour in fortitude than in temperance or continence. Therefore fruit does not correspond to continence alone.

### Obj. 4.
Further, It is more difficult not to exceed the measure in food which is necessary for life, than in sexual matters without which life can be sustained; and thus the labour of frugality is greater than that of continence. Therefore fruit corresponds to frugality rather than to continence.

### Obj. 5.
Further, Fruit implies refreshment, and refreshment regards especially the end. Since then the theological virtues have the end for their object, namely God Himself, it would seem that to them especially the fruit should correspond.

### On the contrary
is the statement of the gloss⁷ on Matt. 13. 23, *The one a hundredfold*, which assigns the fruits to virginity, widowhood, and conjugal continence, which are parts of continence.

### I answer that,
A fruit is a reward due to a person in that he passes from the carnal to the spiritual life. Consequently a fruit corresponds especially to that virtue which more than any other frees man from subjection to the flesh. Now this is the effect of continence, since it is by sexual pleasures that the soul is especially subject to the flesh; so much so that in the carnal act, according to Jerome,⁸ not even *the spirit of prophecy touches the heart of the prophet*, nor “is it possible to understand anything in the midst of that pleasure,” as the Philosopher says.⁹ Therefore fruit corresponds to continence rather than to another virtue.

### Reply Obj. 1.
This gloss takes fruit in a broad sense, according as any reward is called a fruit.

### Reply Obj. 2.
*Fruition* does not take its name from fruit by reason of any comparison with fruit in the sense in which we speak of it now, as evidenced by what has been said.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Fruit, as we speak of it now, corresponds to labour not as resulting in fatigue, but as resulting in the production of fruit. Hence a man calls his crops his labour, in so far as he laboured for them, or produced them by his labour. Now the comparison to fruit, as produced from seed, is more adapted to continence than to fortitude, because man is not subjected to the flesh by the passions of fortitude, as he is by the passions with which continence is concerned.

### Reply Obj. 4.
Although the pleasures of the table are more necessary than the pleasures of sex, they are not so strong; therefore the soul is not so much subjected to the flesh by them.

### Reply Obj. 5.
Fruit is not taken here in the sense in which enjoyment applies to refreshment in the end, but in another sense as stated above (Art. 2). Hence the argument proves nothing.

## Article 4. Whether Three Fruits Are Fittingly Assigned to the Three Parts of Continence?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that three fruits are unfittingly assigned to the three parts of continence.

### Objection 1.
For twelve fruits of the Spirit are assigned, *charity, joy, peace, etc.* (Gal. 5. 22). Therefore it seems that we should assign only three.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Fruit denotes a special reward. Now the reward assigned to virgins, widows, and married persons is not a special reward, because all who are to be saved are comprised under one of these three, since no one is saved who lacks continence, and continence is adequately divided by these three. Therefore three fruits are unfittingly assigned to these three.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Just as widowhood surpasses conjugal continence, so does virginity surpass widowhood. But the excess of sixtyfold over thirtyfold is not as the excess of a hundredfold over sixtyfold; neither in arithmetical proportion, since sixty exceeds thirty by thirty, and a hundred exceeds sixty by forty; nor in geometrical proportion, since sixty is twice thirty and a hundred surpasses sixty as containing the whole and two-thirds of it. Therefore the fruits are unfittingly adapted to the degrees of continence.

### Obj. 4.
Further, The statements contained in Holy Writ stand for all time: *Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away* (Luke 21. 33), whereas human institutions are liable to change every day. Therefore human institutions are not to be taken as a criterion of the statements of Holy Writ, and it would seem in consequence that the explanation of these fruits given by Bede is unfitting. For he says (*Expos. in Luc.* 3. 8)¹⁰ that “the thirtyfold fruit is assigned to married persons, because in the signs drawn on the ‘*abacus*’ the number 30 is denoted by the thumb and index finger touching one another at the tips as though kissing one another, so that the number 30 denotes the embraces of married persons. The number 60 is denoted by the contact of the index finger above the middle joint of the thumb, so that the index finger by lying over the thumb and weighing on it, signifies the burden which widows have to bear in this world. When, however, in the course of enumeration we come to the number 100 we pass from the left to the right hand, so that the number 100 denotes virginity, which has a share in the angelic excellence; for the angels are on the right hand, that is, in glory, while we are on the left on account of the imperfection of the present life.

### I answer that,
By continence, to which the fruit corresponds, man is brought to a kind of spiritual nature, by withdrawing from carnal things. Consequently various fruits are distinguished according to the various manners of the spirituality resulting from continence. Now there is a certain spirituality which is necessary, and one which is superabundant. The spirituality that is necessary consists in the rectitude of the spirit not being disturbed by the pleasures of the flesh, and this obtains when one makes use of carnal pleasures according to the order of right reason. This is the spirituality of married persons. Spirituality is superabundant when a man withdraws himself entirely from those carnal pleasures which stifle the spirit. This may be done in two ways: either in respect of all time past, present, and future, and this is the spirituality of virgins; or in respect of a particular time, and this is the spirituality of widows.

Accordingly to those who keep conjugal continence, the thirtyfold fruit is awarded; to those who keep the continence of widows, the sixtyfold fruit; and to those who keep virginal continence, the hundredfold fruit, and this for the reason given by Bede quoted above, although another motive may be found in the very nature of the numbers. For 30 is the product of 3 multiplied by 10. Now 3 is the number of everything, as stated in *On the Heavens*,¹¹ and contains a certain perfection common to all, namely of beginning, middle, and end. Therefore the number 30 is fittingly assigned to married persons, in whom no other perfection is added to the observance of the Decalogue, signified by the number 10, than the common perfection without which there is no salvation. The number six, the multiplication of which by 10 amounts to 60 has perfection from its parts, being the aggregate of all its parts taken together. Therefore it corresponds fittingly to widowhood, in which we find perfect withdrawal from carnal pleasures as to all its circumstances (which are the parts, so to speak, of a virtuous act), since widowhood uses no carnal pleasures in connection with any person, place, or any other circumstance, which was not the case with conjugal continence. The number 100 corresponds fittingly to virginity, because the number 10 of which 100 is a multiple is the limit of numbers, and in like manner virginity occupies the limit of spirituality, since no further spirituality can be added to it. The number 100 also being a square number has perfection from its figure, for a square figure is perfect through being equal on all sides, since all its sides are equal. Therefore it is adapted to virginity in which incorruption is found equally as to all times.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Fruit is not taken there in the sense in which we are taking it now.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Nothing obliges us to hold that fruit is a reward that is not common to all who will be saved. For not only the essential reward is common to all, but also a certain accidental reward, such as joy in those works without which one cannot be saved. Yet it may be said that the fruits are not becoming to all who will be saved, as is evidently the case with those who repent in the end after leading an incontinent life, for to such no fruit is due but only the essential reward.

### Reply Obj. 3.
The distinction of the fruits is to be taken according to the species and figures of the numbers rather than according to their quantity. Nevertheless even if we regard the excess in point of quantity, we may find an explanation. For the married man abstains only from one that is not his, the widow from both hers and not hers, so that in the latter case we find the notion of double, just as 60 is the double of 30. Again 100 is 60+40, which latter number is the product of 4X10, and the number 4 is the first solid and square number. Thus the addition of this number is fitting to virginity, which adds perpetual incorruption to the perfection of widowhood.

### Reply Obj. 4.
Although these numerical signs are a human institution, they are founded somewhat on the nature of things, in so far as the numbers are denoted in gradation, according to the order of the aforesaid joints and contacts.

## Article 5. Whether an Aureole Is Due on Account of Virginity?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that an *aureole* is not due on account of virginity.

### Objection 1.
For where there is greater difficulty in the work, a greater reward is due. Now widows have greater difficulty than virgins in abstaining from the works of the flesh. For Jerome says (*Epist. ad Ageruchiam*)¹² that the greater difficulty certain persons experience in abstaining from the allurements of pleasure, the greater their reward, and he is speaking in praise of widows. Moreover, the Philosopher says¹³ that “*young women who have been deflowered desire sexual intercourse the more for the recollection of the pleasure*.” Therefore the *aureole* which is the greatest reward is due to widows more than to virgins.

### Obj. 2.
Further, If an *aureole* were due to virginity, it would be especially found where there is the most perfect virginity. Now the most perfect virginity is in the Blessed Virgin, and therefore she is called the Virgin of virgins; and yet no *aureole* is due to her because she experienced no conflict in being continent, for she was not infected with the corruption of the *fomes*. Therefore an *aureole* is not due to virginity.

### Obj. 3.
Further, A special reward is not due to that which has not been at all times praiseworthy. Now it would not have been praiseworthy to observe virginity in the state of innocence, since then was it commanded: *Increase and multiply and fill the earth* (Gen. 1. 28); nor again during the time of the Law, since the barren were accursed. Therefore an *aureole* is not due to virginity.

### Obj. 4.
Further, The same reward is not due to virginity observed, and virginity lost. Yet an *aureole* is sometimes due to lost virginity; for instance if a maiden is violated unwillingly at the order of a tyrant for confessing Christ. Therefore an *aureole* is not due to virginity.

### Obj. 5.
Further, A special reward is not due to that which is in us by nature. But virginity is inborn in every man both good and wicked. Therefore an *aureole* is not due to virginity.

### Obj. 6.
Further, As widowhood is to the sixtyfold fruit, so is virginity to the hundredfold fruit, and to the *aureole*. Now the sixtyfold fruit is not due to every widow, but only, as some say, to one who vows to remain a widow. Therefore it would seem that neither is the *aureole* due to any kind of virginity, but only to that which is observed by vow.

### Obj. 7.
Further, Reward is not given to that which is done of necessity, since all merit depends on the will. But some are virgins of necessity, such as those who are naturally cold-blooded, and eunuchs. Therefore an *aureole* is not always due to virginity.

### On the contrary,
A gloss on Exod. 25. 25: *Thou shalt also make a little golden crown* (*coronam aureolam*) says.¹⁴ “This crown denotes the new hymn which the virgins sing in the presence of the Lamb, those, namely, who follow the Lamb wherever He goes.” Therefore the reward due to virginity is called an *aureole*.

Further, It is written (Isa. 56. 4): *Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs*; and the text continues (verse 5): *I will give to them . . . a name better than sons and daughters*; and a gloss says:¹⁵ “This refers to their peculiar and transcendent glory.” Now the eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 19. 12) denote virgins. Therefore it would seem that some special reward is due to virginity, and this is called the *aureole*.

### I answer that,
Where there is a notable kind of victory, a special crown is due. Therefore since by virginity a person wins a signal victory over the flesh, against which a continuous battle is waged: *The flesh lusteth against the spirit, etc.* (Gal. 5. 17), a special crown called the *aureole* is due to virginity. This indeed is the common opinion of all; but all are not agreed as to the kind of virginity to which it is due.

For some say that the *aureole* is due to the act. So that she who actually remains a virgin will have the *aureole* provided she be of the number of the saved. But this would seem unreasonable, because in this case those who have the will to marry and nevertheless die before marrying would have the *aureole*. Hence others hold that the *aureole* is due to the state and not to the act, so that those virgins alone merit

the aureole who by vow have placed themselves in the state of observing perpetual virginity. But this also seems unreasonable, because it is possible to have the same intention of observing virginity without a vow as with a vow. Hence it may be said otherwise that merit is due to every virtuous act commanded by charity. Now virginity comes under the genus of virtue in so far as perpetual incorruption of mind and body is an object of choice, as appears from what has been said above. [3] Consequently the aureole is due to those virgins alone who had the purpose of observing perpetual virginity, whether or no they have confirmed this purpose by vow,—and this I say with reference to the aureole in its proper signification of a reward due to merit,—although this purpose may at some time have been interrupted, integrity of the flesh remaining nevertheless, provided it be found at the end of life, because virginity of the mind may be restored, although virginity of the flesh cannot.

If however, we take the aureole in its broad sense for any joy added to the essential joy of heaven, the aureole will be applicable even to those who are incorrupt in flesh, although they had not the purpose of observing perpetual virginity. For without doubt they will rejoice in the incorruption of their body, even as the innocent will rejoice in having been free from sin, although they had no opportunity of sinning, as in the case of baptized children. But this is not the proper meaning of an aureole, although it is very commonly taken in this sense.

Reply Obj. 1. In some respects virgins experience a greater conflict in remaining continent; and in other respects, widows, other things being equal. For virgins are inflamed by concupiscence, and by the desire of experience, which arises from a certain curiosity as it were, which makes man more willing to see what he has never seen. Sometimes, moreover, this concupiscence is increased by their esteeming the pleasure to be greater than it is in reality, and by their failing to consider the grievances attaching to this pleasure. In these respects widows experience the lesser conflict, yet theirs is the greater conflict by reason of their recollection of the pleasure. Moreover, in different subjects one motive is stronger than another according to the various conditions and dispositions of the subject, because some are more susceptible to one, and others to another. However, whatever we may say of the degree of conflict, this is certain,—that the virgin’s victory is more perfect than the widow’s, for the most perfect and most brilliant kind of victory is never to have yielded to the foe; and the crown is due, not to the battle but to the victory gained by the battle.

Reply Obj. 2. There are two opinions about this. For some say that the Blessed Virgin has not an aureole in reward of her virginity, if we take aureole in the proper sense as referring to a conflict, but that she has something more than an aureole, on account of her most perfect purpose of observing virginity. Others say that she has an aureole even in its proper signification, and that a most transcendent one, for though she experienced no conflict, she had a certain conflict of the flesh, but owing to the exceeding strength of her virtue, her flesh was so subdued that she did not feel this conflict. This, however, would seem to be said without reason, for since we believe the Blessed Virgin to have been altogether immune from the inclination of the fomes on account of the perfection of her sanctification, it is wicked to suppose that there was in her any conflict with the flesh, since such conflict is only from the inclination of the fomes, nor can temptation from the flesh be without sin, as declared by a gloss [1] on 2 Cor. 12:7, "There was given me a sting of my flesh." Hence we must say that she has an aureole properly speaking, so as to be conformed in this to those other members of the Church in whom virginity is found; and although she had no conflict by reason of the temptation which is of the flesh, she had the temptation which is of the enemy, who feared not even Christ (Matt. 4).

Reply Obj. 3. The aureole is not due to virginity except as adding some excellence to the other degrees of continence. If Adam had not sinned, virginity would have had no perfection over conjugal continence, since in that case marriage would have been honourable, and the marriage-bed unsullied, for it would not have been dishonoured by lust; hence virginity would not then have been observed, nor would an aureole have been due to it. But the condition of human nature being changed, virginity has a special beauty of its own, and consequently a special reward is assigned to it. During the time of the Mosaic law, when the worship of God was to be continued by means of the carnal act, it was not altogether praiseworthy to abstain from carnal intercourse; therefore no special reward would be given for such a purpose unless it came from a divine inspiration, as is believed to have been the case with Jeremiah and Elias, of whose marriage we do not read. [2]

Reply Obj. 4. If a virgin is violated, she does not forfeit the aureole, provided she retain unfailingly the purpose of observing perpetual virginity, and in no way consent to the act. Nor does she forfeit virginity thereby; and this is maintained whether she be violated for the faith, or for any other cause whatever. But if she suffer this for the faith, this will count to her for merit, and will be a kind of martyrdom. Therefore Lucy said: "If thou causest me to be violated against my will, my chastity will receive a double crown"; [3] not that she has two aureoles of virginity, but that she will receive a double reward, one for observing virginity, the other for the outrage she has suffered. Even supposing that one thus violated should conceive, she would not for that reason forfeit her virginity; nor would she be equal to Christ’s mother, in whom there was integrity of the flesh together with integrity of the mind.

Reply Obj. 5. Virginity is inborn in us as to that which is material in virginity, but the purpose of observing perpetual incorruption, from which virginity derives its merit, is not inborn, but comes from the gift of grace.

Reply Obj. 6. The sixtyfold fruit is due, not to every widow, but only to those who retain the purpose of remaining widows, even though they do not make it the matter of a vow, even as we have said in regard to virginity.

Reply Obj. 7. If cold-blooded persons and eunuchs have the will to observe perpetual incorruption even though they were capable of sexual intercourse, they must be called virgins and merit the aureole, for they make a virtue of necessity. If, on the other hand, they have the will to marry if they could, they do not merit the aureole. Hence Augustine says (*De Sancta Virginitate*, xxiv): [4] "For those like eunuchs whose bodies are so formed that they are unable to beget, it suffices when they become Christians and keep the commandments of God, that they have a mind to have a wife if they could, in order to rank with the faithful who are married."

## Article 6. Whether an Aureole Is Due to Martyrs?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that an aureole is not due to martyrs.

Objection 1. For an aureole is a reward given for works of supererogation, and therefore Bede commenting on Exod. 25:25, "Thou shalt also make another . . . crown," says: [1] "This may be rightly referred to the reward of those who by freely choosing a more perfect life go beyond the general commandments." But to die for confessing the faith is sometimes an obligation, and not a work of supererogation, as appears from the words of Rom. 10:10, "With the heart, we believe unto justice, but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." Therefore an aureole is not always due to martyrdom.

Objection 2. Further, According to Gregory [2] "the freer the service, the more acceptable it is." Now martyrdom has a minimum of freedom, since it is a punishment inflicted by another person with force. Therefore an aureole is not due to martyrdom, since it is accorded to surpassing merit.

Objection 3. Further, Martyrdom consists not only in suffering death externally, but also in the interior act of the will; therefore Bernard in a sermon on the Holy Innocents [3] distinguishes three kinds of martyr,—in will and not in death, as John; in both will and death, as Stephen; in death and not in will, as the Innocents. Accordingly if an aureole were due to martyrdom, it would be due to voluntary rather than external martyrdom, since merit proceeds from will. Yet such is not the case. Therefore an aureole is not due to martyrdom.

Objection 4. Further, Bodily suffering is less than mental, which consists of internal sorrow and afflictions of soul. But internal suffering is also a kind of martyrdom; therefore Jerome says in a sermon on the Assumption: [4] "I should say rightly that the Mother of God was both virgin and martyr, although she ended her days in peace; thus: 'Thine own soul a sword hath pierced'"—namely for her Son’s death. Since then no aureole corresponds to interior sorrow, neither should one correspond to outward suffering.

Objection 5. Further, Penance itself is a kind of martyrdom, and so Gregory says (*Hom. iii in Ev.*): [5] "Although persecution has ceased to offer the opportunity, yet the peace we enjoy is not without its martyrdom, since even if we no longer yield the life of the body to the sword, yet do we slay fleshly desires in the soul with the sword of the spirit." But no aureole is due to penance which consists in external works. Neither therefore is an aureole due to every external martyrdom.

Objection 6. Further, An aureole is not due to an unlawful work. Now it is unlawful to lay hands on oneself, as Augustine declares, [6] and yet the Church celebrates the martyrdom of some who laid hands upon themselves in order to escape the fury of tyrants, as in the case of certain women at Antioch (Eusebius, *Eccles. Hist.* viii, 12). [7] Therefore an aureole is not always due to martyrdom.

Objection 7. Further, It happens at times that a person is wounded for the faith, and survives for some time. Now it is clear that such a one is a martyr, and yet it seems an aureole is not due to him, since his conflict did not last until death. Therefore an aureole is not always due to martyrdom.

Objection 8. Further, Some suffer more from the loss of temporal goods than from the affliction even of their own body, and this is shown by their bearing many afflictions for the sake of gain. Therefore if they are despoiled of their temporal goods for Christ’s sake they would seem to be martyrs, and yet an aureole is not apparently due to them. Therefore the same conclusion follows as before.

Objection 9. Further, A martyr would seem to be no other than one who dies for the faith, and so Isidore says (*Etym.* vii, 11): [8] "They are called martyrs in Greek, witnesses in Latin, because they suffered in order to bear witness to Christ, and strove unto death for the truth." Now there are virtues more excellent than faith, such as justice, charity, and so forth, since these cannot be without grace, and yet no aureole is due to them. Therefore it seems neither is an aureole due to martyrdom.

Objection 10. Further, Even as the truth of faith is from God, so is all other truth, as Ambrose declares, [1] since "every truth by whomsoever uttered is from the Holy Ghost." Therefore if an aureole is due to one who suffers death for the truth of faith, in like manner it is also due to those who suffer death for any other virtue; and yet apparently this is not the case.

Objection 11. Further, The common good is greater than the good of the individual. Now if a man die in a just war in order to save his country, an aureole is not due to him. Therefore even though he be put to death in order to keep the faith that is in him, no aureole is due to him; and consequently the same conclusion follows as above.

Objection 12. Further, All merit proceeds from free choice. Yet the Church celebrates the martyrdom of some who had not the use of free choice. Therefore they did not merit an aureole; and consequently an aureole is not due to all martyrs.

On the contrary, Augustine says (*De Sancta Virginitate*, xlvi): [2] "No one, I think, would dare prefer virginity to martyrdom." Now an aureole is due to virginity, and consequently also to martyrdom.

Further, The crown is due to one who has striven. But in martyrdom the strife presents a special difficulty. Therefore a special aureole is due to martyrdom.

I answer that, Just as in the spirit there is a conflict with the internal concupiscences, so is there in man a conflict with the passion that is inflicted from without. Therefore, just as a special crown, which we call an aureole, is due to the most perfect victory by which we triumph over the concupiscences of the flesh, in a word, to virginity, so too an aureole is due to the most perfect victory that is won against external assaults.

Now the most perfect victory over passion caused from without is considered from two points of view. First from the greatness of the passion. Now among all passions inflicted from without, death holds the first place, just as sexual concupiscences are chief among internal passions. Consequently, when a man conquers death and things directed to death, his is a most perfect victory. Secondly, the perfection of victory is considered from the point of view of the motive of conflict, when, namely, a man strives for the most honourable cause, which is Christ Himself.

Both these things are to be found in martyrdom, which is death suffered for Christ’s sake; for it is not the pain but the cause that makes the martyr. Consequently an aureole is due to martyrdom as well as to virginity.

Reply Obj. 1. To suffer death for Christ’s sake is, absolutely speaking, a work of supererogation, since every one is not bound to confess his faith in the face of a persecutor; yet in certain cases it is necessary for salvation, when, that is, a person is seized by a persecutor and interrogated as to his faith which he is then bound to confess. Nor does it follow that he does not merit an aureole. For an aureole is due to a work of supererogation, not as such, but as having a certain perfection. Therefore so long as this perfection remains, even though the supererogation cease, one merits the aureole.

Reply Obj. 2. A reward is due to martyrdom, not in respect to the exterior infliction, but because it is suffered voluntarily, since we merit only through that which is in us. And the more that which one suffers voluntarily is difficult and naturally contrary to the will, the more is the will that suffers it for Christ’s sake shown to be firmly established in Christ, and consequently a higher reward is due to him.

Reply Obj. 3. There are certain acts which, in their very selves, contain intense pleasure or difficulty, and in such the act always adds to the character of merit or demerit, since in the performance of the act, the will, on account of the aforesaid intensity, must undergo a change from the state in which it was before. Consequently, other things being equal, one who performs an act of lust sins more than one who merely consents in the act, because in the very act the will is increased. In like manner since in the act of suffering martyrdom there is a very great difficulty, the will to suffer martyrdom does not reach the degree of merit due to actual martyrdom by reason of its difficulty; although indeed it may possibly attain to a higher reward if we consider the root of merit, since the will of one man to suffer martyrdom may possibly proceed from a greater charity than another man’s act of martyrdom. Hence one who is willing to be a martyr may by his will merit an essential reward equal to or greater than that which is due to an actual martyr. But the aureole is due to the difficulty inherent to the conflict itself of martyrdom, and so it is not due to those who are martyrs only in will.

Reply Obj. 4. Just as pleasures of touch, which are the matter of temperance, hold the chief place among all pleasures both internal and external, so pains of touch surpass all other pains. Consequently an aureole is due to the difficulty of suffering pains of touch, for instance, from blows and so forth, rather than to the difficulty of bearing internal sufferings, by reason of which, however, one is not properly called a martyr, except by a kind of comparison. It is in this sense that Jerome speaks.

Reply Obj. 5. The sufferings of penance are not a martyrdom properly speaking, because they do not consist in things directed to the causing of death, since they are directed merely to the taming of the flesh; and if any one go beyond this measure, such afflictions will be deserving of blame. However such afflictions are spoken of as a martyrdom by a kind of comparison, and they surpass the sufferings of martyrdom in duration but not in intensity.

Reply Obj. 6. According to Augustine [1] it is lawful to no one to lay hands on himself for any reason whatever unless, perhaps it be done by divine impulse as an example of fortitude that others may despise death. Those to whom the objection refers are believed to have brought death on themselves by divine stirring, and for this reason the Church celebrates their martyrdom.

Reply Obj. 7. If any one receive a mortal wound for the faith and survive, without doubt he merits the aureole, as appears in the case of blessed Cecilia who survived for three days, [2] and many martyrs who died in prison. [3] But, even if the wound he receives is not mortal, yet is the occasion of his dying, he is believed to merit the aureole (although some say that he does not merit the aureole if he happens to die through his own carelessness or neglect). For this neglect would not have occasioned his death except on the supposition of the wound which he received for the faith, and consequently this wound previously received for the faith is the original occasion of his death, so that he would not seem to lose the aureole for that reason, unless his neglect were such as to involve a mortal sin, which would deprive him of both aurea and aureole. If, however, by some chance or other he were not to die of the mortal wound, or again if the wounds received were not mortal, and he were to die while in prison, he would still merit the aureole. Hence the martyrdom of some saints is celebrated in the Church because they died in prison, having been wounded long before, as in the case of Pope Marcellus. [4]

Accordingly in whatever way suffering for Christ’s sake be continued unto death, whether death ensue or not, a man becomes a martyr and merits the aureole. If, however, it be not continued unto death, this is not a reason for calling a person a martyr, as in the case of the blessed Sylvester, whose feast the Church does not solemnize as a martyr’s, since he ended his days in peace, although previously he had undergone certain sufferings.

Reply Obj. 8. Even as temperance is not about pleasures of money, honours, and the like, but only about pleasures of touch as being the principal of all, so fortitude is about dangers of death as being the greatest of all. [5] Consequently the aureole is due to such injuries only as are inflicted on a person’s own body and are of a nature to cause death. Accordingly whether a person lose his temporal possessions, or his good name, or anything else of the kind, for Christ’s sake, he does not for that reason become a martyr, nor merit the aureole. Nor is it possible in an ordered way to love external things more than one’s body, and disordered love does not help one to merit an aureole; nor again can sorrow for the loss of corporeal things be equal to the sorrow for the slaying of the body and other like things.

Reply Obj. 9. The sufficient motive for martyrdom is not only confession of the faith, but any other virtue, not civic but infused, that has Christ for its end. For one becomes a witness of Christ by any virtuous act, in so far as the works which Christ perfects in us bear witness to His goodness. Hence some virgins were slain for virginity which they desired to keep, for instance blessed Agnes and others whose martyrdom is celebrated by the Church. [6]

Reply Obj. 10. The truth of faith has Christ for end and object, and therefore its confession if suffering be added to it, merits an aureole, not only on the part of the end but also on the part of the matter. But the confession of any other truth is not a sufficient motive for martyrdom by reason of its matter, but only on the part of the end; for instance if a person were willing to be slain for Christ’s sake rather than sin against Him by telling any lie whatever.

Reply Obj. 11. The uncreated good surpasses all created good. Hence any created end, whether it be the common or a private good, cannot confer so great a goodness on an act as can the uncreated end, when, that is, an act is done for God’s sake. Hence when a person dies for the common good without referring it to Christ, he will not merit the aureole; but if he refer it to Christ he will merit the aureole and he will be a martyr; for instance if he defends his country from the attack of an enemy who designs to corrupt the faith of Christ, and suffers death in that defence.

Reply Obj. 12. Some say that the use of reason was by the divine power accelerated in the Innocents slain for Christ’s sake, even as in John the Baptist while yet in his mother’s womb, and in that case they were truly martyrs in both act and will, and have the aureole. Others say, however, that they were martyrs in act only and not in will; and this seems to be the opinion of Bernard, who distinguishes three kinds of martyrs, as stated above (obj. 3). In this case the Innocents, even as they do not fulfill all the conditions of martyrdom, and yet are martyrs in a sense, in that they died for Christ, so too they have the aureole, not in all its perfection, but by a kind of participation, in so far as they rejoice in having been slain in Christ’s service; thus it was stated above (a. 5) in reference to baptized children, that they will have a certain joy in their innocence and carnal integrity.

## Article 7. Whether an Aureole Is Due to Doctors?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that an aureole is not due to doctors.

Objection 1. For every reward to be had in the life to come will correspond to some act of virtue. But preaching or teaching is not the act of a virtue. Therefore an aureole is not due to teaching or preaching.

Objection 2. Further, Teaching and preaching are the result of studying and being taught. Now the things that are rewarded in the future life are not acquired by a man’s study, since we merit not by our natural and acquired gifts. Therefore no aureole will be merited in the future life for teaching and preaching.

Objection 3. Further, Exaltation in the life to come corresponds to humiliation in the present life, because "he that humbleth himself shall be exalted" (Matt. 23:12). But there is no humiliation in teaching and preaching; in fact they are occasions of pride, for a gloss on Matt. 4:5, "Then the devil took Him up," says [1] that the devil deceives many who are puffed up with the honour of the master’s chair. Therefore it would seem that an aureole is not due to preaching and teaching.

On the contrary, A gloss on Eph. 1:18-19, "That you may know . . . what is the exceeding greatness," etc., says: [2] "The holy doctors will have an increase of glory above that which all have in common." Therefore, etc.

Further, A gloss on Cant. 8:12, "My vineyard is before me," says: [3] "He describes the peculiar reward which He has prepared for His doctors." Therefore doctors will have a peculiar reward, and we call this an aureole.

I answer that, Just as by virginity and martyrdom a person wins a most perfect victory over the flesh and the world, so is a most perfect victory gained over the devil when a person not only refuses to yield to the devil’s assaults, but also drives him out, not from himself alone, but from others also. Now this is done by preaching and teaching, and so an aureole is due to preaching and teaching, even as to virginity and martyrdom. Nor can we admit, as some affirm, that it is due to prelates only, who are able to preach and teach by virtue of their office, but it is due to all whosoever exercise this act lawfully. Nor is it due to prelates, although they have the office of preaching, unless they actually preach, since a crown is due not to the habit, but to the actual strife, according to 2 Tim. 2:5, "He . . . shall not be (Vulg.,—is not) crowned, except he strive lawfully."

Reply Obj. 1. Preaching and teaching are acts of a virtue, namely mercy, and therefore they are reckoned among the spiritual alms-deeds.

Reply Obj. 2. Although ability to preach and teach is sometimes the outcome of study, the practice of teaching comes from the will, which is informed with charity infused by God; and thus its act can be meritorious.

Reply Obj. 3. Exaltation in this life does not lessen the reward of the other life, except for him who seeks his own glory from that exaltation; moreover he who turns that exaltation to the profit of others acquires thereby a reward for himself. Still, when it is stated that an aureole is due to teaching, this is to be understood of the teaching of things pertaining to salvation, by which teaching the devil is expelled from men’s hearts, as by a kind of spiritual weapon, of which it is said (2 Cor. 10:4):

### Article 8. Whether an Aureole is Due to Christ?

We proceed thus to the Eighth Article: It would seem that an aureole is due to Christ.

Objection 1. For an aureole is due to virginity, martyrdom, and teaching. Now these three were pre-eminently in Christ. Therefore an aureole is especially due to Him.

Obj. 2. Further, Whatever is most perfect in human things must be especially ascribed to Christ. Now an aureole is due as the reward of most excellent merits. Therefore it is also due to Christ.

Obj. 3. Further, Cyprian says (*De Habit. Virg.*)¹ that “virginity bears a likeness to God.” Therefore the exemplar of virginity is in God. Therefore it would seem that an aureole is due to Christ even as God.

On the contrary, An aureole is described as joy in being conformed to Christ. Now no one is conformed or likened to himself, as the Philosopher says.² Therefore an aureole is not due to Christ.

Further, Christ's reward was never increased. Now Christ had no aureole from the moment of His conception, since then He had never fought. Therefore He never had an aureole afterwards.

I answer that, There are two opinions on this point. For some say that Christ has an aureole in its strict sense, seeing that in Him there is both conflict and victory, and consequently a crown in its proper acceptation. But if we consider the question carefully, although the notion of *aurea* or crown is becoming to Christ, the notion of aureole is not. For from the very fact that aureole is a diminutive term it follows that it denotes something possessed by participation and not in its fulness. Therefore an aureole is becoming to those who participate in the perfect victory by imitating Him in Whom the fulness of perfect victory is realised. And therefore, since in Christ the notion of victory is found chiefly and fully, for by His victory others are made victors,—as shown by the words of John 16. 33, *Have confidence, I have overcome the world*, and Apoc. 5. 5, *Behold the lion of the tribe of Juda . . . hath prevailed*,—it is not fitting for Christ to have an aureole, but to have something from which all aureoles are derived. Hence it is written (Apoc. 3. 21): *To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with Me in My throne, as I also have overcome, and am set down in My Father’s throne* (*Vulg.*,—*With My Father in His throne*). Therefore we must say with others that although there is nothing of the nature of an aureole in Christ, there is nevertheless something more excellent than any aureole.

Reply Obj. 1. Christ was most truly virgin, martyr, and doctor; yet the corresponding accidental reward in Christ is a negligible quantity in comparison with the greatness of His essential reward. Hence He has not an aureole in its proper sense.

Reply Obj. 2. Although the aureole is due to a most perfect work, yet with regard to us, so far as it is a diminutive term, it denotes the participation of a perfection derived from one in whom that perfection is found in its fulness. Accordingly it implies a certain inferiority, and thus it is not found in Christ in Whom is the fulness of every perfection.

Reply Obj. 3. Although in some way virginity has its exemplar in God, that exemplar is not homogeneous. For the incorruption of God, which virginity imitates, is not in God in the same way as in a virgin.

### Article 9. Whether an Aureole Is Due to the Angels?

We proceed thus to the Ninth Article: It would seem that an aureole is due to the angels.

Objection 1. For Jerome (*Serm. de Assump.*)³ speaking of virginity says: “To live without the flesh while living in the flesh is to live as an angel rather than as a man”; and a gloss on 1 Cor. 7. 26, *For the present necessity*, says⁴ that “virginity is the portion of the angels.” Since then an aureole corresponds to virginity, it would seem due to the angels.

Obj. 2. Further, Incorruption of the spirit is more excellent than incorruption of the flesh. Now there is incorruption of spirit in the angels, since they never sinned. Therefore an aureole is due to them rather than to men incorrupt in the flesh and who have sinned at some time.

Obj. 3. Further, An aureole is due to teaching. Now angels teach us by cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting us, as Dionysius says (*Hier. Eccles.* vi, 10).⁵ Therefore at least the aureole of doctors is due to them.

On the contrary, It is written (2 Tim. 2. 5): *He . . . shall not be* (*Vulg.*,—*is not*) *crowned, except he strive lawfully*. But there is no conflict in the angels. Therefore an aureole is not due to them.

Further, An aureole is not due to an act that is not performed through the body; therefore it is not due to lovers of virginity, martyrdom, or teaching, if they do not practise them outwardly. But angels are incorporeal spirits. Therefore they have no aureole.

I answer that, An aureole is not due to the angels. The reason of this is that an aureole, properly speaking, corresponds to some perfection of surpassing merit. Now those things which make for perfect merit in man are connatural to angels, or belong to their state in general, or to their essential reward. Therefore the angels have not an aureole in the same sense as an aureole is due to men.

Reply Obj. 1. Virginity is said to be an angelic life, in so far as virgins imitate by grace what angels have by nature. For it is not owing to a virtue that angels abstain altogether from pleasures of the flesh, since they are incapable of such pleasures.

Reply Obj. 2. Perpetual incorruption of the spirit in the angels merits their essential reward, because it is necessary for their salvation, since in them recovery is impossible after they have fallen.

Reply Obj. 3. The acts whereby the angels teach us belong to their glory and their common state; therefore they do not thereby merit an aureole.

### Article 10. Whether an Aureole Is Also Due to the Body?

We proceed thus to the Tenth Article: It would seem that an aureole is also due to the body.

Objection 1. For the essential reward is greater than the accidental. But the dowries which belong to the essential reward are not only in the soul but also in the body. Therefore there is also an aureole which pertains to the accidental reward.

Obj. 2. Further, Punishment in soul and body corresponds to sin committed through the body. Therefore a reward both in soul and in body is due to merit gained through the body. But the aureole is merited through works of the body. Therefore an aureole is also due to the body.

Obj. 3. Further, A certain fulness of virtue will shine forth in the bodies of martyrs, and will be seen in their bodily scars; therefore Augustine says:⁶ “We feel an indescribable love for the blessed martyrs so as to desire to see in that kingdom the scars of the wounds in their bodies, which they bore for Christ’s name. Perhaps indeed we shall see them, for this will not make them less comely, but more glorious. A certain beauty will shine in them, a beauty, though in the body, yet not of the body but of virtue.” Therefore it would seem that the martyr’s aureole is also in his body; and in like manner the aureoles of others.

On the contrary, The souls now in heaven have aureoles, and yet they have no body. Therefore the proper subject of an aureole is the soul and not the body.

Further, All merit is from the soul. Therefore the whole reward should be in the soul.

I answer that, Properly speaking the aureole is in the mind, since it is joy in the works to which an aureole is due. But even as from the joy in the essential reward, which is the *aurea*, there results a certain comeliness in the body, which is the glory of the body, so from the joy in the aureole there results a certain bodily comeliness, so that the aureole is chiefly in the mind, but by a kind of overflow it shines forth in the body.

This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. It must be observed, however, that the beauty of the scars which will appear in the bodies of the martyrs cannot be called an aureole, since some of the martyrs will have an aureole in which such scars will not appear, for instance those who were put to death by drowning, starvation, or the squalor of prison.

### Article 11. Whether Three Aureoles Are Fittingly Assigned, Those of Virgins, of Martyrs, and of Doctors?

We proceed thus to the Eleventh Article: It would seem that the three aureoles of virgins, martyrs, and doctors are unfittingly assigned.

Objection 1. For the aureole of martyrs corresponds to their virtue of fortitude, the aureole of virgins to the virtue of temperance, and the aureole of doctors to the virtue of prudence. Therefore it seems that there should be a fourth aureole corresponding to the virtue of justice.

Obj. 2. Further, A gloss on Exod. 25. 25: *A polished crown, etc.*, says⁷ that “a golden (*aurea*) crown is added, when the Gospel promises eternal life to those who keep the commandments: ‘*If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments*’ (Matt. 19. 17). To this is added the little golden crown (*aureola*) when it is said: ‘*If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor*’ ” (*ibid.* 21). Therefore an aureole is due to poverty.

Obj. 3. Further, A man subjects himself wholly to God by the vow of obedience; therefore the greatest perfection consists in the vow of obedience. Therefore it would seem that an aureole is due to obedience.

Obj. 4. Further, There are also many other works of supererogation in which one will rejoice in the life to come. Therefore there are many aureoles besides the above three.

Obj. 5. Further, Just as a man spreads the faith by preaching and teaching, so does he by publishing written works. Therefore a fourth aureole is due to those who do this.

I answer that, An aureole is an exceptional reward corresponding to an exceptional victory; therefore the three aureoles are assigned in accordance with the exceptional victories in the three conflicts which beset every man. For in the conflict with the flesh, he above all wins the victory who abstains altogether from sexual pleasures which are the chief of this kind; and such is a virgin. Therefore an aureole is due to virginity. In the conflict with the world, the chief victory is to suffer the world’s persecution even until death. Therefore the second aureole is due to martyrs who win the victory in this battle. In the conflict with the devil, the chief victory is to expel the enemy not only from oneself but also from the hearts of others; this is done by teaching and preaching, and consequently the third aureole is due to doctors and preachers.

Some, however, distinguish the three aureoles in accordance with the three powers of the soul, by saying that the three aureoles correspond to the three chief acts of the soul’s three highest powers. For the act of the rational power is to publish the truth of faith even to others, and to this act the aureole of doctors is due; the highest act of the irascible power is to overcome even death for Christ’s sake, and to this act the aureole of martyrs is due; and the highest act of the concupiscible power is to abstain altogether from the greatest carnal pleasures, and to this act the aureole of virgins is due.

Others again, distinguish the three aureoles in accordance with those things whereby we are most excellently conformed to Christ. For He was the mediator between the Father and the world. Hence He was a doctor, by manifesting to the world the truth which He had received from the Father; He was a martyr, by suffering the persecution of the world; and He was a virgin, by His personal purity. Therefore doctors, martyrs and virgins are most perfectly conformed to Him, and for this reason an aureole is due to them.

Reply Obj. 1. There is no conflict to be observed in the act of justice as in the acts of the other virtues. Nor is it true that to teach is an act of prudence; in fact rather is it an act of charity or mercy,—in so far as it is by such habits that we are inclined to the practice of such an act,—or again of wisdom, as directing it.

We may also reply, with others, that justice embraces all the virtues, and therefore a special aureole is not due to it.

Reply Obj. 2. Although poverty is a work of perfection, it does not take the highest place in a spiritual conflict, because the love of temporal goods assails a man less than carnal concupiscence or persecution whereby his own body is broken. Hence an aureole is not due to poverty, but judicial power is due to it, by reason of the humiliation consequent upon poverty. The gloss quoted takes aureole in the broad sense for any reward given for excellent merit.

We reply in the same way to the Third and Fourth Objections.

Reply Obj. 5. An aureole is due to those who commit the sacred doctrine to writing, but it is not distinct from the aureole of doctors, since the compiling of writing is a way of teaching.

### Article 12. Whether the Virgin's Aureole Is the Greatest of All?

We proceed thus to the Twelfth Article: It would seem that the virgin’s aureole is the greatest of all.

Objection 1. For it is said of virgins (Apoc. 14. 4) that *they follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth*, and (*ibid.* 3) that *no other man could say the canticle which the virgins sang*. Therefore virgins have the most excellent aureole.

Obj. 2. Further, Cyprian (*De Habit. Virg.*)⁸ says of virgins that they are “the more illustrious portion of Christ’s flock.” Therefore the greater aureole is due to them.

Obj. 3. Again, it would seem that the martyr’s aureole is the greatest. For Haymo, commenting on Apoc. 14. 3, *No man could say the hymn*, says⁹ that “virgins do not all take precedence of married folk; but only those who in addition to the observance of virginity are by the tortures of their passion on a par with married persons who have suffered martyrdom.” Therefore martyrdom gives virginity its precedence over other states, and consequently a greater aureole is due to virginity.

Obj. 4. Again, it would seem that the greatest aureole is due to doctors. For the Church militant is modelled after the Church triumphant. Now in the Church militant the greatest honour is due to doctors (1 Tim. 5. 17): *Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine*. Therefore a greater aureole is due to them in the Church triumphant.

I answer that, Precedence of one aureole over another may be considered from two standpoints. First, from the point of view of the conflicts, that aureole being considered greater which is due to the more strenuous battle. Looking at it thus the martyr’s aureole takes precedence of the others in one way, and the virgin’s in another. For the martyr’s battle is more strenuous in itself, and more intensely painful, while the conflict with the flesh is fraught with greater danger, since it is more lasting and threatens us at closer quarters. Secondly, from the point of view of the things about which the battle is fought, and thus the doctor’s aureole takes precedence of all others, since this conflict is about intelligible goods, while the other conflicts are about sensible passions. Nevertheless, the precedence that is considered in view of the conflict is more essential to the aureole, since the aureole, according to its proper character, regards the victory and the battle, and the difficulty of fighting which is viewed from the standpoint of the battle is of greater importance than that which is considered from our standpoint through the conflict being at closer quarters. Therefore the martyr’s aureole is the greatest absolutely of all; for this reason a gloss on Matt. 5. 10, says¹⁰ that “all the other beatitudes are perfected in the eighth, which refers to the martyrs,” namely, *Blessed are they that suffer persecution*. For this reason, too, the Church in enumerating the saints together places the martyrs before the doctors and virgins. Yet nothing hinders the other aureoles from being more excellent in some particular way. And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

### Article 13. Whether One Person Has an Aureole more Excellently Than Another Person?

We proceed thus to the Thirteenth Article: It would seem that one person has not the aureole either of virginity, or of martyrdom, or of doctrine more perfectly than another person.

Objection 1. For things which have reached their term are not subject to intension or lessening. Now the aureole is due to works which have reached their term of perfection. Therefore an aureole is not subject to intension or lessening.

Obj. 2. Further, Virginity is not subject to being more or less, since it denotes a kind of privation, and privations are not subject to intension or lessening. Therefore neither does the reward of virginity, the virgin’s aureole, that is, receive intension or lessening.

On the contrary, The aureole is added to the *aurea*. But the *aurea* is more intense in one than in another. Therefore the aureole is also.

I answer that, Since merit is somewhat the cause of reward, rewards must be diversified according as merits are diversified, for the intension or lessening of a thing follows from the intension or lessening of its cause. Now the merit of the aureole may be greater or lesser. Therefore the aureole may also be greater or lesser.

We must observe, however, that the merit of an aureole may be intensified in two ways: first, on the part of its cause, secondly on the part of the work. For there may happen to be two persons, one of whom, out of lesser charity, suffers greater torments of martyrdom, or is more constant in preaching, or again withdraws himself more from carnal pleasures. Accordingly, intension not of the aureole but of the *aurea* corresponds to the intension of merit derived from its root, while intension of the aureole corresponds to intension of merit derived from the kind of act. Consequently it is possible for one who merits less in martyrdom as to his essential reward to receive a greater aureole for his martyrdom.

Reply Obj. 1. The merits to which an aureole is due do not reach the term of their perfection absolutely, but according to their species, even as fire is specifically the most subtle of bodies. Hence nothing hinders one aureole being more excellent than another, even as one fire is more subtle than another.

Reply Obj. 2. The virginity of one may be greater than the virginity of another by reason of a greater withdrawal from that which is contrary to virginity, so that virginity is stated to be greater in one who avoids more the occasions of corruption. For in this way privations may increase, as when a man is said to be more blind if he is removed further from the possession of sight.

## QUESTION XCVII
### Of the punishment of the damned (In Seven Articles)

In due sequence we must consider those things that concern the damned after the judgment:

1.  The punishment of the damned, and the fire by which their bodies will be tormented;
2.  matters relating to their will and intellect (Q. XCVIII);
3.  God's justice and mercy in regard to the damned (Q. XCIX).

Under the first head there are seven points of inquiry:
1.  Whether in hell the damned are tormented with the sole punishment of fire?
2.  Whether the worm by which they are tormented is corporeal?
3.  Whether their weeping is corporeal?
4.  Whether their darkness is material?
5.  Whether the fire whereby they are tormented is corporeal?
6.  Whether it is of the same species as our fire?
7.  Whether this fire is beneath the earth?

### Article 1. Whether in Hell the Damned Are Tormented By the Sole Punishment of Fire?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that in hell the damned are tormented by the sole punishment of fire.

Objection 1. For in Matt. 25. 41, where their condemnation is declared, mention is made of fire only, in the words: *Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire*.

Obj. 2. Further, Even as the punishment of purgatory is due to venial sin, so is the punishment of hell due to mortal sin. Now no other punishment but that of fire is stated to be in purgatory, as appears from the words of 1 Cor. 3. 13: *The fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is*. Therefore neither in hell will there be a punishment other than of fire.

Obj. 3. Further, Variety of punishment affords a respite, as when one passes from heat to cold. But we can admit no respite in the damned. Therefore there will not be various punishments, but that of fire alone.

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 10. 7): *Fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup*.

Further, It is written (Job 24. 19): *Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat*.

I answer that, According to Basil (*Hom. i in Ps. 28*)¹¹, at the final cleansing of the world there will be a separation of the elements, whatever is pure and noble remaining above for the glory of the blessed, and whatever is ignoble and sordid being cast down for the punishment of the damned, so that just as every creature will be to the blessed a matter of joy, so will all the elements conduce to the torture of the damned, according to Wis. 5. 21, *the whole world will fight with Him against the unwise*. This is also becoming to Divine justice, that whereas they departed from One by sin, and placed their end in material things which are many and various, so should they be tormented in many ways and from many sources.

Reply Obj. 1. It is because fire is most painful, through its abundance of active force, that the name of fire is given to any torment if it be intense.

Reply Obj. 2. The punishment of purgatory is not intended chiefly to torment, but to cleanse; therefore it should be inflicted by fire alone which is above all possessed of cleansing power. But the punishment of the damned is not directed to their cleansing. Consequently the comparison fails.

Reply Obj. 3. The damned will pass from the most intense heat to the most intense cold, without this giving them any respite, because they will suffer from external agencies not by the change of their body from its original natural disposition, and the contrary passion affording a respite by restoring an equable or moderate temperature, as happens now, but by a spiritual action, in the same way as sensible objects act on the senses, being perceived by impressing the organ with their forms according to their spiritual and not their material being.

### Article 2. Whether the Worm of the Damned Is Corporeal?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the worm by which the damned are tormented is corporeal.

Objection 1. For flesh cannot be tormented by a spiritual worm. Now the flesh of the damned will be tormented by a worm: *He will give fire and worms into their flesh* (Judith 16. 21), and: *The vengeance on the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms* (Ecclus. 7. 19). Therefore that worm will be corporeal.

Obj. 2. Further, Augustine says:¹² “Both, namely fire and worm, will be the punishment of the body.” Therefore, etc.

On the contrary, Augustine says:¹³ “The unquenchable fire and the restless worm in the punishment of the damned are explained in various ways by different persons. Some refer both to the body, some, both to the soul; others refer the fire, in the literal sense, to the body, the worm to the soul metaphorically, and this seems the more probable.”

I answer that, After the day of judgment, no animal or mixed body will remain in the renewed world except only the body of man, because the former are not directed to incorruption, nor after that time will there be generation or corruption. Consequently the worm ascribed to the damned must be understood to be not of a corporeal but of a spiritual nature, and this is the remorse of conscience, which is called a worm because it originates from the corruption of sin, and torments the soul, as a corporeal worm born of corruption torments by gnawing.

Reply Obj. 1. The very souls of the damned are called their flesh because they were subject to the flesh. Or we may reply that the flesh will be tormented by the spiritual worm, according as the afflictions of the soul overflow into the body, both here and hereafter.

Reply Obj. 2. Augustine speaks by way of comparison. For he does not wish to assert absolutely that this worm is material, but that it is better to say that both are to be understood materially than that both should be understood only in a spiritual sense, for then the damned would suffer no bodily pain. This is clear to anyone that examines the context of his words in this passage.

### Article 3. Whether the Weeping of the Damned Will Be Corporeal?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that the weeping of the damned will be corporeal.

Objection 1. For a gloss on Luke 13. 28, *There will be weeping*, says¹⁴ that “the weeping with which our Lord threatens the wicked is a proof of the resurrection of the body.” But this would not be the case if that weeping were merely spiritual. Therefore, etc.

Obj. 2. Further, The pain of the punishment corresponds to the pleasure of the sin, according to Apoc. 18. 7: *As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her*. Now sinners had internal and external pleasure in their sin. Therefore they will also have external weeping.

On the contrary, Corporeal weeping results from dissolving into tears. Now there cannot be a continual dissolution from the bodies of the damned, since nothing is restored to them by food; for everything finite is consumed if something be continually taken from it. Therefore the weeping of the damned will not be corporeal.

I answer that, Two things are to be observed in corporeal weeping. One is the resolution of tears: and as to this corporeal weeping cannot be in the damned, since after the day of judgment, the movement of the first movable being at an end, there will be neither generation, nor corruption, nor bodily change, and in the resolution of tears that humour needs to be generated which is shed forth in the shape of tears.

Therefore in this respect it will be impossible for corporeal weeping to be in the damned. The other thing to be observed in corporeal weeping is a certain agitation and disturbance of the head and eyes, and in this respect weeping will be possible in the damned after the resurrection, for the bodies of the damned will be tormented not only from without, but also from within, according as the body is affected at the instance of the soul’s passion towards good or evil. In this sense weeping is a proof of the body’s resurrection, and corresponds to the pleasure of sin, experienced by both soul and body.

This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

## Article 4. Whether the Damned Are in Material Darkness?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that the damned are not in material darkness.

### Objection 1.
For commenting on Job 10:22,
> But everlasting horror dwelleth,
Gregory says (*Moralia, IX, 66*):¹
> Although that fire will give no light for comfort, yet, that it may torment the more it does give light for a purpose, for by the light of its flame the wicked will see their followers whom they have drawn thither from the world.
Therefore the darkness there is not material.

### Obj. 2.
Further, The damned see their own punishment, for this increases their punishment. But nothing is seen without light. Therefore there is no material darkness there.

### Obj. 3.
Further, There the damned will have the power of sight after being reunited to their bodies. But this power would be useless to them unless they see something. Therefore, since nothing is seen unless it be in the light, it would seem that they are not in absolute darkness.

### On the contrary,
It is written (Matthew 22:13):
> Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness.
Commenting on these words Gregory says (*Moralia, IX, 65*):²
> If this fire gave any light, he would by no means be described as cast into exterior darkness.

Further, Basil says (*Homilia I in Psalmum XXVIII, 7*, "The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire"):³ that
> by God’s might the brightness of the fire will be separated from its power of burning, so that its brightness will conduce to the joy of the blessed, and the heat of the flame to the torment of the damned.
Therefore the damned will be in material darkness.

Other points relating to the punishment of the damned have been decided above (Q. 86, Art. 3).⁴ ⁵

I answer that, The disposition of hell will be such as to be adapted to the utmost unhappiness of the damned. Therefore accordingly both light and darkness are there, in so far as they are most conducive to the unhappiness of the damned. Now seeing is in itself pleasant for, as stated in the *Metaphysics*:⁵
> the sense of sight is most valued, because thereby many things are known.
Yet it happens accidentally that seeing is painful, when we see things that are hurtful to us, or displeasing to our will. Consequently in hell the place must be so disposed for seeing as regards light and darkness that nothing be seen clearly, and that only such things be dimly seen as are able to bring anguish to the heart. Therefore, absolutely speaking, the place is dark. Yet by Divine disposition, there is a certain amount of light, as much as suffices for seeing those things which are capable of tormenting the soul. The natural situation of the place is enough for this, since in the centre of the earth, where hell is said to be, fire cannot be otherwise than thick and cloudy, and reeky as it were.

Some hold that this darkness is caused by the massing together of the bodies of the damned, which will so fill the place of hell with their numbers, that no air will remain, so that there will be no translucent body that can be the subject of light and darkness, except the eyes of the damned, which will be darkened utterly.

This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

## Article 5. Whether the Fire of Hell Will Be Corporeal?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that the fire of hell whereby the bodies of the damned will be tormented will not be corporeal.

### Objection 1.
For Damascene says (*De Fide Orthodoxa, IV, 27*):⁶
> The devil, and demons, and his man, namely Antichrist, together with the ungodly and sinners, will be cast into everlasting fire, not material fire, such as that which we have, but such as God knoweth.
Now everything corporeal is material. Therefore the fire of hell will not be corporeal.

### Obj. 2.
Further, The souls of the damned when severed from their bodies are cast into hell fire. But Augustine says (*De Genesi ad Litteram, XII, 32*):⁷
> In my opinion the place to which the soul is committed after death is spiritual and not corporeal.
Therefore, etc.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Corporeal fire in the mode of its action does not follow the mode of guilt in the person who is burnt at the stake, but rather does it follow the mode of humid and dry, for in the same corporeal fire we see both good and wicked suffer. But the fire of hell, in its mode of torture or action, follows the mode of guilt in the person punished; therefore Gregory says (*Dialogues, IV, 43*):⁸
> There is indeed but one hell fire, but it does not torture all sinners equally. For each one will suffer as much pain according as his guilt deserves.
Therefore this fire will not be corporeal.

### On the contrary,
He says (*Dialogues, IV, 29*):⁹
> I doubt not that the fire of hell is corporeal, since it is certain that bodies are tortured there.

Further, It is written (Wisdom 5:21):
> The . . . world shall fight . . . against the unwise.
But the whole world would not fight against the unwise if they were punished with a spiritual and not a corporeal punishment. Therefore they will be punished with a corporeal fire.

I answer that, There have been many opinions about the fire of hell. For some philosophers, as Avicenna,¹⁰ not believing in the resurrection, thought that the soul alone would be punished after death. And as they considered it impossible for the soul, being incorporeal, to be punished with a corporeal fire, they denied that the fire by which the wicked are punished is corporeal, and pretended that all statements as to souls being punished in future after death by any corporeal means are to be taken metaphorically. For just as the joy and happiness of good souls will not be about any corporeal object, but about something spiritual, namely the attainment of their end, so will the torment of the wicked be merely spiritual, in that they will be grieved at being separated from their end, the desire for which is in them by nature. Therefore, just as all descriptions of the soul’s delight after death that seem to denote bodily pleasure,—for instance, that they are refreshed, that they smile, and so forth,—must be taken metaphorically, so also are all such descriptions of the soul’s suffering as seem to imply bodily punishment,—for instance, that they burn in fire, or suffer from the stench, and so forth. For as spiritual pleasure and pain are unknown to the majority, these things need to be declared under the figure of corporeal pleasures and pains, in order that men may be moved the more to the desire or fear of them.

Since, however, in the punishment of the damned there will be not only pain of loss corresponding to the turning away that was in their sin, but also pain of sense corresponding to the conversion, it follows that it is not enough to hold the above manner of punishment. For this reason Avicenna himself (*loc. cit.*) added another explanation, by saying that the souls of the wicked are punished after death not by bodies but by likenesses of bodies; just as in a dream it seems to a man that he is suffering various pains on account of such images being in his imagination. Even Augustine seems to hold this kind of punishment (*De Genesi ad Litteram, XII, 32*):¹¹ as is clear from the text.

But this would seem an unreasonable statement. For the imagination is a power that makes use of a bodily organ, so that it is impossible for such visions of the imagination to occur in the soul separated from the body, as in the soul of the dreamer. Therefore Avicenna also (*loc. cit.*), that he might avoid this difficulty, said that the soul separated from the body uses as an organ some part of the heavenly body, to which the human body needs to be conformed, in order to be perfected by the rational soul, which is like the movers of the heavenly body,—thus following somewhat the opinion of certain philosophers of old, who maintained that souls return to the stars that are their compeers.

But this is absolutely absurd according to the Philosopher’s teaching, since the soul uses a definite bodily organ, even as art uses definite instruments, so that it cannot pass from one body to another, as Pythagoras is stated¹² to have maintained.¹³ As to the statement of Augustine we shall say below how it is to be answered (Reply 2).

However, whatever we may say of the fire that torments the separated souls, we must admit that the fire which will torment the bodies of the damned after the resurrection is corporeal, since one cannot fittingly apply a punishment to a body unless that punishment itself be bodily. Therefore Gregory (*Dialogues, IV, 29*):¹⁴ proves the fire of hell to be corporeal from the very fact that the wicked will be cast there after the resurrection. Again Augustine, as quoted in the text of *In Sent.*, IV, d. 44:¹⁵ clearly admits¹⁶ that the fire by which the bodies are tormented is corporeal. And this is the point at issue for the present. We have said elsewhere (Q. 70, Art. 3) how the souls of the damned are punished by this corporeal fire.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Damascene does not absolutely deny that this fire is material, but that it is material as our fire, since it differs from ours in some of its properties. We may also reply that since that fire does not change bodies as to their matter, but acts on them for their punishment by a kind of spiritual action, it is for this reason that it is stated not to be material, not as regards its substance, but as to its punitive effect on bodies and, still more, on souls.

### Reply Obj. 2.
The assertion of Augustine may be taken in this way, that the place whither souls are conveyed after death is described as incorporeal in so far as the soul is there not corporeally, that is as bodies are in a place, but in some other spiritual way, as angels are in a place. Or we may reply that Augustine is expressing an opinion without deciding the point, as he often does in those books.

### Reply Obj. 3.
That fire will be the instrument of Divine justice inflicting punishment. Now an instrument acts not only by its own power and in its own way, but also by the power of the principal agent, and as directed by it. Therefore although fire is not able, of its own power, to torture certain persons more or less, according to the measure of sin, it is able to do so nevertheless in so far as its action is regulated by the ordering of Divine justice; even so the fire of the furnace is regulated by the forethought of the smith, according as the effect of his art requires.

## Article 6. Whether the Fire of Hell Is of the Same Species As Ours?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that this fire is not of the same species as the corporeal fire which we see.

### Objection 1.
For Augustine says:¹⁷ and is quoted in the text:¹⁸
> In my opinion no man knows of what kind is the everlasting fire, unless the Spirit of God has revealed it to anyone.
But all or nearly all know the nature of this fire of ours. Therefore that fire is not of the same species as this.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Gregory commenting on Job 20:26,
> A fire that is not kindled shall devour him,
says (*Moralia, XV, 29*):¹⁹
> Bodily fire needs bodily fuel in order to become fire; neither can it be except by being kindled, nor live unless it be renewed. On the other hand the fire of hell, since it is a bodily fire, and burns in a bodily way the wicked cast therein, is neither kindled by human endeavour, nor kept alive with fuel, but once created endures unquenchably; at one and the same time it needs no kindling, and lacks not heat.
Therefore it is not of the same nature as the fire that we see.

### Obj. 3.
Further, The everlasting and the corruptible differ essentially, since they agree not even in genus, according to the Philosopher:²⁰ But this fire of ours is corruptible, whereas the other is everlasting:
> Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire (Matthew 25:41).
Therefore they are not of the same nature.

### Obj. 4.
Further, It belongs to the nature of this fire of ours to give light. But the fire of hell gives no light; hence the saying of Job 18:5:
> Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished?
Therefore ... as above.

### On the contrary,
According to the Philosopher:²¹
> every water is of the same species as every other water.
Therefore in like manner every fire is of the same species as every other fire.

Further, It is written (Wisdom 11:17):
> By what things a man sinneth by the same also he is tormented.
Now men sin by the sensible things of this world. Therefore it is just that they should be punished by those same things.

I answer that, As stated in the book on *Meteorology*:²² fire has other bodies for its matter, for the reason that of all the elements it has the greatest power of action. Hence fire is found under two conditions: in its own matter, as existing in its own sphere, and in a strange matter, whether of earth, as in burning coal, or of air, as in the flame. Under whatever conditions however fire be found, it is always of the same species, so far as the nature of fire is concerned, but there may be a difference of species as to the bodies which are the matter of fire. Therefore flame and burning coal differ specifically, and likewise burning wood and red-hot iron; nor does it signify, as to this particular point, whether they be kindled by force, as in the case of iron, or by a natural intrinsic principle, as happens with sulphur. Accordingly it is clear that the fire of hell is of the same species as the fire we have, so far as the nature of fire is concerned. But whether that fire subsists in its proper matter, or if it subsists in a strange matter, whatever that matter may be, we know not. And in this way it may differ specifically from the fire we have, considered materially. It has, however, certain properties differing from our fire, for instance that it needs no kindling, nor is kept alive by fuel. But the differences do not argue a difference of species as regards the nature of the fire.

### Reply Obj. 1.
Augustine is speaking of that fire with regard to its matter, and not with regard to its nature.

### Reply Obj. 2.
This fire of ours is kept alive with fuel, and is kindled by man, because it is introduced into a foreign matter by art and force. But that other fire needs no fuel to keep it alive, because either it subsists in its own matter, or is in a foreign matter, not by force but by nature from an intrinsic principle. Therefore it is kindled not by man but by God, Who fashioned its nature. This is the meaning of the words of Isaiah (30:33):
> The breath of the Lord is as a torrent of brimstone kindling it.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Even as the bodies of the damned will be of the same species as now, although now they are corruptible, whereas then they will be incorruptible, both by the ordering of Divine justice, and on account of the cessation of the heavenly movement, so is it with the fire of hell by which those bodies will be punished.

### Reply Obj. 4.
To give light does not belong to fire according to any mode of existence, since in its own matter it gives no light; therefore it does not shine in its own sphere according to the philosophers, and in like manner in certain foreign matters it does not shine, as when it is in an opaque earthly substance such as sulphur. The same happens also when its brightness is obscured by thick smoke. Therefore that the fire of hell gives no light is not sufficient proof of its being of a different species.

## Article 7. Whether the Fire of Hell Is Beneath the Earth?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that this fire is not beneath the earth.

### Objection 1.
For it is said of the damned (Job 18:18),
> And God shall remove him out of the globe
(Douay,—world). Therefore the fire whereby the damned will be punished is not beneath the earth but outside the globe.

### Obj. 2.
Further, Nothing violent or accidental can be everlasting. But this fire will be in hell for ever. Therefore it will be there not by force but naturally. Now fire cannot be under the earth save by violence. Therefore the fire of hell is not beneath the earth.

### Obj. 3.
Further, After the day of judgment the bodies of all the damned will be tormented in hell. Now those bodies will fill a place. Consequently, since the multitude of the damned will be very great, for
> the number of fools is infinite
(Ecclesiastes 1:15), the space containing that fire must also be very great. But it would seem unreasonable to say that there is so great a hollow within the earth, since all the parts of the earth naturally tend to the centre. Therefore that fire will not be beneath the earth.

### Obj. 4.
Further,
> By what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented
(Wisdom 11:17). But the wicked have sinned on the earth. Therefore the fire that punishes them should not be under the earth.

### On the contrary,
It is written (Isaiah 14:9):
> Hell below was in an uproar to meet Thee at Thy coming.
Therefore the fire of hell is beneath us.

Further, Gregory says (*Dialogues, IV, 42*):²³
> I see not what hinders us from believing that hell is beneath the earth.

Further, A gloss on Jonah 2:4,
> Thou hast cast me forth . . . into the heart of the sea,
says:²⁴
> that is, into hell,
and in the Gospel (Matthew 12:40) the words
> in the heart of the earth
have the same sense, for as the heart is in the middle of an animal, so is hell supposed to be in the middle of the earth.

I answer that, As Augustine says:²⁵ and he is quoted in the text:²⁶
> I am of opinion that no one knows in what part of the world hell is situated, unless the Spirit of God has revealed this to some one.
Therefore Gregory (*Dialogues, IV, 42*):²⁷ having been questioned on this point answers:
> About this matter I dare not give a rash decision. For some have thought hell to be in some part of the earth’s surface; others think it to be beneath the earth.
He shows the latter opinion to be the more probable for two reasons. First from the very meaning of the word. These are his words:
> If we call it the nether regions (*inferus*), for the reason that it is beneath us (*inferius*), what earth is in relation to heaven, such should be hell in relation to earth.
Secondly, from the words of Apocalypse 5:3:
> No man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book,
where the words “in heaven” refer to the angels, “on earth” to men living in the body, and “under the earth” to souls in hell.

Augustine too (*De Genesi ad Litteram, XII, 34*):²⁸ seems to indicate two reasons for the congruity of hell being under the earth. One is that
> since the souls of the departed sinned through love of the flesh, they should be treated as the dead flesh is accustomed to be treated, by being buried beneath the earth.
The other is that heaviness is to the body what sorrow is to the spirit, and joy (of spirit) is as lightness (of body). Therefore
> just as in reference to the body, all the heavier things are beneath the others, if they are placed in order of gravity, so in reference to the spirit, the lower place is occupied by whatever is more sorrowful;
and thus even as the empyrean is a fitting place for the joy of the elect, so the lowest part of the earth is a fitting place for the sorrow of the damned. Nor does it signify that Augustine (*ibid.*) says that
> hell is stated or believed to be under the earth,
because he withdraws this (*Retractationes, II, 24*):²⁹ where he says:
> I think I should have said that hell is beneath the earth, rather than have given the reason why it is stated or believed to be under the earth.

However, some philosophers have maintained that hell is situated beneath the terrestrial orb, but above the surface of the earth, on that part which is opposite to us. This seems to have been the meaning of Isidore when he asserted that
> the sun and the moon will stop in the place wherein they were created, lest the wicked should enjoy this light in the midst of their torments.
But this is no argument, if we assert that hell is under the earth. We have already stated how these words may be explained (Q. 91, Art. 2).

Pythagoras held³¹ the place of punishment to be in a fiery sphere situated, according to him, in the middle of the whole world, and he called it the prison-house of Jupiter as Aristotle relates:³² It is, however, more in keeping with Scripture to say that it is beneath the earth.

### Reply Obj. 1.
The words of Job,
> God shall remove him out of the globe,
refer to the surface of the earth, that is from this world. This is how Gregory expounds it (*Moralia, XIV, 22*):³³ where he says:
> He is removed from the globe when, at the coming of the heavenly judge, he is taken away from this world wherein he now prides himself in his wickedness.
Nor does globe here signify the universe, as though the place of punishment were outside the whole universe.

### Reply Obj. 2.
Fire continues in that place for all eternity by the ordering of Divine justice, although according to its nature an element cannot last for ever outside its own place, especially if things were to remain in this state of generation and corruption. The fire there will be of the very greatest heat, because its heat will be all gathered together from all parts, through being surrounded on all sides by the cold of the earth.

### Reply Obj. 3.
Hell will never lack sufficient room to admit the bodies of the damned, since
> hell is accounted one of the three things that never are satisfied
(Proverbs 30:15, 16). Nor is it unreasonable that God’s power should maintain within the bowels of the earth a hollow great enough to contain all the bodies of the damned.

### Reply Obj. 4.
It does not follow of necessity that
> by what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented,
except as regards the principal instruments of sin, because man having sinned in soul and body will be punished in both. But it does not follow that a man will be punished in the very place where he sinned, because the place due to the damned is other from that due to wayfarers. We may also reply that these words refer to the punishments inflicted on man on the way, according as each sin has its corresponding punishment, since
> every disordered love is its own punishment,
as Augustine states.³⁴

# QUESTION XCVIII
## OF THE WILL AND INTELLECT OF THE DAMNED
(In Nine Articles)

We must next consider matters pertaining to the will and intellect of the damned. Under this head there are nine points of inquiry:
1.  Whether every act of will in the damned is evil?
2.  Whether they ever repent of the evil they have done?
3.  Whether they would rather not be than be?
4.  Whether they would wish others to be damned?
5.  Whether the wicked hate God?
6.  Whether they can demerit?
7.  Whether they can make use of the knowledge acquired in this life?
8.  Whether they ever think of God?
9.  Whether they see the glory of the blessed?

## Article 1. Whether Every Act of Will in the Damned Is Evil?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that not every act of will in the damned is evil.

### Objection 1.
For according to Dionysius (*De Divinis Nominibus, IV*):³⁵
> the demons desire the good and the best, namely to be, to live, to understand.
Since, then, men who are damned are not worse off than the demons, it would seem that they also can have a good will.

### Obj. 2.
Further, As Dionysius says (*ibid.*):³⁶
> evil is altogether involuntary.
Therefore if the damned will anything, they will it as something good or apparently good. Now a will that is directly ordered to good is itself good. Therefore the damned can have a good will.

### Obj. 3.
Further, Some will be damned who, while in this world, acquired certain habits of virtue, for instance heathens who had civic virtues. Now a will elicits praiseworthy acts by reason of virtuous habits. Therefore there may be praiseworthy acts of the will in some of the damned.

### On the contrary,
An obstinate will can never be inclined except to evil. Now men who are damned will be obstinate even as the demons, Therefore their will can never be good.

Further, As the will of the damned is in relation to evil, so is the will of the blessed in regard to good. But the blessed never have an evil will. Neither therefore have the damned any good will.

I answer that, A twofold will may be considered in the damned, namely the deliberate will and the natural will. Their natural will is theirs not of themselves but of the Author of nature, Who gave nature this inclination which we call the natural will. Therefore since nature remains in them, it follows that the natural will in them can be good. But their deliberate will is theirs of themselves, according as it is in their power to be inclined by their affections to this or that. This will is in them always evil, and this because they are completely turned away from the last end of a right will, nor can a will be good except it be directed to that same end. Hence even though they will some good, they

do not will it well so that their will can be called good on that account.

Reply Objection 1. The words of Dionysius must be understood of the natural will, which is nature’s inclination to some particular good. And yet this natural inclination is corrupted by their wickedness, in so far as this good which they desire naturally is desired by them under certain evil circumstances.

Reply Objection 2. Evil, as evil, does not move the will, but in so far as it is thought to be good. Yet it comes of their wickedness that they esteem that which is evil as though it were good. Hence their will is evil.

Reply Objection 3. The habits of civic virtue do not remain in the separated soul, because those virtues perfect us only in the civic life which will not remain after this life. Even though they remained, they would never come into action, being enchained, as it were, by the obstinacy of the mind.

## Article 2. Whether the Damned Repent of the Evil They Have Done?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that the damned never repent of the evil they have done.

Objection 1. For Bernard says on the *Canticle*1 that “the damned ever consent to the evil they have done.” Therefore they never repent of the sins they have committed.
1 Cf. *De Consideratione*, v, 12 (PL 182, 802); *De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio*, ix (PL 182, 1017); cf. Albert, *In Sententiis*, iv, d. 50, A. 3, *sed contra* 1 (*BO* xxx, 689).

Objection 2. Further, To wish one had not sinned is a good will. But the damned will never have a good will. Therefore the damned will never wish they had not sinned, and thus the same conclusion follows as above.

Objection 3. Further, According to Damascene (*De Fide Orthodoxa* ii, 4),2 “death is to man what their fall was to the angels.” But the angel’s will is irrevocable after his fall, in that he cannot withdraw from the choice whereby he previously sinned. Therefore the damned also cannot repent of the sins committed by them.
2 PG 94, 877.

Objection 4. Further, The wickedness of the damned in hell will be greater than that of sinners in the world. Now in this world some sinners repent not of the sins they have committed, either through blindness of mind, as heretics, or through obstinacy, as those who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things (Prov. 2:14). Therefore, etc.

On the contrary, It is said of the damned (Wisd. 5:3):
> Repenting within themselves (*Vulg.*, — Saying within themselves, repenting).

Further, The Philosopher says3 that “the wicked are full of repentance; for afterwards they are sorry for that in which previously they took pleasure.” Therefore the damned, being most wicked, repent all the more.
3 *Ethics*, ix, 4 (1166b24).

I answer that, A person may repent of sin in two ways: in one way directly, in another way accidentally. He repents of a sin directly who hates sin as such; and he repents accidentally who hates it on account of something connected with it, for instance punishment or something of that kind. Accordingly the wicked will not repent of their sins directly, because consent in the malice of sin will remain in them; but they will repent accidentally, in so far as they will suffer from the punishment inflicted on them for sin.

Reply Objection 1. The damned will wickedness, but shun punishment, and thus accidentally they repent of wickedness committed.

Reply Objection 2. To wish one had not sinned on account of the shamefulness of vice is a good will; but this will not be in the wicked.

Reply Objection 3. It will be possible for the damned to repent of their sins without turning their will away from sin, because in their sins they will shun not what they previously desired, but something else, namely the punishment.

Reply Objection 4. However obstinate men may be in this world, they repent of the sins accidentally if they are punished for them. Thus Augustine says (*Qq. LXXXIII*, qu. 36):1 “We see the most savage beasts are deterred from the greatest pleasures by fear of pain.”
1 PL 40, 25.

## Article 3. Whether the Damned By Right and Deliberate Reason Would Will Not To Be?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem impossible for the damned, by right and deliberate reason, to will not to be.

Objection 1. For Augustine says (*De Libero Arbitrio* iii, 7):2 “Consider how great a good it is to be, since both the happy and the unhappy will it; for to be and yet to be unhappy is a greater thing than not to be at all.”
2 PL 32, 1280.

Objection 2. Further, Augustine argues thus (*ibid.* 8):3 Preference supposes election. But not to be is not a matter of choice since it has not the appearance of good, for it is nothing. Therefore not to be cannot be more desirable to the damned than to be.
3 PL 32, 1281.

Objection 3. Further, The greater evil is the more to be shunned. Now not to be is the greatest evil, since it removes good altogether, so as to leave nothing. Therefore not to be is more to be shunned than to be unhappy; and thus the same conclusion follows as above.

On the contrary, It is written (Apoc. 9:6):
> In those days men . . . shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them.

Further, The unhappiness of the damned surpasses all unhappiness of this world. Now in order to escape the unhappiness of this world, it is desirable to some to die, and so it is written (Ecclus. 41:3-4):
> O death, thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need, and to him whose strength faileth; who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that loseth wisdom (*Vulg.*, — patience).
Much more, therefore, is “not to be” desirable to the damned according to their deliberate reason.

I answer that, Not to be may be considered in two ways. First, in itself, and thus it can in no way be desirable, since it has no aspect of good, but is pure privation of good. Secondly, it may be considered as a relief from a painful life or from some unhappiness, and thus not to be takes on the aspect of good, since “to lack an evil is a kind of good” as the Philosopher says.4 In this way it is better for the damned not to be than to be unhappy. Hence it is said (Matt. 26:24): *It were better for him, if that man had not been born*, and (Jer. 20:14): *Cursed be the day wherein I was born*, where a gloss of Jerome observes:5 “It is better not to be than to be evilly.” In this sense the damned can prefer not to be, according to their deliberate reason.
4 *Ethics*, v, 1 (1129a8).
5 *Glossa ordin.* (iv, 139E); Jerome, *In Jeremiam* (PL 24, 838).

Reply Objection 1. The saying of Augustine is to be understood in the sense that not to be is a matter of choice not in itself but accidentally, as putting an end to unhappiness. For when it is stated that to be and to live are desired by all naturally, we are not to take this as referable to an evil and corrupt life, and a life of unhappiness, as the Philosopher says,6 but absolutely.
6 *Ethics*, ix, 9 (1170a22).

Reply Objection 2. Non-being is subject to choice, not in itself, but only accidentally, as stated already (Reply Objection 1).

Reply Objection 3. Although not to be is very evil, in so far as it removes being, it is very good, in so far as it removes unhappiness, which is the greatest of evils, and thus it is preferred not to be.

## Article 4. Whether in Hell the Damned Would Wish Others Were Damned Who Are Not Damned?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that in hell the damned would not wish others were damned who are not damned.

Objection 1. For it is said (Luke 16:27-28) of the rich man that he prayed for his brethren, lest they should come into the place of torments. Therefore in like manner the other damned would not wish, at least, their friends in the flesh to be damned in hell.

Objection 2. Further, The damned are not deprived of their inordinate affections. Now some of the damned loved inordinately some who are not damned. Therefore they would not desire their evil, that is, that they should be damned.

Objection 3. Further, the damned do not desire the increase of their punishment. Now if more were damned, their punishment would be greater, even as the joy of the blessed is increased by an increase in their number. Therefore the damned desire not the damnation of those who are saved.

On the contrary, A gloss on Isa. 14:9,
> are risen up from their thrones,
says: “The wicked are comforted by having many companions in their punishment.”1
1 *Glossa ordin.* (iv, 32E); cf. Jerome, *In Isaiam* (PL 24, 165).

Further, Envy reigns supreme in the damned. Therefore they grieve for the happiness of the blessed, and desire their damnation.

I answer that, Even as in the blessed in heaven there will be most perfect charity, so in the damned there will be the most perfect hate. Therefore as the saints will rejoice in all goods, so will the damned grieve for all goods. Consequently the sight of the happiness of the saints will give them very great pain; hence it is written (Isa. 26:11):
> Let the envious people see and be confounded, and let fire devour Thy enemies.
Therefore they will wish all the good were damned.

Reply Objection 1. So great will be the envy of the damned that they will envy the glory even of their kindred, since they themselves are supremely unhappy, for this happens even in this life, when envy increases. Nevertheless they will envy their kindred less than others, and their punishment would be greater if all their kindred were damned, and others saved, than if some of their kindred were saved. For this reason the rich man prayed that his brethren might be warded from damnation, for he knew that some are guarded therefrom. Yet he would rather that his brethren were damned as well as all the rest.

Reply Objection 2. Love that is not based on virtue is easily cut off, especially in evil men, as the Philosopher says.2 Hence the damned will not preserve their friendship for those whom they loved inordinately. Yet the will of them will remain perverse, because they will continue to love the cause of their inordinate loving.
2 *Ethics*, viii, 8 (1159b7).

Reply Objection 3. Although an increase in the number of the damned results in an increase of each one’s punishment, so much the more will their hatred and envy increase that they will prefer to be more tormented with many rather than less tormented alone.

## Article 5. Whether the Damned Hate God?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that the damned do not hate God.

Objection 1. For, according to Dionysius (*De Divinis Nominibus* i),3 “the beautiful and good that is the cause of all goodness and beauty is beloved of all.” But this is God. Therefore God cannot be the object of anyone’s hate.
3 Sect. 10 (PG 3, 708).

Objection 2. Further, No one can hate goodness itself, as neither can one will badness itself, since “evil is altogether involuntary,” as Dionysius asserts (*De Divinis Nominibus* iv).4 Now God is goodness itself. Therefore no one can hate Him.
4 Sect. 32 (PG 3, 732).

On the contrary, It is written (Ps. 73:23):
> The pride of them that hate Thee ascendeth continually.

I answer that, The appetite is moved by good or evil apprehended. Now God is apprehended in two ways, namely in Himself, as by the blessed, who see Him in His essence; and in His effects, as by us and by the damned. Since, then, He is goodness by His essence, He cannot in Himself be displeasing to any will; therefore whoever sees Him in His essence cannot hate Him. On the other hand, some of His effects are displeasing to the will in so far as they are opposed to any one, and accordingly a person may hate God not in Himself, but by reason of His effects. Therefore the damned, perceiving God in His punishment, which is the effect of His justice, hate Him, even as they hate the punishment inflicted on them.

Reply Objection 1. The saying of Dionysius refers to the natural appetite; and even this is rendered perverse in the damned, by that which is added to it by their deliberate will, as stated above (Article 1, Reply Objection 1).

Reply Objection 2. This argument would prove if the damned saw God in Himself, as being in His essence.

## Article 6. Whether the Damned Demerit?

We proceed thus to the Sixth Article: It would seem that the damned demerit.

Objection 1. For the damned have an evil will, as stated in the last Distinction of *Sentences* IV.5 But they demerited by the evil will that they had here. Therefore if they do not demerit there, their damnation is to their advantage.
5 Dist. 50, chap. 1 (*QR* II, 1032).

Objection 2. Further, The damned are on the same footing as the demons. Now the demons demerit after their fall, and thus God inflicted a punishment on the serpent, who induced man to sin (Gen. 3:14-15). Therefore the damned also demerit.

Objection 3. Further, An inordinate act that proceeds from a deliberate will is not excused from demerit, even though there be necessity of which one is oneself the cause, for the drunken man deserves a double punishment if he commit a crime through being drunk.1 Now the damned were themselves the cause of their own obstinacy, owing to which they are under a kind of necessity of sinning. Therefore since their act proceeds from their free choice, they are not excused from demerit.
1 *Ethics*, iii, 5 (1113b31).

On the contrary, Punishment is divided against fault. Now the perverse will of the damned proceeds from their obstinacy, which is their punishment. Therefore the perverse will of the damned is not a fault by which they may demerit.

Further, After reaching the last term there is no further movement, or advancement in good or evil. Now the damned, especially after the judgment day, will have reached the last term of their damnation, since “then there will cease to be two cities,” according to Augustine (*Enchiridion*, c.xi).2 Therefore after the judgment day the damned will not demerit by their perverse will, for if they did their damnation would be augmented.
2 PL 40, 284.

I answer that, We must draw a distinction between the damned before the judgment day and after. For all are agreed that after the judgment day there will be neither merit nor demerit. The reason for this is because merit or demerit is directed to the attainment of some further good or evil, and after the day of judgment good and evil will have reached their ultimate consummation, so that there will be no further addition to good or evil. Consequently, good will in the blessed will not be a merit but a reward, and evil will in the damned will be not a demerit but a punishment only. For works of virtue belong especially to the state of happiness, and their contraries to the state of unhappiness.3
3 Aristotle, *Ethics*, i, 10 (1100b9).

On the other hand, some say that, before the judgment day, both the good merit and the damned demerit. But this cannot apply to the essential reward or to the principal punishment, since in this respect both have reached the term. Possibly, however, this may apply to the accidental reward, or secondary punishment, which are subject to increase until the day of judgment. Especially may this apply to the demons, or to the good angels, by whose activities some are drawn to salvation, whereby the joy of the blessed angels is increased, and some to damnation, whereby the punishment of the demons is augmented.4
4 Cf. *Summa Theologica*, Part I, Q. 62, Art. 9, Reply 3; Part II-II, Q. 13, Art. 4, Reply 2.

Reply Objection 1. It is in the highest degree unprofitable to have reached the highest degree of evil, the result being that the damned are incapable of demerit. Hence it is clear that they gain no advantage from their sin.

Reply Objection 2. Men who are damned are not occupied in drawing others to damnation, as the demons are, for which reason the latter demerit as regards their secondary punishment.

Reply Objection 3. The reason why they are not excused from demerit is not because they are under the necessity of sinning, but because they have reached the highest of evils.

However, the necessity of sinning of which we are ourselves the cause, in so far as it is a necessity, excuses from sin, because every sin needs to be voluntary; but it does not excuse, in so far as it proceeds from a previous act of the will, and consequently the whole demerit of the subsequent sin would seem to belong to the previous sin.

## Article 7. Whether the Damned Can Make Use of the Knowledge They Had in This World?

We proceed thus to the Seventh Article: It would seem that the damned are unable to make use of the knowledge they had in this world.

Objection 1. For there is very great pleasure in the consideration of knowledge. But we must not admit that they have any pleasure. Therefore they cannot make use of the knowledge they had previously, by applying their consideration to it.

Objection 2. Further, The damned suffer greater pains than any pains of this world. Now in this world, when one is in very great pain, it is impossible to consider any intelligible conclusions, through being distracted by the pains that one suffers. Much less therefore can one do so in hell.

Objection 3. Further, The damned are subject to time. But “length of time is the cause of forgetfulness.”5 Therefore the damned will forget what they knew here.
5 Aristotle, *Physics*, iv, 13 (222b19).

On the contrary, It is said to the rich man who was damned (Luke 16:25):
> Remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, etc.
Therefore they will consider about the things they knew here.

Further, The intelligible species remain in the separated soul, as stated above (*Summa Theologica*, Part I, Q. 70, Art. 2, Reply 3; Part I, Q. 89, Art. 6). Therefore, if they could not use them these would remain in them to no purpose.

I answer that, Even as in the saints, on account of the perfection of their glory, there will be nothing but what is a matter of joy, so there will be nothing in the damned but what is a matter and cause of sorrow; nor will anything that can pertain to sorrow be lacking, so that their unhappiness is consummate. Now the consideration of certain things known brings us joy, in some respect, either on the part of the things known, because we love them, or on the part of the knowledge, because it is fitting and perfect. There may also be a reason for sorrow both on the part of the things known, because they are of a grievous nature, and on the part of the knowledge, if we consider its imperfection; for instance a person may consider his defective knowledge about a certain thing, which he would desire to know perfectly. Accordingly, in the damned there will be actual consideration of the things they knew previously as matters of sorrow, but not as a cause of pleasure. For they will consider both the evil they have done, and for which they were damned, and the delightful goods they have lost, and on both counts they will suffer torments. Likewise they will be tormented with the thought that the knowledge they had of speculative matters was imperfect, and that they missed its highest degree of perfection which they might have acquired.

Reply Objection 1. Although the consideration of knowledge is delightful in itself, it may accidentally be the cause of sorrow, as explained above.

Reply Objection 2. In this world the soul is united to a corruptible body, and therefore the soul’s consideration is hindered by the suffering of the body. On the other hand, in the future life the soul will not be so drawn by the body, but however much the body may suffer, the soul will have a most clear view of those things that can be a cause of anguish to it.

Reply Objection 3. Time causes forgetfulness accidentally, in so far as the movement of which it is the measure is the cause of change. But after the judgment day there will be no movement of the heavens; therefore neither will it be possible for forgetfulness to result from any lapse of time however long. Before the judgment day, however, the separated soul is not changed from its disposition by the heavenly movement.

## Article 8. Whether the Damned Will Ever Think of God?

We proceed thus to the Eighth Article: It would seem that the damned will sometimes think of God.

Objection 1. For one cannot hate a thing actually unless one think about it. Now the damned will hate God, as stated in the text of the fourth book of the *Sentences* in the last Distinction.5 Therefore they will think of God sometimes.
5 Dist. 50, chap. 2 (*QR* II, 1034).

Objection 2. Further, The damned will have remorse of conscience. But the conscience suffers remorse for deeds done against God. Therefore they will sometimes think of God.

On the contrary, Man’s most perfect thoughts are those which are about God, whereas the damned will be in a state of the greatest imperfection. Therefore they will not think of God.

I answer that, One may think of God in two ways. First, in Himself and according to that which is proper to Him, namely that He is the fount of all goodness, and thus it is altogether impossible to think of Him without delight, so that the damned will by no means think of Him in this way. Secondly, according to something accidental as it were to Him in His effects, such as His punishments, and so forth, and in this respect the thought of God can bring sorrow, so that in this way the damned will think of God.

Reply Objection 1. The damned do not hate God except because He punishes and forbids what is agreeable to their evil will, and consequently they will think of Him only as punishing and forbidding. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection, since conscience will not have remorse for sin except as forbidden by the Divine commandment.

## Article 9. Whether the Damned See the Glory of the Blessed?

We proceed thus to the Ninth Article: It would seem that the damned do not see the glory of the blessed.

Objection 1. For they are more distant from the glory of the blessed than from the happenings of this world. But they do not see what happens in regard to us; hence Gregory commenting on Job 14:21,
> Whether his children come to honour etc.
says (*Moralia*, xii, 21):2 “Even as those who still live know not in what place are the souls of the dead, so the dead who have lived in the body know not the things which regard the life of those who are in the flesh.” Much less, therefore, can they see the glory of the blessed.
2 PL 75, 999.

Objection 2. Further, That which is granted as a great favour to the saints in this life is never granted to the damned. Now it was granted as a great favour to Paul to see the life in which the saints live for ever with God, as the gloss on 2 Cor. 12:2 states.1 Therefore the damned will not see the glory of the saints.
1 *Glossa interlinearis* (vi, 76r); *Glossa Lombardi* (PL 192, 79).

On the contrary, It is stated (Luke 16:23):
> that the rich man in the midst of his torments saw Abraham . . . and Lazarus in his bosom.

I answer that, The damned, before the judgment day, will see the blessed in glory, in such a way as to know, not what that glory is like, but only that they are in a state of glory that surpasses all thought. This will trouble them, both because they will, through envy, grieve for their happiness, and because they have forfeited that glory. Hence it is written (Wisd. 5:2) concerning the wicked:
> Seeing it they shall be troubled with terrible fear.
After the judgment day, however, they will be altogether deprived of seeing the blessed; nor will this lessen their punishment, but will increase it, because they will bear in remembrance the glory of the blessed which they saw at or before the judgment, and this will torment them. Moreover they will be tormented by finding themselves considered unworthy even to see the glory which the saints merit to have.

Reply Objection 1. The happenings of this life would not, if seen, torment the damned in hell as the sight of the glory of the saints. Therefore the things which happen here are not shown to the damned in the same way as the saints’ glory; although also of the things that happen here, those are shown to them which are capable of causing them sorrow.

Reply Objection 2. Paul looked upon that life wherein the saints live with God, by actual experience of it and by hoping to have it more perfectly in the life to come. Not so the damned, and therefore the comparison fails.

## QUESTION XCIX
### Of God's Mercy and Justice Towards the Damned
(In Five Articles)

We must next consider God's justice and mercy towards the damned, under which head there are five points of inquiry:
1.  Whether by Divine justice an eternal punishment is inflicted on sinners?
2.  Whether by God’s mercy all punishment both of men and of demons comes to an end?
3.  Whether at least the punishment of men comes to an end?
4.  Whether at least the punishment of Christians has an end?
5.  Whether there is an end to the punishment of those who have performed works of mercy?

## Article 1. Whether By Divine Justice an Eternal Punishment Is Inflicted on Sinners?

We proceed thus to the First Article: It would seem that an eternal punishment is not inflicted on sinners by Divine justice.

Objection 1. For the punishment should not exceed the fault:
> According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be (Deut. 25:2).
Now fault is temporal. Therefore the punishment should not be eternal.

Objection 2. Further, Of two mortal sins one is greater than the other, and therefore one should receive a greater punishment than the other. But no punishment is greater than eternal punishment, since it is infinite. Therefore eternal punishment is not due to every sin; and if it is not due to one, it is due to none, since they are not infinitely distant from one another.

Objection 3. Further, A just judge does not punish except in order to correct, and therefore it is stated2 that “punishments are a kind of medicine.” Now, to punish the wicked eternally does not lead to their correction, nor to that of others, since then there will be no one in future who can be corrected thereby. Therefore eternal punishment is not inflicted for sins according to Divine justice.
2 Aristotle, *Ethics*, ii, 3 (1104b17).

Objection 4. Further, No one wishes that which is not desirable for its own sake, except on account of some advantage. Now God does not wish punishment for its own sake, for He delights not in punishment.3 Since then no advantage can result from the perpetuity of punishment, it would seem that He ought not to inflict such a punishment for sin.
3 Cf. Wisd. 1:13.

Objection 5. Further, Nothing accidental lasts for ever.4 But punishment is one of those things that happen accidentally, since it is contrary to nature. Therefore it cannot be everlasting.
4 Aristotle, *Heavens*, i, 2 (269b6); cf. ii, 3 (286a17).

Objection 6. Further, The justice of God would seem to require that sinners should be brought to nothing, because on account of ingratitude a person deserves to lose all benefits; and among other benefits of God there is being itself. Therefore it would seem just that the

sinner who has been ungrateful to God should lose his being. But if sinners be brought to nothing, their punishment cannot be everlasting. Therefore it would seem out of keeping with Divine justice that sinners should be punished for ever.

On the contrary, It is written (Matt. 25. 46): These, namely the wicked, shall go into everlasting punishment.

Further, As reward is to merit, so is punishment to guilt. Now, according to Divine justice, an eternal reward is due to temporal merit: Every one who seeth the Son and believeth in Him hath (Vulg.,—that everyone . . . may have) life everlasting. Therefore according to Divine justice an everlasting punishment is due to temporal guilt.

Further, According to the Philosopher,^1 punishment is meted according to the dignity of the person sinned against, so that a person who strikes one in authority receives a greater punishment than one who strikes anyone else. Now whoever sins mortally sins against God, Whose commandments he breaks, and Whose honour he gives another, by placing his end in someone other than God. But God’s majesty is infinite. Therefore whoever sins mortally deserves infinite punishment; and consequently it seems just that for a mortal sin a man should be punished for ever.

I answer that, Since punishment is measured in two ways, namely according to the degree of its severity, and according to its length of time, the measure of punishment corresponds to the measure of fault, as regards the degree of severity, so that the more grievously a person sins the more grievously is he punished: As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her (Apoc. 18. 7). The duration of the punishment does not, however, correspond with the duration of the fault, as Augustine says,^2 for adultery which is committed in a short space of time is not punished with a momentary penalty even according to human laws. But the duration of punishment regards the disposition of the sinner, for sometimes a person who commits an offence in a city is rendered by his very offence worthy of being cut off entirely from the fellowship of the citizens, either by perpetual exile or even by death; sometimes however he is not rendered worthy of being cut off entirely from the fellowship of the citizens, and therefore in order that he may become a fitting member of the State, his punishment is prolonged or curtailed, according as is expedient for his amendment, so that he may live in the city in a becoming and peaceful manner.

So too, according to Divine justice, sin renders a person worthy to be altogether cut off from the fellowship of God’s city, and this is the effect of every sin committed against charity, which is the bond uniting this same city together. Consequently, for mortal sin which is contrary to charity a person is expelled for ever from the fellowship of the saints and condemned to everlasting punishment, because as Augustine says,^3 “as men are cut off from this perishable city by the penalty of the first death, so are they excluded from that imperishable city by the punishment of the second death.” That the punishment inflicted by the earthly state is not regarded as everlasting is accidental, either because man does not endure for ever, or because the state itself comes to an end. Therefore if man lived for ever, the punishment of exile or slavery, which is pronounced by human law, would remain in him for ever. On the other hand, as regards those who sin in such a way as not to deserve to be entirely cut off from the fellowship of the saints, such as those who sin venially, their punishment will be so much the shorter or longer according as they are more or less fit to be cleansed, through sin clinging to them more or less; this is observed in the punishments of this world and of purgatory according to Divine justice.

We find also other reasons given by the saints why some are justly condemned to everlasting punishment for a temporal sin. One is because they sinned against an eternal good by despising eternal life. This is mentioned by Augustine:^4 “He is become worthy of eternal evil, who destroyed in himself a good which could be eternal.” Another reason is because man sinned in his own eternity; therefore Gregory says (*Dial.*, iv, 44),^5 “it belongs to the great justice of the judge that those should never cease to be punished who in this life never ceased to desire sin.” And if it be objected that some who sin mortally propose to amend their life at some time, and that these accordingly would not be deserving of eternal punishment, it must be replied according to some that Gregory speaks of the will that is made manifest by the deed. For he who falls into mortal sin of his own will puts himself in a state from which he cannot be rescued unless God help him; therefore from the very fact that he is willing to sin, he is willing to remain in sin for ever. For man is a wind that goeth, namely to sin, and returneth not by his own power (Ps. 77. 39).^6 Thus if a man were to throw himself into a pit from which he could not get out without help, one might say that he wished to remain there for ever, whatever else he may have thought himself. Another and a better answer is that from the very fact that he commits a mortal sin, he places his end in a creature; and since the whole of life is directed to its end, it follows that for this very reason he directs the whole of his life to that sin, and is willing to remain in sin for ever if he could do so with impunity. This is what Gregory says on Job 41. 23, He shall esteem the deep as growing old (*Moral.*, xxxiv, 19):^7 ‘‘The wicked only put an end to sinning because their life came to an end; they would indeed have wished to live for ever, that they might continue in sin for ever, for they desire rather to sin than to live.”

Still another reason may be given why the punishment of mortal sin is eternal, because thereby one offends God Who is infinite. Therefore since punishment cannot be infinite in intensity, because the creature is incapable of an infinite quality, it must be infinite at least in duration. And again there is a fourth reason for the same, because guilt remains for ever, since it cannot be remitted without grace, and men cannot receive grace after death; nor should punishment cease so long as guilt remains.

Reply Obj. 1. Punishment does not have to be equal to fault as to the amount of duration, as is seen to be the case also with human laws. We may also reply with Gregory^8 that although sin is temporal in act, it is eternal in will.

Reply Obj. 2. The degree of intensity in the punishment corresponds to the degree of gravity in the sin; therefore mortal sins unequal in gravity will receive a punishment unequal in intensity but equal in duration.

Reply Obj. 3. The punishments inflicted on those who are not altogether expelled from the society of their fellow-citizens are intended for their correction, whereas those punishments whereby certain persons are wholly banished from the society of their fellow-citizens are not intended for their correction, although they may be intended for the correction and tranquillity of the others who remain in the state. Accordingly the damnation of the wicked is for the correction of those who are now in the Church; for punishments are intended for correction not only when they are being inflicted, but also when they are decreed.

Reply Obj. 4. The everlasting punishment of the wicked will not be altogether useless. For they are useful for two purposes. First, because thereby the Divine justice is safeguarded which is acceptable to God for its own sake. Hence Gregory says (*Dial.*, iv, 44):^9 “Almighty God on account of His loving kindness delights not in the torments of the unhappy, but on account of His justice. He is for ever unappeased by the punishment of the wicked.”

Secondly, they are useful, because the elect rejoice therein, when they see God’s justice in them, and realize that they have escaped them. Hence it is written (Ps. 57. 12): The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge,^10 etc., and (Isa. 66. 24): They, namely the wicked, shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh, namely to the saints, as a gloss says.^11 Gregory expresses himself in the same sense:^12 “The wicked are all condemned to eternal punishment, and are punished for their own wickedness. Yet they will burn to some purpose, namely that the just may all both see in God the joys they receive, and perceive in them the torments they have escaped, for which reason they will acknowledge themselves for ever the debtors of Divine grace, the more that they will see how the evils which they overcame by its assistance are punished eternally.”

Reply Obj. 5. Although the punishment relates to the soul accidentally, it relates essentially to the soul infected with guilt. And since guilt will remain in the soul for ever, its punishment also will be everlasting.

Reply Obj. 6. Punishment corresponds to fault, properly speaking, in respect of the lack of order in the fault, and not of the dignity in the person offended; for if the latter were the case, a punishment of infinite intensity would correspond to every sin. Accordingly, although a man deserves to lose his being from the fact that he has sinned against God, the author of his being, yet, in view of the lack of order of the act itself, loss of being is not due to him, since being is presupposed to merit and demerit, nor is being lost or corrupted by the lack of order of sin; and consequently privation of being cannot be the punishment due to any sin.

## Article 2. Whether By God’s Mercy All Punishment of the Damned, Both Men and Demons, Comes to an End?

We proceed thus to the Second Article: It would seem that by God’s mercy all punishment of the damned, both men and demons, comes to an end.

Objection 1. For it is written (Wisd. 11. 24): Thou hast mercy upon all, O Lord, because Thou canst do all things. But among all things the demons also are included, since they are God’s creatures. Therefore also their punishment will come to an end.

Obj. 2. Further, God hath concluded all in sin (Vulg.,—unbelief), that He may have mercy on all (Rom. 11. 32). Now God has concluded the demons under sin, that is to say, He permitted them to be concluded. Therefore it would seem that in time He has mercy even on the demons.

Obj. 3. Further, As Anselm says (*Cur Deus Homo*, ii, 4),^1 “it is not just that God should permit the utter loss of a creature which He made for happiness.” Therefore, since every rational creature was created for happiness, it would seem unjust for it to be allowed to perish altogether.

On the contrary, It is written (Matt. 25. 41): Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Therefore they will be punished eternally.

Further, Just as the good angels were made happy through turning to God, so the bad angels were made unhappy through turning away from God. Therefore if the unhappiness of the wicked angels comes at length to an end, the happiness of the good will also come to an end, which cannot be admitted.

I answer that, As Augustine says,^2 “Origen erred in maintaining that the demons will at length, through God’s mercy, be delivered from their punishment.” But this error has been condemned by the Church for two reasons. First because it is clearly contrary to the authority of Holy Writ (Apoc. 20. 9, 10): The devil who seduced them was cast into the pool of fire and brimstone, where both the beasts and the false prophets (Vulg.,—the beast and false prophet, etc.) shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever, which is the Scriptural expression for eternity. Secondly, because this opinion exaggerated God’s mercy in one direction and depreciated it in another. For it would seem equally reasonable for the good angels to remain in eternal happiness and for the wicked angels to be eternally punished. Therefore just as he maintained that the demons and the souls of the damned are to be delivered at length from their sufferings, so he maintained that the angels and the souls of the blessed will at length pass from their happy state to the unhappiness of this life.

Reply Obj. 1. God, for His own part, has mercy on all. Since, however, His mercy is ruled by the order of His wisdom, the result is that it does not reach to certain people who render themselves unworthy of that mercy, as do the demons and the damned who are obstinate in wickedness. And yet we may say that even in them His mercy finds a place, in so far as they are punished less than they wholly deserve but not that they are entirely delivered from punishment.

Reply Obj. 2. In the words quoted the distribution (of the predicate) regards the genera and not the individuals, so that the statement applies to men in the state of wayfarer, because, that is, He had mercy both on Jews and on Gentiles, but not on every Gentile or every Jew.

Reply Obj. 3. Anselm means that it is not just with regard to appropriateness to God’s goodness, and is speaking of the creature generically. For it does not become the Divine goodness that a whole genus of creature fail of the end for which it was made; therefore it is unbecoming for all men or all angels to be damned. But there is no reason why some men or some angels should perish for ever, because the intention of the Divine will is fulfilled in the others who are saved.

## Article 3. Whether God’s Mercy Suffers At Least Men To Be Punished Eternally?

We proceed thus to the Third Article: It would seem that God’s mercy does not suffer at least men to be punished eternally.

Objection 1. For it is written (Gen. 6. 3): My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, where “spirit” denotes indignation, as a gloss observes.^1 Therefore, since God’s indignation is not distinct from His punishment, man will not be punished eternally.

Obj. 2. Further, The charity of the saints in this life makes them pray for their enemies. Now they will have more perfect charity in that life. Therefore they will pray then for their enemies who are damned. But the prayers of the saints cannot be in vain, since they are most acceptable to God. Therefore at the saints’ prayers the Divine mercy will in time deliver the damned from their punishment.

Obj. 3. Further, God’s foretelling of the punishment of the damned belongs to the prophecy of threats. Now the prophecy of threats is not always fulfilled, as appears from what was said of the destruction of Nineve (Jonas 3.); and yet it was not destroyed as foretold by the prophet, who also was troubled for that very reason (4. 1). Therefore it would seem that much more will the threat of eternal punishment be commuted by God’s mercy for a more lenient punishment, when this will be able to give sorrow to none but joy to all.

Obj. 4. Further, The words of Ps. 76. 8 are to the point, where it is said: Will God then be angry for ever? (Vulg.,—Will God then cast off for ever?) But God’s anger is His punishment. Therefore, etc.

Obj. 5. Further, A gloss on Isa. 14. 19, But thou art cast out, etc., says:^2 “Even though all souls shall have rest at last, thou never shalt,” and it refers to the devil. Therefore it would seem that all human souls shall at length have rest from their pains.

On the contrary, It is written (Matt. 25. 46) of the elect together with the damned: These shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. But it is inadmissible that the life of the just will ever have an end. Therefore it is inadmissible that the punishment of the damned will ever come to an end.

Further, As Damascene says (*De Fide Orthod.* ii, 4)^3 “death is to men what their fall was to the angels.” Now after their fall the angels could not be restored. Therefore neither can man after death. And thus the punishment of the damned will have no end.

I answer that, As Augustine says,^4 some evaded the error of Origen by asserting that the demons are punished everlastingly, while holding that all men, even unbelievers, are at length set free from punishment. But this statement is altogether unreasonable. For just as the demons are obstinate in wickedness and therefore have to be punished for ever, so too are the souls of men who die without charity, since “death is to men what their fall was to the angels,” as Damascene says (*loc. cit.*).

Reply Obj. 1. This saying refers to man generically, because God’s indignation was at length removed from the human race by the coming of Christ. But those who were unwilling to be included or to remain in this reconciliation effected by Christ, perpetuated the Divine anger in themselves, since no other way of reconciliation is given to us save that which is through Christ.

Reply Obj. 2. As Augustine^5 and Gregory (*Moral.*, xxxiv, 19)^6 say, the saints in this life pray for their enemies that they may be converted to God, while it is yet possible for them to be converted. For if we knew that they were foreknown to death, we should no more pray for them than for the demons. And since for those who depart this life without grace there will be no further time for conversion, no prayer will be offered for them, neither by the Church militant, nor by the Church triumphant. For that which we have to pray for them is, as the Apostle says (II Tim. 2. 25, 26), that God may give them repentance to know the truth, and they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil.

Reply Obj. 3. A punishment threatened prophetically is only then commuted when there is a change in the merits of the person threatened. Hence: I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation . . . shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them (Jer. 18. 7). Therefore, since the merits of the damned cannot be changed, the threatened punishment will always be fulfilled in them. Nevertheless the prophecy of threats is always fulfilled in a certain sense, because as Augustine says:^7 “Nineve has been overthrown, that was evil, and a good Nineve is built up, that was not; for while the walls and the houses remained standing, the city was overthrown in its wicked ways.”

Reply Obj. 4. These words of the Psalm refer to the vessels of mercy, which have not made themselves unworthy of mercy, because in this life (which may be called God’s anger on account of its unhappiness) He changes vessels of mercy into something better. Hence the Psalm continues (verse 11): This is the change of the right hand of the most High. We may also reply that they refer to mercy as granting a relaxation but not setting free altogether if it be referred also to the damned. Hence the Psalm does not say: Will He from His anger shut up His mercies? but in His anger, because the punishment will not be done away entirely; but His mercy will have effect by diminishing the punishment while it continues.

Reply Obj. 5. This gloss is speaking not absolutely but on an impossible supposition in order to throw into relief the greatness of the devil’s sin, or of Nabuchodonosor’s.

## Article 4. Whether the Punishment of Christians Is Brought To an End By the Mercy of God?

We proceed thus to the Fourth Article: It would seem that at least the punishment of Christians is brought to an end by the mercy of God.

Objection 1. For he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved (Mark 16. 16). Now this applies to every Christian. Therefore all Christians will at length be saved.

Obj. 2. Further, It is written (John 6. 55): He that eateth My body and drinketh My blood hath eternal life. Now this is the meat and drink of which Christians partake in common. Therefore all Christians will be saved at length.

Obj. 3. Further, If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire (I Cor. 3. 15), where it is a question of those who have the foundation of the Christian faith. Therefore all such persons will be saved in the end.

On the contrary, It is written (I Cor. 6.9): The unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God. Now some Christians are unjust. Therefore Christians will not all come to the kingdom of God, and consequently they will be punished for ever.

Further, It is written (II Pet. 2. 21): It had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, than after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them. Now those who know not the way of truth will be punished for ever. Therefore Christians who have turned back after knowing it will also be punished for ever.

I answer that, According to Augustine^1 there have been some who predicted a delivery from eternal punishment not for all men, but only for Christians; although they stated the matter in different ways. For some said that whoever received the sacraments of faith would be immune from eternal punishment. But this is contrary to the truth, since some receive the sacraments of faith, and yet have not faith, without which it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11. 6). Therefore others said that those alone will be exempt from eternal punishment who have received the sacraments of faith, and professed the Catholic faith. But against this it would seem that at one time some people profess the Catholic faith, and afterwards abandon it, and these are deserving not of a lesser but of a greater punishment, since according to II Pet. 2. 21, it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back. Moreover it is clear that heresiarchs who renounce the Catholic faith and invent new heresies sin more grievously than those who have conformed to some heresy from the first. And therefore some have maintained that those alone are exempt from eternal punishment who persevere to the end in the Catholic faith, however guilty they may have been of other crimes. But this is clearly contrary to Holy Writ, for it is written (James 2. 20): Faith without works is dead, and (Matt. 7. 21) Not every one that saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of My Father Who is in heaven; and in many other passages Holy Scripture threatens sinners with eternal punishment. Consequently those who persevere in the faith unto the end will not all be exempt from eternal punishment, unless in the end they prove to be free from other crimes.

Reply Obj. 1. Our Lord speaks there of formed faith that worketh by love (Vulg.,—charity, Gal. 5. 6) in which whosoever dies shall be saved. But to this faith not only is the error of unbelief opposed, but also any mortal sin whatsoever.

Reply Obj. 2. The saying of our Lord refers not to those who partake only sacramentally, and who sometimes by receiving unworthily eat and drink judgment to themselves (I Cor. 11. 29), but to those who eat spiritually and are incorporated with Him by charity, which incorporation is the effect of the sacramental eating, in those who approach worthily. Therefore, so far as the power of the sacrament is concerned, it brings us to eternal life, although sin may deprive us of that fruit, even after we have received worthily.

Reply Obj. 3. In this passage of the Apostle the foundation denotes formed faith, upon which whosoever shall build venial sins shall suffer loss, because he will be punished for them by God; yet he himself shall be saved in the end by fire, either of temporal tribulation, or of the punishment of purgatory which will be after death.

## Article 5. Whether All Those Who Perform Works of Mercy Will Be Punished Eternally?

We proceed thus to the Fifth Article: It would seem that all who perform works of mercy will not be punished eternally, but only those who neglect those works.

Objection 1. For it is written (James 2. 13): Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy; and (Matt. 5. 7): Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.

Obj. 2. Further, (Matt. 25. 35-46) we find a description of our Lord’s discussion with the damned and the elect. But this discussion is only about works of mercy. Therefore eternal punishment will be awarded only to such as have omitted to practise works of mercy; and consequently the same conclusion follows as before.

Obj. 3. Further, It is written (Matt. 6. 12): Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors, and further on (verse 14): For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences. Therefore it would seem that the merciful, who forgive others their offences, will themselves obtain the forgiveness of their sins, and consequently will not be punished eternally.

Obj. 4. Further, A gloss of Ambrose on I Tim. 4. 8, Godliness is profitable to all things, says:^1 “The sum total of a Christian’s rule of life consists in mercy and godliness. Let a man follow this, and though he should suffer from the inconstancy of the flesh, without doubt he will be scourged, but he will not perish, whereas he who can boast of no other exercise but that of the body will suffer everlasting punishment.” Therefore those who persevere in works of mercy, though they be shackled with fleshly sins, will not be punished eternally; and thus the same conclusion follows as before.

On the contrary, It is written (I Cor. 6. 9, 10): Neither fornicators, . . . nor adulterers, etc., shall possess the kingdom of God. Yet many are such who practise works of mercy. Therefore the merciful will not all come to the eternal kingdom, and consequently some of them will be punished eternally.

Further, It is written (James 2. 10): Whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. Therefore

Whoever keeps the law as regards the works of mercy and omits other works is guilty of transgressing the law, and consequently will be punished eternally.

I answer that: As Augustine says in the book quoted above,[2] some have maintained that not all who have professed the Catholic faith will be freed from eternal punishment, but only those who persevere in works of mercy, although they be guilty of other crimes. But this cannot stand, because without charity nothing can be acceptable to God, nor does anything profit unto eternal life in the absence of charity. Now it happens that certain persons persevere in works of mercy without having charity. Therefore nothing profits them to the meriting of eternal life, or to exemption from eternal punishment, as may be gathered from 1 Cor. 13:3. Most evident is this in the case of those who lay hands on other people’s property, for after seizing on many things, they nevertheless spend something in works of mercy. We must therefore conclude that if any die in mortal sin, neither faith nor works of mercy will free them from eternal punishment, not even after any length of time whatever.

Reply to Objection 1. Those will obtain mercy who show mercy in an ordered manner. But those who, while merciful to others, are neglectful of themselves do not show mercy in an ordered manner; rather do they strike at themselves by their evil actions. Therefore such persons will not obtain the mercy that sets free altogether, even if they obtain that mercy which rebates somewhat their due punishment.

Reply to Objection 2. The reason why the discussion refers only to the works of mercy is not because eternal punishment will be inflicted on none but those who omit those works, but because eternal punishment will be remitted to those who, after sinning, have obtained forgiveness by their works of mercy, making unto themselves friends of the mammon of iniquity (Luke 16:9).

Reply to Objection 3. Our Lord said this to those who ask that their debt be forgiven, but not to those who persist in sin. Therefore the repentant alone will obtain by their works of mercy the forgiveness that sets them free altogether.

Reply to Objection 4. The gloss of Ambrose speaks of the inconstancy that consists in venial sin, from which a man will be freed through the works of mercy after the punishment of purgatory, which he calls a scourging. Or, if he speaks of the inconstancy of mortal sin, the sense is that those who, while yet in this life, fall into sins of the flesh through frailty are disposed to repentance by works of mercy. Therefore such a one will not perish; that is, he will be disposed by those works not to perish, through grace bestowed on him by our Lord, Who is blessed for evermore. Amen.
