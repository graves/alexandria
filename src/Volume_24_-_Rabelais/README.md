# Volume 24 - Rabelais

## FRANCOIS RABELAIS (c. 1494-1553)

Francois Rabelais was a French Renaissance writer, physician, and humanist. His satirical masterwork combines bawdy humor, wordplay, and profound humanist philosophy in a carnivalesque celebration of life.

### Works in This Volume

- **Gargantua and Pantagruel** - A sprawling comic epic following the adventures of two giants, Gargantua and his son Pantagruel.

  - The founding of the Abbey of Theleme ("Do what you will")
  - The adventures of Pantagruel and his companion Panurge
