# Volume 16 - Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler

Three pivotal works in the history of astronomy, spanning from the ancient geocentric model to the revolutionary heliocentric theory and the laws of planetary motion.

## PTOLEMY (c. 100-170 A.D.)

Claudius Ptolemy was a Greco-Egyptian astronomer, mathematician, and geographer whose astronomical system dominated Western and Islamic science for over a millennium.

- **The Almagest** - The definitive ancient treatise on astronomy, presenting a geocentric model of the universe with mathematical precision. Ptolemy's system of epicycles and deferents could predict planetary positions with remarkable accuracy.

## NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473-1543)

Polish astronomer and mathematician who initiated the Scientific Revolution by proposing a heliocentric model of the solar system.

- **On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres** - The foundational work of modern astronomy, arguing that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Published in 1543, it challenged the Ptolemaic system and transformed humanity's understanding of its place in the cosmos.

## JOHANNES KEPLER (1571-1630)

German astronomer and mathematician who discovered the laws of planetary motion, providing the mathematical foundation for the Copernican revolution.

- **Epitome of Copernican Astronomy** - A comprehensive textbook presenting the heliocentric system and Kepler's three laws of planetary motion

- **The Harmonies of the World** - Kepler's search for cosmic harmony, containing his third law relating orbital periods to distances from the Sun
