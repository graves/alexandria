# EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY

## BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
Johannes Kepler, 1571-1630

KEPLER was born December 27, 1571, at Weil, in the Duchy of Württemberg. He came from a noble but poverty-stricken family, and, as he later noted, was himself a premature and sickly son such as the planets had foretold. His father was a soldier of fortune and frequently away from home until he acquired a tavern in 1577. Kepler, in the periods when he was not working in the tavern, attended a German elementary school at Leonberg, but domestic bankruptcy after three years led to his being withdrawn and sent to labor in the fields.

Kepler's intellectual gifts were considered to indicate that he had a theological vocation, and in 1584 he was sent as a charity student to the Protestant seminary at Adelberg. Two years later he transferred to the college at Maulbronn. A brilliant examination for the bachelor's degree in 1588 enabled Kepler to go to the University of Tübingen, where he prepared for the master's degree in philosophy. As a part of the regular course of studies, he learned astronomy with Maestlin, who introduced him to the work of Copernicus. He wrote a paper on the reconciliation of the Copernican view with Sacred Scripture, but his principal desire was to enter the ministry. It was with considerable reluctance that he was finally persuaded in 1594 to accept the first post offered to him, the chair of astronomy at the Lutheran school of Graz.

While filling his office as astronomer at Graz, Kepler began to speculate on the order and distances of the planets. On July 19, 1595, he carefully noted down his “discovery" that “God in creating the universe and regulating the order of the cosmos had in view the five regular bodies of geometry as known since the days of Pythagoras and Plato." He embodied his theory on these relations in his first published work on astronomy, entitled the *Precursor of Cosmographic Dissertations* or the *Cosmographic Mystery*, which appeared late in 1596. The book brought its author much fame and a friendly correspondence with the two most eminent astronomers of the time, Tycho Brahe and Galileo.

In 1598 the Catholic archduke of Styria issued an edict of banishment against Protestant preachers and professors, and Kepler fled to the Hungarian border. Although reinstated in his post by the favor of the Jesuits, Kepler gladly accepted an offer from Tycho Brahe in 1600 to serve as his assistant at the observatory near Prague. A year later, upon the death of Tycho, Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician.

In his new post Kepler inherited the records of Tycho's observations. Utilizing these records and the results of his own observations at the Prague observatory, Kepler published a series of works which soon gained him a European reputation. To satisfy the astrological proclivities of the emperor, he first wrote a treatise *On the More Certain Foundations of Astrology* (1602). His prognostications were highly successful; commenting on this fact, he remarked that “Nature, which has conferred upon every animal the means of subsistence, has given astrology as an adjunct and ally to astronomy." A preliminary study of optics resulted in the publication of his *Optical Part of Astronomy* (1604), which, as completed by the *Dioptrics* (1611), contained important discoveries in the theory of vision. But Kepler's great work during these years was the elaboration of a new theory of the planets. Inspired by Gilbert’s book on the magnet and his own investigations of the orbit of Mars, which he had been studying since his first meeting with Tycho, Kepler published in 1609 his *New Aetiological Astronomy or Celestial Physics together with Commentaries on the Movements of the Planet Mars*, in which he enunciated the laws of elliptical orbits and of equal areas.

Meanwhile in his personal life Kepler was harassed upon every side. His salary was continually in arrears; his wife “fell a prey to despondent melancholy, . . . became seriously ill with Hungarian fever, epilepsy, and fits," and finally died; his three children succumbed to smallpox; and Prague itself became a battlefield. After “the terrible year of 1611,” Kepler, while still retaining the position of court astronomer, gratefully accepted the offer to become mathematician to Upper Austria. He moved to Linz, re-married in 1613, and resumed his astronomical investigations; but his personal fortunes showed little improvement.

The twelve years of Kepler’s residence at Linz saw the publication of many of his most important astronomical works. *The Harmonies of the World* appeared in 1619. Its dedication to James I of England was acknowledged with an invitation to that country, but Kepler, despite his distraught circumstances, refused to leave, as two years previously he had declined the chair of mathematics at Bologna. For some time he had been working upon the project of comprehending the whole scheme of the heavens in one great treatise to be called *Hipparchus*. The difficulties presented by the lunar theory finally compelled him to abandon his intention, and he recast a portion of his materials in the form of a dialogue intended for the general public, which was published as the *Epitome of Astronomy* (1618-21). In addition to these works and many essays dealing with chronology, Kepler devoted years to preparing for publication the astronomical tables compiled from his own observations and those of Tycho. In spite of financial difficulties and civil and religious conflict, they finally appeared in 1627 under the title of the *Rudolphine Tables*.

By this time Kepler’s claims upon the insolvent imperial treasury amounted to twelve thousand florins. In 1628, under an arrangement with the emperor, the debt was transferred to Duke Wallenstein of Friedland, and Kepler moved with his family to Sagan in Silesia. Wallenstein’s promises were only partially fulfilled, and in 1630 Kepler went to Ratisbon to present his case to the Diet. Shortly after his arrival he was taken ill with a fever and died on November 15. He was buried at Ratisbon. The epitaph, of his own composition, reads: “I had measured the heavens; now I measure earth’s shadows. Mind came from the heavens, Body’s shadow has fallen.”

## BOOK FOUR

Herein the natural and archetypal causes of Celestial Physics, that is, of all the magnitudes, movements, and proportions in the heavens, are explained and thus the Principles of the Doctrine on the Schemata are demonstrated.

This book is designed to serve as a supplement to Aristotle’s *On the Heavens*.

## TO THE READER

It has been ten years since I published my *Commentaries on the Movements of the Planet Mars*. As only a few copies of the book were printed, and as it had so to speak hidden the teaching about celestial causes in thickets of calculations and the rest of the astronomical apparatus, and since the more delicate readers were frightened away by the price of the book too, it seemed to my friends that I should be doing right and fulfilling my responsibilities, if I should write an epitome, wherein a summary of both the physical and astronomical teaching concerning the heavens would be set forth in plain and simple speech and with the boredom of the demonstrations alleviated. I did that before many years had passed. But meanwhile various delays came between the book and publication: the little book itself was not up to date in spots, and, unless I am mistaken, it was also incomplete in the form in which it was given, and even the plan of publication began to totter. For in the “doctrine concerning the sphere”—published before three years were up—I seemed to certain people to be more diffuse in arguing about the diurnal movement or repose of the earth than befitted the form of an epitome. Accordingly I reflected that if the readers had not digested that part, which was however absent from no epitome of astronomy, all the more strange to them would be this Fourth Book, which airs so many new and unthought-of things concerning the whole nature of the heavens—so that you might doubt whether you were doing a part of physics or astronomy, unless you recognized that speculative astronomy is one whole part of physics.

On the other hand, I considered that this was a matter for the sake of my amplifying which and impressing it upon the public—that is, for the sake of my writing this little book—many men of letters had become my friends: that these speculations could not be omitted, unless I spent my devotion in giving attention to the darkness of a doctrine of schemata which was robbed of its proper principles. At least, necessity—how I wish she were sometimes less importunate!—cut short this disputation: for necessity makes that which cannot be done otherwise seem to be undertaken as if by design. The press groaned and the work on the doctrine of schemata was being struck off, when its lawful godfather, whom I mentioned in the foreword to the *Spherical Doctrine*, attained his former state, and was sleeping, or perhaps giving up the ghost, and as the liberality of this most eminent patron was paying for the parts of this book, it became necessary for me suddenly to set out and to break off the work. At that same time the printers had reached the end of the Fourth Book and the Frankfurt market-day was at hand. I decided that it would be best if the Fourth Book, the subject-matter of which includes both physics and astronomy, were also published separately; whence, according to the choice of the astronomer buying, it could be passed over, or inserted into the rest of the epitome. Kind reader, you have the reasons for this publication, and I hope you will find them satisfactory.

But as regards this branch of philosophizing: it will not be out of keeping with the job at hand if I here set down in advance some things from the recent letter which I wrote to a man who is intimate with a great Prince and is himself also a great man. In this letter a comparison was undertaken between this book—or the related work *On the Harmonies*, published in the previous year—and Aristotle’s books *On the Heavens* and *Metaphysics*; and this philosophy (i.e., modern astronomy) was cleared of the worn-out charges of being esoteric and seeking after novelty.

> Accordingly, these are the excerpts from the aforesaid letter which have to do with the present undertaking:
>
> It seems to me I have nothing to worry about in the case of Aristotle: His Most Serene Highness is a Platonist in philosophy and a Christian in religion: His Most Serene Highness cannot dislike whatever is the more convincing, whether it be that the world was first made at a fixed beginning in time as was my work *On the Harmonies*, or will be destroyed at some time, or is merely liable to destruction, like the alterations of the ether and the celestial atmosphere; nor will he ever prefer the Master Aristotle to the truth of which Aristotle was ignorant.
>
> But if His Most Serene Highness has a high opinion of Aristotle, wheresoever he reveals the mysteries of philosophy, if he makes any serious remark or any praiseworthy attempt; for indeed he is the man who in *On the Heavens* (Book II, Chapter 5) asks: “For what reason are there many movements?” So I ask: “What are the reasons for the number of the planets?” He asks in the following chapter: “For what reason are the heavens borne from east to west rather than from west to east?” So I ask: “Why is any planet moved with so much speed, no more, no less?” In Chapter 9 he asks: “Do the stars give forth sounds which are modulated [*contemperatos*] harmonically?” and answers no: I split up his judgment, for I grant that no sounds are given forth but I affirm and demonstrate that the movements are modulated according to harmonic proportions. In Chapter 10 he asks “about the order of the spheres, the intervals, and the ratio of the movements to the orbital circles”; but he merely asks and fails in the attempt. Not only do I answer these questions with most luminous demonstrations by means of the five regular solids, but also I add the number of the planets, which has been deduced from the Archetype, so that it may be clear that the world is created. In Chapter 12 he asks: “Why in the descent from the upper to the lower planets are not the movements of the single planets found to be more manifold?” and he pronounces a judgment most elegantly tempered by the modesty of confession and the wisdom of assertion. “Let us try,” he says, “to say only that which appears as true; for we judge that the readiness” even to put forward what is probable “is worthy of being characterized as modesty rather than presumption, if anyone, in things concerning which there are very great difficulties, is content—in order to satisfy his thirst for philosophy—with even slight discussions such as these.” But I myself, led on by this same praiseworthy thirst for philosophy, first wiped away from the eyes of astronomy those mists of the multiplicity of movements in the single planets: then I gave a demonstration of the following: that the movement of the planet is not uniform throughout its whole circuit—as Aristotle argued in Chapters 6 and 7; but that in reality the movement is increased and decreased at places in its period which are fixed and are opposite to one another; and I explained the efficient or instrumental causes of this increase as the lessening of the interval between the planet and the sun, from which as from a source that movement arises. Then, as in each and every planet there is a very fast movement and a very slow movement and in a fixed proportion, I did not merely raise the question as to the reason for this proportion in the single planets separately and in all the planets in relation to one another; and why Saturn and Jupiter have middling eccentricities, Mars a great eccentricity, the Sun and Venus slight eccentricities, and Mercury a very great eccentricity; but I also brought forward a solution of this very great difficulty, and not a trifling discussion but one wholly legitimate; and I took my solution from the Archetype of the harmonic cosmos: whence it is established that this cosmos cannot be better than it is and that it is impossible that the world should not have been created at a fixed beginning in time.
>
> This attempt of mine ought not to have been checked by shyness, but should have been brought forth into the light with strength of mind, namely, with the highest confidence in the visible works of God—if one has leisure for knowledge of them—or at the exhortation of Aristotle himself, who judged that in these questions you should not suppress or be silent about probabilities any more than about fully explored certainties. Then he is that same Aristotle who, in the *Metaphysics*, Book XII, Chapter 8, in which place he built up the most sublime part of his philosophy, the part concerning the gods and the number of them; who, I say, sends his students to the astronomers and who defers to the astronomers in respect to their authority and the weight of their testimony; indeed he would never have scorned Tycho Brahe or even myself, if that fatal necessity of the generations had made us contemporaries. For he orders his students “To read through both,” that is to say, Eudoxus and Callippus, for the one had corrected the errors of the other; and today that would be to read both Ptolemy and Tycho: “But to follow” not, he says, the more ancient, but “the more accurate.” And so, if Aristotle is dear to that most just Prince, I call Aristotle to witness that he has suffered no injury, if the astronomer, using the arguments which modern times have put forward concerning the heavens, has indicated that creatures arose in the heavens and will disappear once more—in opposition to the opinion of him who alleges experience, but experience not sufficiently long.
>
> As regards the academies, they are established in order to regulate the studies of the pupils and are concerned not to have the program of teaching change very often: in such places, because it is a question of the progress of the students, it frequently happens that the things which have to be chosen are not those which are most true but those which are most easy. And by that division in things which makes different people form different judgments, it so happens that certain people are in error contrary to their own opinion. It seems to me that the truth concerning the mutable nature of the heavens can be taught conveniently; but someone else judges that students and teachers equally are thrown into confusion by this doctrine. But it is not without its use in explaining even those parts of the philosophy of Aristotle which are clearly false, as Book VIII of the *Physics* concerning celestial movement and Book II of *On the Heavens* concerning the eternity of the heavens—so that a comparison could be made between the philosophy of the gentiles and the truth of Christian dogma. Accordingly, if certain subtleties which are difficult to grasp should not be laid before beginners, or if they should not be preferred to the accepted and necessary teachings, it does not follow that therefore those things should neither be written nor read privately. You can count few academies in which it is a part of the program to explain the *Metaphysics* of Aristotle: yet Aristotle wrote the *Metaphysics* too, a very useful work in the judgment of the professors on all the faculties. Therefore, in order that no one should consider His Most Serene Highness blameworthy, if he observes the rules of the academies, and if he believes that the honor of the academics—even if they have sinned greatly in judgment—should be defended against presumptuous critics, against untimely quarrellers: so in turn I do not let myself be easily persuaded that this most wise Prince will seek to have all people remain publicly and privately inside the boundaries of academic philosophy; and to have no one labor privately in bringing forward these things, that is to say, in the manifestation of the works of God.
>
> But His Most Supreme Highness will not pick a fight concerning the heavens; for he knows that the philosophers speak of the visible heavens; and Christ of the invisible heavens, or, as the schools say, of the empyrean, or, as the simple Christians take it, of the blessed seats, which no corruption will ever touch: since not Tycho, not I, but Christ Himself pronounces concerning this visible world: “Heaven and Earth shall pass away,” and the Psalmist, “they shall grow old like a garment”; and Peter, “They shall be destroyed root and all, and be consumed by burning in the fire.” And that will occur in order that the alterations in the heavens should not destroy their eternity, if there should be such an eternity, just as the terrestrial alterations, which are perennial and return in a circle, destroy the Earth’s eternity which was equally believed by Aristotle. But this kind of argument against Aristotle will perhaps seem too contentious. Therefore let us use his own testimony instead; for he is not everywhere consistent: in the *Metaphysics* he attributes movement to the celestial bodies for its own sake and teaches “that they are moved in order that they may be moved”; but in *On the Heavens*, being admonished by the things themselves, he attributes something or other like the terrestrial, something multiplex and turbulent to the stars or rather to their movers, who by means of these mechanisms and movements seek another end outside of the movement itself, and one mover attains this end with more difficulty than another: in this way, as a matter of fact, he adduces the fewness of movements in the moon as witness of the inferior condition of the moon and its closer kinship to the Earth. For he means to say that the celestial bodies which cannot wholly attain the highest end by their own nature do not employ many motions; and that it would have been wholly useless for the Earth to have a movement to attain that end, but that the Earth is absolutely at rest there; that the moon progresses somewhere and stretches out towards that end; that the higher bodies attain the end, but by many movements; and the highest heaven, by the one simple movement. And so he compares the actions, the *πράξεις* of the moon—that is the word he uses—to the uniform life of plants, but the *πράξεις* of the higher bodies, to the more varied life of animals. Yet he makes all those bodies to be in need of these actions because they have their end and their blessedness outside of themselves. Accordingly, in the epilogue to the Fifth Book of the *Harmonies*, I wish for Aristotle as my reader and critic; as it is not right that I should wish to take up any more of the time of His Most Serene Highness, the highest judgment of the Prince. I am sure of one thing at least, that if he would direct the cultivated power of his mind toward those things which Aristotle wrote and toward my epilogue, everything would be agreed between us, and he would by his own judgment harmonize the discord which now, as you predict, he might feel between us.
>
> In order to counter the envious charge of novelty-hunting, it would be first in my program, even though His Most Serene Highness can easily see all things for himself, to warn him fully of the distinction between the love—or thirst, to use the Aristotelian word—for the knowledge of natural things and the lust for contradicting and holding the opposite opinion. All philosophers, whether Greek or Latin, and all the poets too, recognize a divine ravishment in investigating the works of God: and not merely in investigating them privately but even in teaching them publicly: and it can be inferred that the false charge of esoteric novelty-hunting cannot cling to this ravishment.
> There is God in us, and our warmth comes from His movements: This Spirit has descended from the heavenly seats.
>
> There is no need of this declamation before you, or before His Most Supreme Highness: only I must make some further mention of the boundary posts. For the boundary posts of investigation should not be set up in the narrow minds of a few men. “The world is a petty thing, unless everyone finds the whole world in that which he is seeking,” as Seneca says. But the boundary posts of true speculation are the same as those of the fabric of the world; but

The Christian religion has put up some fences around false speculation which is on the wrong track, in order that error may not rush headlong but may become in other respects harmless in itself. Antiquity teaches us by examples how vainly man sets up boundary posts where God has not set them up: how severely all the astronomers were blamed by the first Christians. Did not Eusebius write of an astronomer that he preferred to desert Christianity—I suppose because he was excommunicated—rather than his profession? Who today would opine that Eusebius is to be imitated? Did not those who taught that there were antipodes seem to Tertullian and to Augustine to be overw^ise? And, indeed, there was a Virgil, Bishop of Salisbury who was removed from his office because he dared to assert this same fact. How many times were the Roman philosophers exiled from the city? And at that, under the ancient manners, wherewith the Roman State was established. Yet today we set up academies everywhere: we order that philosophy be taught, that astronomy be taught, that the antipodes be taught.

But I even in private free myself from the blame of seeking after novelty by suitable proofs: let my doctrines say whether there is love of truth in me or love of glory: for most of the ones I hold have been taken from other writers: I build my whole astronomy upon Copernicus' hypotheses concerning the world, upon the observations of Tycho Brahe, and lastly upon the Englishman, William Gilbert's philosophy of magnetism. If I rejoiced in novelty, I could have devised something like the Fracastorian or Patrician systems. Just as one who rejoices in occupations but rarely in companions, never of himself descends to dice or to a game of chess; similarly for me there is so much importance in the true doctrine of others or even in correcting the doctrines which are not in every respect well established, that my mind is never at leisure for the game of inventing new doctrines that are contrary to the true. Whatever I profess outwardly, that I believe inwardly: nothing is a worse cross for me than—I do not say, to speak what is contrary to my thought—to be unable to utter my inmost sentiments. I know that many innovators are produced by the same affect; but they are easily argued out of the error which seduces them. No one shows that I have committed an error. But because certain people cannot grasp the subtleties of things, they lay the charge of novelty-hunting upon me.

I now descend to the work itself, the *Harmonies*: I do not doubt that he who condemns the itch to devise new things and the presumption to profess new and grandiose things will find in the epilogue to the Fifth Book[^1] that which he will mark critically. For here the sun-spots and little flames are brought forward as evidence of there being exhalations from the sun which are analogous to exhalations from the Earth: here things corresponding to the generation of animals are established as occurring in the planets—here the confines of the mysteries of Christian religion are touched: we knock at the doors of the science of the Magi, of theurgy, of the idolatry of the Persians, and of those who worship the sun as God—as the interjection of frequent warnings does not dissimulate.

Accordingly, if what has been said so far concerning these esoteric things is not satisfactory: at any rate let this be impressed upon His Most Serene Highness: that this chapter contributes nothing in its own right except conjectures; and although it adds a good deal to the form of the work: because—as the opening of the chapter has it—reason itself leads “from the Muses to Apollo”: nevertheless, since the other parts of the work are established by means of their proper demonstrations, the chapter, or epilogue, can be considered as cut off from the rest. For even without the epilogue, the following thesis is upheld by incontrovertible demonstrations: that in the farthest movements of any two planets, the universe was stamped with the adornment of harmonic proportions; and, accordingly, in order that this adornment might be brought into concord with the movements, the eccentricities which fell to the lot of each planet had to be brought into concord. The most wise Prince will easily reckon how great an addition this makes in illustrating the glory of the fabric of the world, and of God the Architect.

But if, however, even this inquiry is accused of being esoteric: I indeed confess that the head of astronomy is struck off. And since astronomy is studied either for its own sake as a philosophy or for the sake of making astronomical predictions; then, if I am to cast my ballot in the question of future contingencies, His Most Serene Highness repudiates any secondary end for this exact and subtle investigation of physical causes which does not offer itself for the uses of daily life: therefore the taking away from me of the primary end slays this whole subtle astronomy and plainly makes it useless.

Nevertheless, in order that I may arm myself against this eventuality also: I will grant that this work of mine, the *Harmonies*, is nothing except as it were a certain picture of the edifice of astronomy; and though it may be erased at the pleasure of him who spits upon it, nevertheless the house called astronomy stands by itself: and I know that astronomy is not condemned by His Most Serene Highness but is held of great value on account of its certitude in predicting movements: perhaps, therefore, he will judge its architect—who is almost the only renovator after the Master Tycho and who thought it worth while to devote his life to this work—to be not unworthy of his favour.

These extracts from the letter, most of which have to do with the investigation of very hidden causes which is to be viewed in this little book, should be spoken and understood. And now it is time for the reader to pass on to the little book.

## BOOK I ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE SCHEMATA
### On the Position, Order, and Movement of the Parts of the World; OR, ON THE *System of the World*

**What is the subject of the doctrine of the schemata?**

The proper movements of the planets; we call them the secondary movements; and the planets, the secondary movables.

**Why do you call them the proper movements of the planets?**

1.  Because the apparent daily movement—with which the doctrine on the sphere is concerned—and which is common to both the planets and the fixed stars, and so to the whole world, is seen to travel from the east to the west; but the far slower single movements of the single planets travel in the opposite direction from west to east; and therefore it is certain that these movements cannot depend upon that common movement of the world—which we have discussed so far—but should be assigned to the planets themselves, and thus they are generically proper to the planets.
2.  But even if in these proper movements of the single planets from west to east there is also present something common, not diurnal but annual, which is extrinsic and betrays that its cause lies in eyesight alone, outside the truth of the thing; and which meanwhile makes the planet in its proper movement have the appearance of retrograding, that is, from east to west, nevertheless because this common movement is so woven into the single periods of the single planets, and so variously transformed, that at first glance you cannot discern what is common to all the planets and what is proper to each: accordingly this whole composite movement of each planet, as it meets the eyes, is said to be proper to each planet specifically; especially since this movement which is common to many does not have its origin in that first common movement of the whole world, but in the proper movement of each planet.

**How many parts are there to the doctrine of the schemata?**

Above (in Book I, page 15), the whole doctrine was divided into its three proper parts: the first, concerning the principles wherewith Copernicus demonstrates the secondary movements—the material of Book IV; the second, concerning the machinery whereby these movements are laid before the eyes, viz., concerning the eccentric and similar circles—the material of Book V; and the third, concerning the apparent movements of the single planets and the common accidents of the planets taken together—the material of Book VI; and the fourth part, which is common to the doctrines on the sphere and on the schemata, concerns the apparent movement of the eighth sphere—the material of Book VII.

**What are the hypotheses or principles wherewith Copernican astronomy saves the appearances in the proper movements of the planets?**

They are principally: (1) that the sun is located at the centre of the sphere of the fixed stars—or approximately at the centre—and is immovable in place; (2) that the single planets move really around the sun in their single systems, which are compounded of many perfect circles revolved in an absolutely uniform movement; (3) that the Earth is one of the planets, so that by its mean annual movement around the sun it describes its orbital circle between the orbital circles of Mars and of Venus; (4) that the ratio of its orbital circle to the diameter of the sphere of the fixed stars is imperceptible to sense and therefore, as it were, exceeds measurements; (5) that the sphere of the moon is arranged around the Earth as its centre, so that the annual movement around the sun—and so the movement from place to place—is common to the whole sphere of the moon and to the Earth.

**Do you judge that these principles should be held to in this *Epitome*?**

Since astronomy has two ends, to save the appearances and to contemplate the true form of the edifice of the world—of which I have treated in Book I, folia 4 and 5—there is no need of all these principles in order to attain the first end: but some can be changed and others can be omitted; however, the second principle must necessarily be corrected: and even though most of these principles are necessary for the second end, nevertheless they are not yet sufficient.

**Which of these principles can be changed or omitted and the appearances still be saved?**

Tycho Brahe demonstrates the appearances with the first and third principles changed: for he, like the ancients, places the Earth immobile, at the centre of the world; but the sun—which even for him is the centre of the orbital circles of the five planets—and the system of all the spheres he makes to go around the Earth in the common annual movement, while at the same time in this common system any planet completes its proper movements. Moreover, he omits the fourth principle altogether and exhibits the sphere of the fixed stars as not much greater than the sphere of Saturn.

**What in turn do you substitute for the second principle and what else do you add to the true form of the dwelling of the world or to what belongs to the nature of the heavens?**

Even though the true movements are to be left singly to the single planets, nevertheless these movements do not move by themselves nor by the revolutions of spheres—for there are no solid spheres—but the sun in the centre of the world, revolving around the centre of its body and around its axis, by this revolution becomes the cause of the single planets going around.

Further, even though the planets are really eccentric to the centre of the sun: nevertheless there are no other smaller circles called epicycles, which by their revolution vary the intervals between the planet and the sun; but the bodies themselves of the planets, by an inborn force (*vi insita*), furnish the occasion for this variation.

**What, then, will the material of Book IV be?**

Book IV will contain celestial physics itself, or the form and proportions of the fabric of the world and the true causes of the movements. This will be the primary function of the astronomer—as we said in Book I, folium 5, namely, the demonstration of his hypotheses.

**Review the principal parts of Book IV.**

There will be three principal parts of Book IV.

The first is on the bodies themselves; the second, on the movements of those bodies; the third, on the real accidents of the movements.

For the first part will teach the conformation of the whole universe, its division into parts or principal regions; the place of the sun at its centre; the number, magnitude, and order or position of the planetary spheres; and lastly, the ratios of all the bodies of the world to one another.

The second part will teach the revolution of the sun around its axis, and its effect in making the planets revolve; the causes of the proportionality of the movements among themselves, i.e., of the periodic times; the immobility of the centre of the sun and the annual movement of the centre of the Earth around the sun; the revolution of the Earth around its axis and its effect in making the moon revolve; the additional help in moving the moon given by the light of the sun; and what the causes of the proportions between the day, month, and year are.

The third part will disclose the causes of the threefold irregularity of the altitude, longitude, and latitude in the single planets—and how these irregularities are doubled in the moon by the force of the illumination from the sun.

## PART I
### 1. On the Principal Parts of the World

**What do you judge to be the layout of the principal parts of the world?**

The *Philosophy of Copernicus* reckons up the principal parts of the world by dividing the figure of the world into regions. For in the sphere, which is the image of God the Creator and the Archetype of the world—as was proved in Book I—there are three regions, symbols of the three persons of the Holy Trinity—the centre, a symbol of the Father; the surface, of the Son; and the intermediate space, of the Holy Ghost. So, too, just as many principal parts of the world have been made—the different parts in the different regions of the sphere: the sun in the centre, the sphere of the fixed stars on the surface, and lastly the planetary system in the region intermediate between the sun and the fixed stars.

**I thought the principal parts of the world are reckoned to be the heavens and the earth?**

Of course, our uncultivated eyesight from the Earth cannot show us any other more notable parts—as was said in Book I, folia 8, 9, 10—since we tread upon the one with our feet and are roofed over by the other, and since both parts seem to be commingled and cemented together in the common limbo of the horizon—like a globe in which stars, clouds, birds, man, and the various kinds of terrestrial animals are enclosed.

But we are practised in the discipline which discloses the causes of things, shakes off the deceptions of eyesight, and carries the mind higher and farther, outside of the boundaries of eyesight. Hence it should not be surprising to anyone that eyesight should learn from reason, that the pupil should learn something new from his master which he did not know before—namely, that the Earth, considered alone and by itself, should not be reckoned among the primary parts of the great world but should be added to one of the primary parts, i.e., to the planetary region, the movable world, and that the Earth has the proportionality of a beginning in that part; and that the sun in turn should be separated from the number of stars and set up as one of the principal parts of the whole universe. But I am speaking now of the Earth in so far as it is a part of the edifice of the world, and not of the dignity of the governing creatures which inhabit it.

**By what properties do you distinguish these members of the great world from one another?**

The perfection of the world consists in light, heat, movement, and the harmony of movements. These are analogous to the faculties of the soul: light, to the sensitive; heat, to the vital and the natural; movement, to the animal; harmony, to the rational. And indeed the adornment (*ornatus*) of the world consists in light; its life and growth, in heat; and, so to speak, its action, in movement; and its contemplation—wherein Aristotle places blessedness—in harmonies. Now since three things necessarily come together for every affection, namely, the cause *a qua*, the subject *in quo*, and the form *sub qua*—therefore, in respect to all the aforesaid affections of the world, the sun exercises the function of the efficient cause; the region of the fixed stars that of the thing forming, containing, and terminating; and the intermediate space, that of the subject—in accordance with the nature of each affection. Accordingly, in all these ways the sun is the principal body of the whole world.

For as regards light: since the sun is very beautiful with light and is as if the eye of the world, like a source of light or very brilliant torch, the sun illuminates, paints, and adorns the bodies of the rest of the world; the intermediate space is not itself light-giving, but light-filled and transparent and the channel through which light is conducted from its source, and there exist in this region the globes and the creatures upon which the light of the sun is poured and which make use of this light. The sphere of the fixed stars plays the role of the river-bed in which this river of light runs, and is as it were an opaque and illuminated wall, reflecting and doubling the light of the sun: you have very properly likened it to a lantern, which shuts out the winds.

Thus in animals the cerebrum, the seat of the sensitive faculty imparts to the whole animal all its senses, and by the act of common sense causes the presence of all those senses as if arousing them and ordering them to keep watch. And in another way, in this simile, the sun is the image of common sense; the globes in the intermediate space of the sense-organs; and the sphere of the fixed stars of the sensible objects.

As regards heat: the sun is the fireplace (*focus*) of the world; the globes in the intermediate space warm themselves at this fireplace, and the sphere of the fixed stars keeps the heat from flowing out, like a wall of the world, or a skin or garment—to use the metaphor of the Psalm of David. The sun is fire, as the Pythagoreans said, or a red-hot stone or mass, as Democritus said—and the sphere of the fixed stars is ice, or a crystalline sphere, comparatively speaking. But if there is a certain vegetative faculty not only in terrestrial creatures but also in the whole ether throughout the universal amplitude of the world—and both the manifest energy of the sun in warming and physical considerations concerning the origin of comets lead us to draw this inference—it is believable that this faculty is rooted in the sun as in the heart of the world, and that thence by the oarage of light and heat it spreads out into this most wide space of the world—in the way that in animals the seat of heat and of the vital faculty is in the heart and the seat of the vegetative faculty in the liver, whence these faculties by the intermingling of the spirits spread out into the remaining members of the body. The sphere of the fixed stars, situated diametrically opposite on every side, helps this vegetative faculty by concentrating heat, as they say; as it were a kind of skin of the world.

As regards movement: the sun is the first cause of the movement of the planets and the first mover of the universe, even by reason of its own body. In the intermediate space the movables, i.e., the globes of the planets, are laid out. The region of the fixed stars supplies the movables with a place and a base upon which the movables are, as it were, supported; and movement is understood as taking place relative to its absolute immobility. So in animals the cerebellum is the seat of the motor faculty, and the body and its members are that which is moved. The Earth is the base of an animal body; the body, the base of the arm or head, and the arm, the base of the finger. And the movement of each part takes place upon this base as upon something immovable.

Finally, as regards the harmony of the movements: the sun occupies that place in which alone the movements of the planets give the appearance of magnitudes harmonically proportioned (*contemperatarum*). The planets themselves, moving in the intermediate space, exhibit the subject or terms, wherein the harmonies are found; the sphere of the fixed stars, or the circle of the zodiac, exhibits the measures whereby the magnitude of the apparent movements is known. So too in man there is the intellect, which abstracts universals and forms numbers and proportions, as things which are not outside of intellect; but individuals (*individua*), received inwardly through the senses are the foundation of universals; and indivisible (*individuae*) and discrete unities, of numbers; and real terms of proportions. Finally, memory, divided as it were into compartments of quantities and times, like the sphere of the fixed stars, is the storehouse and repository of sensations. And further, there is never judgment of sensations except in the cerebrum; and the effect of joy never arises from a sense-perception except in the heart.

Accordingly, the aforesaid vegetating corresponds to the nutritive faculty of animals and plants; heating corresponds to the vital faculty; movement, to the animal faculty; light, to the sensitive; and harmony, to the rational. Wherefore most rightly is the sun held to be the heart of the world and the seat of reason and life, and the principal one among three primary members of the world; and these praises are true in the philosophic sense, since the poets honour the sun as the king of the stars, but the Sidonians, Chaldees, and Persians—by an idiom of language observed in German too—as the queen of the heavens, and the Platonists, as the king of intellectual fire.

**These three members of the world do not seem to correspond with sufficient neatness to the three regions of a sphere: for the centre is a point, but the sun is a body; and the outer surface is understood to be continuous, yet the region of fixed stars does not shine as a totality, but is everywhere sown with shining points discrete from one another; and finally, the intermediate part in a sphere fills the whole expanse, but in the world the space between the sun and the fixed stars is not seen to be set in motion as a whole.**

As a matter of fact, the question indicates the neatest answer concerning the three parts of the world. For since a point could not be clothed or expressed except by some body—and thus the body which is in the centre would fail of the indivisibility of the centre—it was proper that the sphere of the fixed stars should fail of the continuity of a spherical surface, and should burst open in the very minute points of the innumerable fixed stars; and that finally the middle space should not be wholly occupied by movement and the other affections, nor be completely transparent, but slightly more dense, since it could not be altogether empty but had to be filled by some body.

**Are there solid spheres (*orbes*) whereon the planets are carried? And are there empty spaces between the spheres?**

Tycho Brahe disproved the solidity of the spheres by three reasons: the first from the movement of comets; the second from the fact that light is not refracted; the third from the ratio of the spheres.

For if spheres were solid, the comets would not be seen to cross from one sphere into another, for they would be prevented by the solidity; but they cross from one sphere into another, as Brahe shows.

From light thus: since the spheres are eccentric, and since the Earth and its surface—where the eye is—are not situated at the center of each sphere; therefore if the spheres were solid, that is to say far more dense than that very limpid ether, then the rays of the stars would be refracted before they reached our air, as optics teaches; and so the planet would appear irregularly and in places far different from those which could be predicted by the astronomer.

The third reason comes from the principles of Brahe himself; for they bear witness, as do the Copernican, that Mars is sometimes nearer the Earth than the sun is. But Brahe could not believe this interchange to be possible if the spheres were solid, since the sphere of Mars would have to intersect the sphere of the sun.

**Then what is there in the planetary regions besides the planets?**

Nothing except the ether which is common to the spheres and to the intervals: it is very limpid and yields to the movable bodies no less readily than it yields to the lights of the sun and stars, so that the lights can come down to us.

**If it is ether, then it will be a material body having density. Therefore will not its matter resist the movable bodies somewhat?**

On the contrary, the ether is more rarefied than our air, since it is very pure, being spread over a space which is practically immense.

**How do you prove this?**

In optics, by refractions. For our air, which is contiguous to the ether, causes a refraction of approximately 30'. But water contiguous to air causes a refraction of approximately 48°, whence the ratio of the density of water to air, and of air to ether is somehow established by taking the cubes of the numbers. For 30' is contained approximately 100 times in 48°; and in squares, that is, 10,000 times, and in cubes 1,000,000 times. Therefore air is that many times more rarefied than water, and ether than air.

**Nevertheless the matter of the ether is not absolutely null: are the stars therefore still impeded by it?**

We can without any inconvenience grant such a small impediment of movement and such a small resistance of the ether to the movable bodies, just as even before this it must be granted that they offer some resistance on account of the proper matter of their bodies, as will be made clear below. And what if no resistance should be granted to the ether, since it is fairly credible that the ether which surrounds the movable globe the most closely accompanies the globe on account of the very great limpidity (of the ether)?

### 2. On the Place of the Sun at the Centre of the World

**By what arguments do you affirm that the sun is situated at the centre of the world?**

The very ancient Pythagoreans and the Italian philosophers supply us with some of those arguments in Aristotle (*On the Heavens*, Book II, Chapter 13); and these arguments are drawn from the dignity of the sun and that of the place, and from the sun's office of vivification and illumination in the world.

**State the first argument from dignity.**

This is the reasoning of the Pythagoreans according to Aristotle: the more worthy place is due to the most worthy and most precious body. Now the sun—for which they used the word “fire,” as sects purposely hiding their teachings—

[^1]: See *Harmonies of the World*, pp. 1080-1085.

is worthier than the Earth and is the most worthy and most precious body in the whole world, as was shown a little before. But the surface and centre, or midpoint, are the two extremities of a sphere. Therefore one of these places is due to the sun. But not the surface; for that which is the principal body in the whole world should watch over all the bodies; but the centre is suited for this function, and so they used to call it the Watchtower of Jupiter. And so it is not proper that the Earth should be in the middle. For this place belongs to the sun, while the Earth is borne around the centre of its yearly movement.

### What answer does Aristotle make to this argument?

1.  He says that they assume something which is not granted, namely, that the centre [445] of magnitude, *i.e.*, of the sphere, and the centre of the things, *i.e.*, of the body of the world, and so of nature, *i.e.*, of informing or vivifying, are the same. But just as in animals the centre of vivification and the centre of the body are not the same—for the heart is inside but is not equally distant from the surface—we should think in the same way about the heavens, and we should not fear for the safety of the whole universe or place a guard at the centre; rather, we should ask what sort of body the heart of the world of the centre or vivification is and in what place in the world it is situated.
2.  He tries to show the dissimilarity between the midpart of nature and the midpart of place. For the midpart of nature, or the most worthy and precious body, has the proportionality of a beginning. But in the midpart of place is the last, in quantity considered metaphysically, rather than the first or the beginning. For that which is the midpart of quantity, *i.e.*, is the farthest in, is bounded or circumscribed. But the limits are that which bounds or circumscribes. Now that which goes around on the outside, and limits and encloses, is of greater excellence and worth than that which is on the inside and is bounded: for matter is among those things which are bounded, limited, and contained; but form, or the essence of any creature, is of the number of those things which limit, circumscribe, and comprehend. He thinks that he has proved in this way that not so much the midpart of the world as the extremity belongs to the sun, or as he understood it, to the fire of the Pythagoreans.

### How do you rebut this refutation of Aristotle's?

1.  Even if it be true that not in all creatures and least in animals is the principal part of the whole creature at the centre of the whole mass: however, since we are arguing about the world, nothing is more probable than this. For the figure of the world is spherical, and that of an animal is not. For animals need organs extending outside themselves, with which they stand upon the ground, and upon which they may move, and with which they may take within themselves the food, drink, [446] forms of things, and sounds received from outside. The world, on the contrary, is alone, having nothing outside, resting on itself immobile as a whole; and it alone is all things. And so there is no reason why the heart of the world should be elsewhere than in the centre in order that what it is, *viz.*, the heart, might be equally distant from all the farthest parts of the world, that is to say, by an interval everywhere equal.
2.  Furthermore, as regards his telling us to ask what sort of body the principal part of the whole universe is: he is confused by that riddle of the Pythagoreans and believes that they claim that this element is principal. He is not wrong, however, in telling us to do that. And accordingly we, following the advice of Aristotle, have picked out the sun; and neither the Pythagoreans in their mystical sense nor Aristotle himself are against us. And when we ask in what place in the world the sun is situated, Copernicus, as being skilled in the knowledge of the heavens, shows us that the sun is in the midpart. The others who exhibit its place as elsewhere are not forced to do this by astronomical arguments but by certain others of a metaphysical character drawn from the consideration of the Earth and its place. Both we and they set a value upon these arguments; and they themselves too by means of these arguments do not show but seek the place of the sun. So if, when seeking the place of the sun in the world, we find that it is the centre of the world, we are doing just as Aristotle; and his refutation does not apply to us.
3.  As regards the fact that Aristotle, directly contradicting the Pythagoreans, ascribes vileness to the centre, he does that contrary to the nature of figures and contrary to their geometrical or metaphysical consideration.

    For above in Book I, the centre was absolutely not last in the sphere, but wholly its most regular beginning of generation in the mind, and it manifests the likeness of the Holy Trinity, in shadowing forth God the Father, who is the First Person.
4.  Finally it can be seen by anyone that he who judges as a physicist of those things which are geometrical does not do rightly, unless what he questions concerning matter and form [447] had been taken over by analogy from a consideration of geometrical figures. For indeed, in solid quantities the inward corporeality, everywhere spread out equally and not by itself partaking of any figure, is a true image of matter in physical things; but the outward figure of the corporeality, composed of fixed surfaces which bound the solidity, represent the form in physical things. And so this comparison is permitted to him simply; but it appears from that that he plays equivocally with 'midpart' (*medium*). For though the Pythagoreans spoke of the inmost point of the sphere [as the midpart or centre]; he understood the whole space within the surface as comprehended by the word 'midpart.' Accordingly we must grant him the victory as regards the space, but it is a useless victory; for the Pythagoreans and Copernicus win as regards the midpart of all this space. For even if the midpart as a space does not deserve the name of limit; nevertheless as centre it does deserve this name. And in this respect [448] it must be added to the forms and boundaries: since above (in Book I) the centre was the origin of generation of the sphere, metaphysically considered.

### Prove by means of the office of the sun that the centre is due to it.

That has already been partly done in rebutting the Aristotelian refutation. For (1) if the whole world, which is spherical, is equally in need of the light of the sun and its heat, then it would be best for the sun to be at the midpart, whence light and heat may be distributed to all the regions of the world. And that takes place more uniformly and rightly, with the sun resting at the centre than with the sun moving around the centre. For if the sun approached certain regions for the sake of warming them, it would draw away from the opposite regions and would cause alternations while it itself remained perfectly simple. And it is surprising that some people use jokingly the similitude of light at the centre of the lamp, as it is a very apt similitude, least fitted to satirize this opinion but suited rather to painting the power of this argument.

(2) But a special argument is woven together concerning light, which presupposes fitness, not necessity. Imagine the sphere of the fixed stars as a concave mirror: you know that the eye placed at the centre of such a mirror gazes upon itself everywhere: and if there is a light at the centre, it is everywhere reflected at right angles from the concave surface and the reflected rays come together again at the centre. And in fact that can occur at no other point in the concave mirror except at the centre. Therefore, since the sun is the source of light and eye of the world, the centre is due to it in order that the sun—as the Father in the divine symbolizing—may contemplate itself in the whole concave surface—which is the symbol of God the Son—and take pleasure in the image of itself, and illuminate itself by shining and inflame itself by warming. These melodious little verses apply to the sun:

    Thou who dost gaze at thy face
    and dost everywhere leap back
    from the navel of the upper air
    O gushing up of the gleams flowing
    through the glass emptiness, Sun,
    who dost again swallow thy reflections.

### Nevertheless Copernicus did not place the sun exactly at the centre of the world?

It was the intention of Copernicus to show that this node common to all the planetary systems—of which node we shall speak below—is as far distant from the centre of the sun as the ancients made the eccentricity of the sun to be. He established this node as the centre of the world, and was compelled to do so by no astronomical demonstration but on account of fitness alone, in order that this node and, as it were, the common centre of the mobile spheres would not differ from the very centre of the world. But if anyone else, in applying this same fitness, wished to contend that we should rather fear to make the sun differ from the centre of the world, and that it was sufficient that this node of the region of the moving planets should be situated very near, even if not exactly at the centre—anyone who wished to make this contention, I say, would have raised no disturbance in Copernican astronomy. So, firstly, the last arguments concerning the place of the sun at the centre are nevertheless unaffected by this opinion of Copernicus concerning the distance of this node from the sun. But secondly, we must not agree to the opinion of Copernicus that this node is distant from the centre of the sun. For the common node of the region of the mobile planets is in the sun, as will be proved below; and so by some probable arguments either the one or the other point is set down at the centre of the sphere of the fixed stars, and by the same arguments the other point is brought to the same place, even with the approval of Copernicus.

## 3. On the Order of the Movable Spheres

### How are the planets divided among themselves?

Into the primary and the secondary. The primary planets are those whose bodies are borne around the sun, as will be shown below; the secondary planets are those whose own circles are arranged not around the sun but around one of the primary planets and who also share in the movement of the primary planet around the sun. Saturn is believed to have two such secondary planets and to draw them around with itself: they come into sight now and then with the help of a telescope. Jupiter has four such planets around itself: D, F, H. The Earth (B) has one (C) called the moon. It is not yet clear in the case of Mars, Venus, and Mercury whether they too have such a companion or satellite.

### Then how many planets are to be considered in the doctrine on schemata?

No more than seven: the six so-called primary planets: (1) Saturn, (2) Jupiter, (3) Mars, (4) the Earth—the sun to eyesight, (5) Venus, (6) Mercury, and (7) only one of the secondary planets, the moon, because it alone revolves around our home, the Earth; the other secondary planets do not concern us who inhabit the Earth, [451] and we cannot behold them without excellent telescopes.

### In what order are the planets laid out: are they in the same heaven or in different heavens?

Eyesight places them all in that farthest and highest sphere of the fixed stars and opines that they move among the fixed stars. But reason persuades men of all times and of all sects that the case is different. For if the centres of all the planets were in the same sphere and since we see that to sight they are fairly often in conjunction with one another: accordingly one planet would impede the other, and their movements could not be regular and perpetual.

But the reasoning of Copernicus and ancient Aristarchus, which relies upon observations, proves that the regions of the single planets are separated by very great intervals from one another and from the fixed stars.

### What is the difference here between the reasoning of Copernicus and that of the ancients?

1.  The reasoning of the ancients is merely probable, but the demonstration of Copernicus, arising from his principles, brings necessity.
2.  They teach only that there is not more than one planet in any one sphere: Copernicus further adds how great a distance any planet must necessarily be above another.
3.  Now the ancients built up one heaven upon another, like layers in a wall, or, to use a closer analogy, like onion skins: the inner supports the outer; for they thought that all intervals had to be filled by spheres and that the higher sphere must be set down as being only as great as the lower sphere of a known magnitude allows; and that is only a material conformation. Copernicus, having measured by his observation the intervals between the single spheres, showed that there is such a great distance between two planetary spheres, that it is unbelievable that it should be filled with spheres. And so this lay-out of his urges the speculative mind to spurn matter and the contiguity of spheres and to look towards the investigation of the formal lay-out or archetype, with reference to which the intervals were made.
4.  The ancients, with their material structure, were forced to make the planetary or mobile world many parts greater than Copernicus was forced to do with his formal lay-out. But Copernicus, on the contrary, made the region of the mobile planets not very large, while he made the motionless sphere of the fixed stars immense. The ancients do not make it much greater than the sphere of Saturn.
5.  The ancients do not explain and confirm as they desire the reason for their lay-out; Copernicus establishes his lay-out excellently by reasons.

### What do you mean by the reasons for the lay-out of the spheres, and how is Copernicus outstanding in this respect?

Aristotle teaches in *On the Heavens* (Book II, Chapter 10) that nothing is more consonant with reason than that the times of revolution of each planet should correspond to the altitude or amplitude of its sphere. Now for the ancients, the highest planet was the same as the slowest, namely, Saturn, because it takes 30 years. Jupiter follows it in place and in time, and takes 2 years; Mars, which takes less than 2 years, follows Jupiter. But for the ancients, this proportionality was changed in the remaining planets. For unless you grant to the Earth an annual movement around the sun, then the sun, Venus, and Mercury—three distinct planets—have the same time of revolution of a year, nevertheless they give them different spheres: the upper to the sun, the middle to Venus, and the third to Mercury. Finally they give the lowest place to the moon, as it takes the shortest time, namely a month.

But Copernicus, postulating that the Earth moves around the sun, keeps the same proportion of movement and time in all the planets. For him the sun

Schema of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and the Earth

[454] Schema of the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, with orbit of the Earth enlarged

is at the centre of the world and is thus the farthest in; it is without the revolution of the centre, that is to say, it is motionless with respect to the centre and the axis. But a few years after this, the body [453] of the sun was perceived to move around its motionless axis more quickly than the space of one month. Mercury, the nearest, circles around the sun in the smallest sphere and completes its revolution in 3 months; around this sphere moves Venus in a larger sphere and in a longer period of time, *viz.*, 7½ months. Around the heaven of Venus moves the Earth with its satellite the moon—for the moon is a secondary planet, whose proportionality is not counted among the primary planets—and it revolves in a period of 12 months. After, follow Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, as with the ancients, each with its satellite. After Saturn, comes the sphere of the fixed stars—and it is distant by such an immense interval that it is absolutely at rest.

### What measure does Copernicus use in measuring the intervals of the single planets?

We must use a measure so proportioned that the other spheres can be compared, a measure very closely related to us and thus somehow known to us: such is the amplitude of the sphere whereon the centre of the Earth and the little sphere of the moon revolve—or its semidiameter, the distance of the Earth from the sun. This distance, like a measuring rod, is suitable for the business. For the Earth is our home; and from it we measure the distances of the heavens; and it occupies the middle position among the planets and for many reasons—on which below—it obtains the proportionality of a beginning among them. [455] But the sun, by the evidence and judgment of our sight, is the principal planet. But by the vote of reason cast above, the sun is the heart of the region of moving planets proposed for measurement. And so our measuring rod has two very signal termini, the Earth and the sun.

### How great therefore are the intervals between the single spheres?

The Copernican demonstrations show that the distance of Saturn is a little less than ten times the Earth's from the sun; that of Jupiter, five times; that of Mars, one and one-half times; that of Venus, three-quarters; and that of Mercury, approximately one-third.

And so the diameter of the sphere of Saturn is less than twice the length of its neighbour Jupiter's; the diameter of Jupiter is three times that of the lower planet Mars; the diameter of Mars is one and one-half times that of the terrestrial sphere placed around the sun; the diameter of the Earth's sphere is more than one and one-third that of Venus; and that of Venus is approximately five-thirds or eight-fifths that of Mercury. However, it should be noted that the ratios of the distances are different in other parts of the orbits, especially in the case of Mars and Mercury.

### What is the cause of the planetary intervals upon which the times of the periods follow?

The archetypal cause of the intervals is the same as that of the number of the primary planets, being six.

### I implore you, you do not hope to be able to give the reasons for the number of the planets, do you?

This worry has been resolved, with the help of God, not badly. Geometrical reasons are co-eternal with God—and in them there is first the difference between the curved and the straight line. Above (in Book I) it was said that the curved somehow bears a likeness to God; the straight line represents creatures. And first in the adornment of the world, the farthest region of the fixed stars has been made spherical, in that geometrical likeness of God, because as a corporeal God—worshipped by the gentiles under the name of Jupiter—it had to contain all the remaining things in itself. Accordingly, rectilinear [456] magnitudes pertained to the inmost contents of the farthest sphere; and the first and most beautiful magnitudes to the primary contents. But among rectilinear magnitudes the first, the most perfect, the most beautiful, and most simple are those which are called the five regular solids. [457] More than 2,000 years ago Pythagoreans said that these five were the figures of the world, as they believed that the four elements and the heavens—the fifth essence—were conformed to the archetype for these five figures.

But the truer reason for these figures including one another mutually is in order that these five figures may conform to the intervals of the spheres. Therefore, if there are five spherical intervals, it is necessary that there be six spheres: just as with four linear intervals, there must necessarily be five digits.

### What are these five regular figures?

The cube, tetrahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron, and octahedron.

### How are these figures divided, and into what classes?

The cube, tetrahedron, and dodecahedron are primary; the octahedron and the icosahedron are secondary.

### Why do you make the former primary and the latter secondary?

The three former figures have a prior origin, and the most simple angle (*i.e.*, trilinear), and their own proper planes. The two latter have their origin in the primary figures, and a more composite angle made from many lines, and borrowed planes.

### What is the order of the primary figures?

They are said to be primary merely with respect to the secondary; but even among themselves they have this order of priority: cube, tetrahedron, dodecahedron. For in those figures there appears the first of all metaphysical oppositions, that between the same and the other, or the different. Sameness is seen in the cube, and difference in the remaining two figures; and between these figures there is also the first geometrical contrariety, namely, the contrariety between the greater-than and less-than. For the cube is [458] the thing itself (*res ipsa*); the tetrahedron is less than the cube, and the dodecahedron is greater than the cube; or, the cube is the first solid figure generated, the tetrahedron is the first of the solid figures cut out of the cube, and the dodecahedron is the first of the composite figures made by adding to, and covering over, the cube. This same idea is dominant in their planes: the tetragon, the triangle, and the pentagon. For the tetragon is generated first of all by drawing the most simple and regular lines, as was said in Book I; and it is broken up into two triangles; but the pentagon is composed of three suitable triangles.

### Explain the generation, primacy, and form of the cube.

Rectilinear magnitudes have an origin visible to the mind; the spherical, as was said above, brings a certain character of eternity or of eternal generation. For with a sphere postulated, the point at its centre is postulated, and so are the infinite points on its surface. Therefore, line arises from the flowing of point to point; surface arises from the sideways flowing of the line; and body, from the sideways flowing of the surface. If the flowing of the point is straight and also the shortest, there arises a straight line bounded by two points. If the flowing of the straight line is such that all its points flow equally, a parallelogram arises bounded by four lines; and if the parallelogram flows in the same way, the parallelepiped arises, bounded by six planes. Again, if the flowing of the line is equal to the flowing straight line, and the line along which the flowing takes place makes any angle with the flowing line except a right angle, there arises the plane called the rhomboid, whose sides are equal. But if the line makes a right angle, it is a square which arises. And if the square also flows, there arises the cube, the six planes of which are all squares and are thus equal to one another. Now the shortest is prior to the crooked; and the equal and similar is prior to the unequal and dissimilar, and the straight, or right, to the oblique. Therefore, in this way among the lines generated, the straight line is prior—for the circle is posterior to the plane, and the plane to the straight line; and among surfaces the square is prior. Thus among magnitudes, that which exists perfectly [459] (*i.e.*, with three dimensions), that is to say, the cube, is shown to be first among bodies.

### Explain the primacy of the tetrahedron among the segments, and the mode of section of the cube, and its form.

By subtracting from the bodies, so that something lesser exists, the other solid figures usually come to be. We must judge that the first of them is the solid figure which exists if the first figure generated (*viz.*, the cube) is cut most simply and most equally. But the section—among the sections which designate a new plane figure—is not equal or more simple than when you cut through four angles of the cube completely. For you are cutting out the same number of equilateral tetrahedrons—and the single tetrahedrons A, C, and D have a solid right angle B above the triangular base. There remains as it were the bowels of the cube, namely, the fifth tetrahedron, similar to itself in all respects, and bounded by four equilateral triangles. But if you make the section of the cube of which I have spoken in Book I, there will not be five but six irregular tetrahedrons. So the tetrahedron is the first figure coming from the decreasing of the bodies. But it is a third part of the body of the cube cut, and any angle cut away, such as BACD, is the sixth part of the same whole.

[460] Explain the origin of the dodecahedron by addition, and give the reasons for its posteriority among the three primary bodies, and its priority among the bodies generated by addition.

As in subtracting from the cube, four planes are constructed in place of the four angles of the cube which have been cut off; four angles remain to the tetrahedron, but the angles are decreased and are still of the same species (*i.e.*, trilinear), so too, if we wish to construct the first of the increased bodies, or of those which are greater than the cube, in place of the planes of the cube we construct angles, but we transmit the angles of the cube as clothed and increased, though they also remain trilinear; or, what leads to the same thing, upon the twelve sides of the cube the same numbers of planes are to be built, just as, in the former case, upon the six sides of the tetrahedron the same number of squares were built. For as the cube roofs over the tetrahedron, so this increased solid figure which we are investigating roofs over the cube.

[461] But if instead of the single planes of the cube we set up single angles—if we set up six quadrilinear angles, because the six planes of the cube are quadrilaterals—the eight trilinear angles of the cube remain. Therefore the figure would be mixed. Therefore in order that the trilinear angle may remain in the augmented figure, two angles are to be constructed upon the single planes of the cube—and not one angle alone; that is to say, six prisms, such as the former one BCAED, not six pyramids, such as the one here, BADC. And in order that there may always be one plane common to two contiguous prisms, let this plane be constructed across one side of the cube. And these six prisms are slightly less than the cube upon which they are placed. And so by the augmentation twelve angles are made—and by the addition of the eight angles of the cube, the sum of the angles is twenty.

Here AE, ED, and the remaining dotted lines are the sides of the roofed-over cube, AED is the plane of the cube; and the two angles B and C come to be instead of it; and

### How do you infer the form of the plane of the dodecahedron?

The angles of the figure, as was said already, should be twenty; and each single angle is bounded by three lines, any one of which adjoins two angles; and

A and E the angles of the cube remain. But upon the side of the cube AE, the pentagon ABCE is constructed, as upon the side ED, the pentagon BCD.

so there are twenty times three or sixty points. But two points determine one line. Therefore there are thirty lines or sides to the figure, and there are potentially sixty with respect to the planes of the figure. For any side of the figure adjoins two planes. But the division of the sixty lines or plane sides by the twelve planes—which are necessary for this solid figure—gives a quotient of five. Therefore the planes are quinquelateral. So among the augmented figures the dodecahedron, having pentagonal planes, is again first.

### What is the origin of the secondary figures and why are there only two?

Three other figures correspond to the cube, the tetrahedron, and the dodecahedron; but one of them coincides with its primary figure. And these secondary figures are generated by subtracting from the three primary figures, but by subtraction of a different kind, where a line is not left in the place of the plane, but an angle, *i.e.*, in the place of the surface of the primary figure, there is—not a line of the secondary figure, but—a point; while the number of lines remains. But at the same time—as before—a plane of the secondary figure is generated in place of the angle of the primary figure. And the plane is triangular, because the angle of the primary figure is trilinear, and by joining together the centres of three planes of the primary figure a solid angle is constructed. So these figures are generated secondly as if the bowels of the first figures.

For whatever appears outwardly falls away from the cube, and there remain of the cube only six centres, as it were the navels of six planes. And there are six angles to the new figure. And because the cube has eight angles, the figure gets eight plane equilateral triangles in their place. Hence it is called an octahedron; and it is the sixth part of its cube.

As regards the tetrahedron: in place of its plane triangles four angles are constructed; and in place of its four angles four triangles are constructed; and a figure arises which is the same as its primary figure. And so it is not judged to be new. However, it is the twenty-seventh part of the tetrahedron in which it is inscribed.

As regards the dodecahedron: in place of the twelve bases it gives the twelve angles of the new figure; and in place of its twenty angles it gives twenty triangular bases: whence the figure is called an icosahedron. And it is slightly less than half the size of its original dodecahedron.

### One of the primary figures was produced by subtracting from the cube; and one by adding to the cube. And now the secondary figures are generated by subtracting from these two primary figures. Is nothing produced by adding to the secondary figures?

To this second subtraction there also corresponds a second addition to those three primary figures—an angle arising in place of the plane, and a plane in place of the angle. But the figures are the same as those produced by former subtraction. For just as formerly the octahedron was inscribed in the cube, and the icosahedron in the dodecahedron: so now in turn the cube is made to be inscribed in the octahedron, and the dodecahedron in the icosahedron. Accordingly, when all these operations have been performed, the first five figures are found.

### Why do you call them the most simple figures?

Because each of them is bounded by planes of one species alone, *viz.*, triangles or quadrilaterals or pentagons, and by solid angles of one species alone—the three primary figures by the trilinear angle, the octahedron by the quadrilinear angle, and the icosahedron by the quinquelinear angle. The other figures vary either with respect to the angle or with respect to the plane. For there are some which have one genus of planes, as the rhombus in this diagram, but no one genus of solid angles. For the dodecahedral rhombus has six quadrilinear angles and eight trilinear angles; and the thirty-sided rhombus has twelve quinquelinear angles and twenty trilinear angles. There are other figures which mingle diverse planes having uniform solid angles, as the thirteen species of the Archimedean solids.

### Why do you call those five figures the most beautiful and the most perfect?

Because they imitate the sphere—which is an image of God—as much as a rectilinear figure possibly can, arranging all their angles in the same sphere. And they can all be inscribed in a sphere. And as the sphere is everywhere similar to itself, so in this case the planes of any one figure are all similar to one another, and can be inscribed in one and the same circle; and the angles are equal.

### Is there not some other method by which more figures similar to these can be constructed?

None at all. For a solid angle of any figure is constructed from at least three planes. Accordingly, equilateral triangles can join with triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons in order to form a solid angle; quadrilaterals, with triangles; and pentagons, similarly with triangles. But six triangles, or three hexagons, complete a surface, and cannot form a solid angle. But magnitudes larger than these, as three heptagons, or three of any other figure, exceed the sum of four right angles which are laid around the same point in a plane. See the scholium to the last proposition in *Book XIII* of *Euclid* and *Book II* of my *Harmonies*.

### Then how are the number of the primary spheres and the intervals of the planetary orbits taken from these figures?

Any solid figure is understood to have two spheres, one circumscribed around it and the other touching the centres of its planes; whence the first view of the solid figure as it were invites some architect to circumscribe and to inscribe spheres. So whatever the ratio of the outer sphere to the inner sphere is, that has been made to be the ratio of the sphere of the upper planet to the nearest lower sphere, between which spheres there is the aforesaid interval.

### What are the ratios of the spheres in the single figures?

Let the semidiameter of the circumscribed sphere be 100,000. The ratio of the semidiameter of the inscribed sphere is as follows:

- In the cube 57,735 The square is equal to one-third of the square on the radius of the circumscribed sphere.
- In the tetrahedron 33,333 One-third of the radius of the circumscribed sphere.
- In the dodecahedron 79,465 An irrational part, the square on which is between two-thirds and three-fifths of the square on the radius of the circumscribed sphere: namely, by the subtraction of the square on the apotome from eleven-fifteenths of the square on the radius.
- In the icosahedron 79,465 The square is equal to one-third of the square on the radius of the circumscribed sphere.
- In the octahedron 57,735

But the octahedron has at the middle section of itself a square formed by the four lines bounding it in the middle, and if a circle is inscribed in this square, its radius will be 70,711, the square on which is equal to half the square on the radius of the circumscribed circle.

### Show now what the place of the sphere of the Earth is among these figures.

The five bodies were distributed into two classes above: into those generated first, and those generated second. The former had a trilinear angle, and the latter a plurilinear. For as Adam was the first-born, and Eve was not his daughter but a part of him—and they are both called the first-made, but Cain and Abel and their sisters are their offspring; so the cube is in the first place, wherefrom have arisen, differently and more simply, the tetrahedron—as it were a rib of the cube—and the dodecahedron, but in such a way that all three remain among the primary figures. The octahedron and the icosahedron, with their triangular planes, are as it were the offspring born of the cube and dodecahedron as fathers and from the tetrahedron as mother; and each of them bears a likeness to its parent.

So the three first figures of the same class had to enclose the circuit of the centre of the Earth and the two figures generated second, as the other class, should be enclosed by the sphere in which the Earth revolves, and so this sphere had to be made a boundary common to both orders, because the Earth, the home of the image of God, was going to be chief among the moving globes. For in this way the nature of being inscribed is kept in the second class and that of circumscribing in the first class. For it is more natural and more fitting that the octahedron should be inscribed in the cube, and the icosahedron in the dodecahedron, than the cube in the octahedron, and the dodecahedron in the icosahedron.

And so in this way the circuit of the centre of the Earth was placed in the middle between the planets; for three planets had to be placed outside, on account of the three primary figures; and two had to be placed inside its circuit—on account of the two figures of the second class—to which the sun is added as a third in the inmost embrace of the centre of the mobile spheres. And so Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars were made the higher planets, and Venus, Mercury, and the sun, the lower. But the moon, which has a private movement around the Earth during the same common circuit of the Earth, is among the secondary planets, as was said above.

### What is the order among the three outer figures and what place among the planets does each hold?

The cube is the first of the figures, and therefore it was placed between the two farthest spheres, those of Saturn and Jupiter. In the generation of the figures the tetrahedron follows: therefore, it got the place between Jupiter and Mars. The dodecahedron was the last of the three: therefore, the last place was assigned to it between the orbital regions of Mars and of the Earth.

### How do you place the two inner figures?

Although the octahedron has the nature of the cube, of which it is the first parts, and the icosahedron that of the dodecahedron, of which it is the last parts; nevertheless the next place after the dodecahedron did not belong to the octahedron, for two reasons. For, first, the two classes of figures are somehow opposed to one another: therefore it was fitting that the beginning of the placing should be at the opposite termini. But since the first place of the outer figures was judged to be the place which tended the more outward; consequently the first place of the inner figures was judged to be the place which tended the more to the interior towards the centre. Secondly, it was more becoming to the nature of the similar figures, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, and better suited to their being inscribed within one another, that they should succeed one another very closely, with the circuit or sphere of the Earth coming in between, at which as at a common boundary both classes of figures stop.

Therefore it was caused that the icosahedron should be placed between the orbits of the Earth and of Venus, but the octahedron between the inmost orbits, those of Venus and Mercury. But the sun does not have a sphere in which its centre is carried around; and therefore it is outside the number of the primary moving bodies, but it has in itself the source of the movement; the fixed stars have stillness in themselves, and they furnish a place for the moving bodies and contain them.

### Is there found between these spheres which you have given to each figure the ratio of the figures?

There is found so much the same ratio that, although there is some very small deficiency, nevertheless no interval between two planets approaches nearer to the ratios of the spheres of another figure than those intervals which have been ascribed with the best of reasons to the two planets.

For you see that as Saturn's sphere had less than twice the diameter of the sphere of Jupiter, and Venus's similarly had less than twice the diameter of Mercury's, namely, five-thirds or eight-fifths; so also in the cube and in the octahedron 100,000 is less than twice 57,735. For if you take three-fifths of 100,000 you will have 60,000; but if you take five-eighths, then 62,500 will be the result. Again, as the sphere of Mars had a very small ratio to the sphere which carries the centre of the Earth, and one nearly equal to the ratio of the sphere of the Earth to that of Venus; so too you will see between the spheres of the dodecahedron and of the icosahedron a very small ratio, namely, that of 100,000 to 79,465. You see, thirdly, that, just as the sphere of Jupiter has a very great ratio to the sphere of Mars, namely triple; so too, in the case of the tetrahedron the diameter of the circumscribed sphere is three times the diameter of the inscribed sphere.

### If the intervals approach so nearly to the ratios of the figures, why then does some discrepancy remain?

1.  Because the archetype of the movable world is constituted not only of the five regular [solid] figures—by which the chariots of the planets and the number of the courses were determined—but also of the harmonic proportions with which the courses themselves were attuned, as it were, to the idea of celestial music or of a harmonic concord of six voices. Now since this musical ornamentation demanded a difference of movement in any given planet—a difference between the slowest and the fastest movement; and this difference is made by the variation of the interval between the planet and the sun; and since the magnitude or ratio of this variation was required to be different in different planets; hence it was necessary that some very small amount should be taken away from the intervals which are exhibited by the figures as uniform and without variation, and that it should be left to the freedom of the composer to represent the harmonies of movement.

2.  And nevertheless that which the regular solids have of their very own was not neglected in this very small discrepancy. For just as the ratio of the spheres of the tetrahedron is perfect, *i.e.*, rational simply, that of the cube and the octahedron, half-perfect, *i.e.*, rational in square but irrational in length, but that of the dodecahedron and of the icosahedron are wholly imperfect, *i.e.*, absolutely irrational; so also the ratio of the tetrahedral planets imitates the figure almost exactly, *i.e.*, in approximately the extremities of the intervals. But the ratios of the cubic and octahedral planets are less exactly like the figures, because the extreme intervals recede from the figures while the intermediate intervals square with them. But the whole intervals of the dodecahedral and icosahedral planets abandon the ratios of their figures, although they approach no others more nearly. Now see how the longest interval of Mars is almost exactly a third part of the least interval of Jupiter, as in the tetrahedron the [diameter of the] inside sphere is one-third [of the diameter] of the outer sphere: so that in this way if the angles of the tetrahedron are placed in the inmost sphere of Jupiter, the tetrahedral planes somehow touch the farthest sphere of Mars. See again how if the angles of the cube are placed in the sphere of Saturn and the angles of the octahedron in the inmost sphere of Venus, the planes of the figures sink into the regions [i.e., spheres] of Jupiter and Mercury, and do not pass above the total regions but enter in approximately as far as the middle. Finally, see how, if the angles of the dodecahedron are placed in the inmost sphere of Mars and the angles of the icosahedron in the inmost sphere of the Earth, the planes of the figures by no means reach to the inscribed regions of the Earth and of Venus, but that nevertheless no planetary intervals approach more nearly to the least ratios of these figures. Concerning these things, see my *Harmonies* (*Book V, Proposition XLIX* and *passim*), where the causes not only of the exact magnitude of the ratios between two spheres but also of the opposite intervals of any single planet are dug up.

### No other conclusion concerning the interposition of the figures can be drawn from the periodic times, can it?

All ratios of time in this case are greater than the ratios of their orbits and also greater than the ratios of their figures, as will be unfolded in the second part of this book. Nevertheless the property of the figures can be recognized without difficulty even among the time ratios. For as there are three ratios among the figures—the greatest ratio which is alone, and the middle and the least, which are both found in two cases—the greatest ratio is found in the tetrahedron alone, the middle ratio in the cube and the octahedron, and the least ratio in the dodecahedron and the icosahedron; so the greatest and the solitary ratio of times is found between Jupiter and Mars, approximately that of 6 to 1, nearly 12 years to less than 2 years, an argument for the interposition of the tetrahedron. But between Saturn and Jupiter and between Venus and Mercury the ratio of times is less and in both cases approximately the same, an argument for the interposition of the cognate bodies, in the first case the cube and in the second case the octahedron, which have approximately the same ratios between their spheres. For as the 30 years of Saturn are to the 12 years of Jupiter, so approximately are the 225 days of Venus to the 88 days of Mercury. And finally there is the least ratio of times between Mars and the Earth and between the Earth and Venus, and again it is practically the same in both cases, an argument for the interposition, in the first case of the dodecahedron, and in the second case of the icosahedron, which are bodies cognate and having the same ratio. For as the 687 days of Mars are to the 365 1/4 days of the Earth, so the 365 1/4 days are to 194 days, since instead of these Venus has 225 days, a little more, and makes the least time ratio of all. The causes of such a small discrepancy are unfolded in my *Harmonies* (*Book V*).

### You do not have any other evidence, do you, except that from the two classes of figures that the globe of the Earth has the principal proportionality in location?

Indeed it is not by chance that the mean interval between the Earth, the middle planet, and the sun is found to be almost exactly a mean proportional between the shortest interval of Mars, the lowest of the higher planets, and the longest interval of Venus, the highest of the lower planets. For, as was said above, the space between Mars and Venus was left for the Earth—left undetermined by the inscribing of figures and open and free, so that in dividing it by the sphere of the Earth, either this ratio or some other, if the other were better, could be expressed. Therefore the mean in the classes of the figures, and the middle wall between the higher and the lower planets had to be a mean geometrically too.

### Then what determined this interval which the inscribings did not determine?

Even if there is a certain augmented figure, the *aculeate* or wedge-shaped dodecahedron, which is taken as determining this interval as accurately as the interval between Jupiter and Mars is determined by the tetrahedron, and the relationship of that imperfect figure with its cognates, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, is seen not to lack its proper ratio; nevertheless the figures alone do not determine these intervals or any others exactly, but this job was left to the ornament of harmonic movements, which demands a certain amount of freedom in determining these intervals exactly.

## 4. On the Ratios of the Principal Bodies of the World to One Another

### Where do you judge that the beginning should be made in investigating the ratios of bodies?

From the Earth (1) as the home of the speculative creature, and (2) of the same image of God the Creator; (3) for we read in the holy Book of Moses that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth; (4) moreover, the sphere of the Earth is the middle figure between the planets, and their common boundary, and even a geometrical mean proportional between the territories of the higher and the lower planets; (5) finally, the very structure of these ratios cries in a loud voice that God the Creator in fitting the bodies and intervals to the solar body, as to a measure prior to their generation, made His beginning at the Earth.

### What do you judge to be the reason for the magnitude of the solar body?

The following things argue that the solar globe is the first of all the bodies of the world in the order of creation, at least in the archetypal order; if not also in the temporal: (1) Moses makes light the work of the first day, and instead of light we can understand the solar body. (2) Above by many votes, the solar body obtained the *principate* among natural things; why not also in quantity and in time, in which it was created?

Furthermore, the first body, because first, does not acquire any ratio to the bodies following; but rather the bodies following acquire a ratio to it as first. Therefore there is no archetypal cause of the magnitude of the sun: nor could there have been a different globe twice as great as it is now, because the rest of the universe and the whole world and man in it would have had to be twice as great as they now are.

### Then by what means was the magnitude of the Earth adjusted to the solar globe?

By means of vision of the sun. For the Earth was going to be the home of the speculative creature, and for his sake the universe and world have been made. But now speculation has its origin in the vision of the stars: wherefore too the magnitude of the things to be contemplated had to have its origin in the magnitude of the things to be seen. But the first visible is light or the sun, as it is (1) the work of the first day and (2) the most excellent of all visible things, the principal, the primary, and that which was going to be the cause of the visibility of all the rest. So it follows that the beginning [*principium*] in proportioning the bodies of the world was taken from the vision of the sun from the Earth; just as in the case of the upper planets the regions of the world were separated by the mean proportionality of the orbit of the Earth.

### How great does the diameter of the sun appear to be on the Earth?

It is established by the very old observations of Aristarchus and by the most recent of our time, that, if the Earth is at its greatest distance from the sun, and with the point of vision E as centre a circle is described, then exactly one-seven-hundred-twentieth of that circle, *i.e.*, is occupied and so to speak defined by the diameter of the sun; or, what is the same thing, the angle comprehended by the lines touching each rim of S the sun, is one-seven-hundred-twentieth of four right angles.

### What do you think is the reason for this number?

We must seek the archetypal cause of the first thing among the first causes. But there is no geometrical cause for the division of a circle into 720 parts in a figure lacking that number of sides. For this figure is derived by bisection from a figure having 45 sides; and there is no [geometrical] demonstration of that figure, as is proved in the *Harmonies*, *Book I*. It follows that this sectioning of the circle is taken from the composition of figures and so from harmonic ratios. And it seems to bring about the necessity that the circle of the zodiac, wherein all the planets had to practise their harmonic movements in reality and the sun in appearance—that this circle, I say, should be divided into parts of a harmonic numbering by the appearance of the first body. But the least number which offers itself in determining all the parts of the monochord and in setting up the twofold scale of the octave [*systema diapason duplex*], *i.e.*, in the minor and the major mode—I say that this number is 720, as was shown in the *Harmonies*, *Book III, Chapter 6*.

> In Kepler's musical system, if the intervals in the octave are represented by assigning whole numbers to the eight tones in such fashion that the ratio between any two numbers will express the analogous musical interval, then the minor scale will be represented by the following sequence, in least numbers:
> 72 : 81 : 90 : 96 : 108 : 120 : 128 : 144
> Similarly, the major scale, as follows:
> 360 : 405 : 432 : 480 : 540 : 576 : 640 : 720
> Now if the two scales are combined, “the twofold scale of the octave, *i.e.*, in the minor and the major mode" thus produced will be represented by the following sequence, in least whole numbers:
> 360 : 405 : 432 : 450 : 480 : 640 : 576 : 600 : 640 : 720

Wherefore, since the movements of all the planets, as I show in *Book V* of the *Harmonies*, had to be adjusted to this twofold scale; it was fitting that the first body, which was the leader of the dance to this music, by its apparent diameter on the Earth, should, in the eyes of the Earth-dweller—*i.e.*, the speculative creature—divide that circle as an index and measure of the apparent harmonic movements, by the division of the monochord, *i.e.*, by the division into 720 parts, which is twice 360, thrice 240, four times 180, five times 144, six times 120, eight times 90, nine times 80, ten times 72, twelve times 60, fifteen times 48, sixteen times 45, eighteen times 40, twenty times 36, twenty-four times 30, by a multiplex form of division into aliquot parts.

### Then what follows in respect to the interval between the sun and the Earth from the assumption of this hypothesis? or, what is the magnitude of this rod used by us heretofore as a measure of the planetary spheres?

If S the diameter of the sun had to occupy with the point of vision E set up on the Earth; it is necessary that the point of vision, or in place of it E the centre of the terrestrial globe, should be distant from the centre of the Sun S to the extent of a little more than 229 semidiameters of the round body of the Sun S, as we are taught in geometry.

### I have the interval; tell me also the magnitude of the terrestrial globe and give reasons.

These things are not yet sufficient to determine the magnitude of the Earth; but it is the work of one axiom added to another. Without doubt, because the Earth was going to be the home of the measuring creature; and the Earth by its body had to become the measure of the bodies of the world, and by its semidiameter the measure of the intervals, as the line is the measure of lines. But since the measuring of bodies is different from the measuring of lines, and since the ratio between the terrestrial body and the solar body is first, as is the ratio

Between the diameter of the Earth and the interval between the Earth and the Sun; nothing is more in agreement with a right and fitting and ordered proportioning than that the equality of both ratios should be postulated — so that as many times as the terrestrial body E is contained in the solar body S, so many times also is the semidiameter of the Earth E contained in SE, the interval between the centres of the sun and the Earth; so that in this way, as the terrestrial body E is to the solar body S, so the semidiameter of the Earth E is to SE, the distance between the centres.

How is the magnitude of the semidiameter of the Earth got from these two axioms?

Let the semidiameter of the sun S be put down as 100,000 parts, so that the interval SE between the centres of the sun and the Earth will be 22,918,166 such parts. The cube of 100,000, i.e., 1,000,000,000,000,000 is to be divided by the interval 22,918,166; and the [square] root of the quotient — which is the continued sine 0°15'0" is to be taken, and it will be 6,606. That will be the magnitude [479] of the semidiameter of the Earth. For as 6,606 — the semidiameter of the Earth — is contained 3,469 1/3 times in 22,918,166 — the interval between the Sun and the Earth — so too the cube of 6,606 — the semidiameter of the Earth — is contained the same number of times, i.e., 3,469 1/3 in the cube of 100,000, the semidiameter of the sun. But it is known from geometry that the ratio of cubes to one another is the same as the ratio of the globes inscribed in the same cubes. So the semidiameter of the sun S will contain the semidiameter of the Earth E a little more than fifteen times; but the body of the sun S will contain the body of the Earth E approximately 3,469 times.

You say that its magnitude is approximately three times what the ancients assigned to the longest distance of the sun from the Earth, for they set a lesser distance, only 1200 times the semidiameter of the Earth: and you say twenty times the [former] ratio of bodies, because they made the sun only 166 times greater than the Earth: do not you respect their astronomical observations?

Not at all. For the ancients made the sun as near as a parallax of 3' should have made it to be. Whence Tycho Brahe reasoned that when Mars is nearer to the Earth than the sun is, Mars should be observed to have a parallax much greater than 3'. But I have observed that the parallax of Mars is not at all perceptible to sense. Therefore the distance of Mars, even when most near, is greater than 1200 semidiameters; and the distance of the sun is greater too.

[480] The diameters of Mars and Venus can be observed through the ancient instruments and through the Belgian telescope of modern times; and they are found to be of a very few minutes. Therefore, if the sun is as near as the ancients say it is, then these planets — each in its own ratio — will become as near as Tycho Brahe said, out of Copernicus. If Mars is so near, it will be even smaller in its visible diameter. Therefore Mars will be smaller than the Earth, namely, the higher planet will be smaller than the lower; so that there will be no proportion [analogia] between the magnitude of the bodies and their order — and that is not in agreement with the adornment of the world.

The greater the distance of the sun is set down to be, the smaller the parallax of the sun becomes. And the smaller the parallax of the sun, the greater the parallax of the moon from the sun; if the simple parallax of the moon is taken from its own principles, and that is of great service in correcting the doctrine of eclipses. Therefore such a great magnitude for the interval of the sun is confirmed rather than refuted by astronomical observations.

And it accords with the precept of physics that the solar body, which gives movement to all the other planets, should be much greater than all the mobile bodies fused together into one.

The determination of what body follows most closely upon the determination of the Earth?

Of the moon, a secondary planet: (1) because this star has been assigned to the Earth as its private property, so that the moon might help with the growth of earthly creatures and be observed by the speculative creature on the Earth, and that the observation of the stars might begin with it. (2) Because the reasons for the ratio to be established are practically the same.

Tell the foundations of the ratio between the moon and the Earth, by reason of the body and by reason of the interval.

1.  Again, the visible diameter of the moon at its greatest distance from the Earth had to occupy 1/20 of the circle, both on account of the number itself, as before, and also on account of the eclipses of the sun, a spectacle ordained by the Creator in order that the speculative creature should thereby be taught concerning the rationale of the course of the stars. And teaching would be done most rightly if the semidiameters of the sun and moon were to appear equal at the greatest distance of each: so that in this way the moon could cover the sun exactly, during this relationship of both stars, if it occurred. And so M, the moon and S the sun make the same angle at E the Earth.
2.  Moreover, it was fitting that the ratio between the terrestrial body and the lunar body should be to the ratio between the distance of the moon and the semidiameter of the Earth as in the former case the ratio between the solar body and the terrestrial body was to the ratio between the solar interval and the semidiameter of the Earth: namely, the proportion holding between the pair of ratios should in both cases be the same. For the moon, a secondary and terrestrial planet, made in order to obscure the sun, should have followed the example of the ratios of the sphere of the sun or the Earth.

What follows from this?

Two things follow from postulating the two axioms. And either one of these two things by itself, by a wonderful concord of probabilities, even if it did not follow from the foregoing, [482] could be employed in place of an axiom, since they are very worthy of belief by themselves. The first is as follows: that since the proportion of ratios on the part of the sun is one of equality, i.e., as many times as the body of the Earth E is contained in the greater body of the sun S, so many times is the semidiameter of the Earth E contained in SE the distance or semidiameter of the sphere of the Earth or sun. But that proportion is not more probable than the following: that the body of the Earth E will contain the lunar body M, which is narrower and smaller, as many times as the semidiameter of the Earth E is contained in the distance or semidiameter of the lunar orbit EM; and the former proportion is no more probable than this latter. This very proportion, employed as an axiom, has its own dignity; hence, because the Earth is the home of the measuring creature, therefore the Earth by its own body measures even the smaller lunar body, just as previously it measured the solar body which is greater than it: and by a semidiameter it measures the semidiameter of the lunar sphere. But both proportions are in the ratio of equality, because M the lunar sphere is alone placed around E the Earth, just as the Earth’s sphere is placed around the Sun; and so the measurement of the lunar sphere and the lunar body, prior to the other planetary bodies, is no less proper to the Earth than previously the measuring of the solar body and the solar sphere was. But in its own proper measuring, it is right for the ratio of equality to hold, as first and principal, if nothing prevents it.

The second thing which follows from the premises by a long circle of demonstration — see it in my *Hipparchus* — is as follows: that by this reasoning the semidiameter of the moon’s orbit or the distance EM is a mean proportional between the distance ES, or semidiameter of the Earth’s sphere, and the semidiameter of the terrestrial body: so that as the semidiameter of the Earth E is to EM the semidiameter of the moon’s sphere, so EM is to ES the semidiameter of the Earth’s sphere or the sun’s. Here again there is an equality of both ratios which is itself probable, because what the Earth’s sphere placed around the sun is to the sun is what the moon’s sphere placed around the Earth is to the moon.

[483] Do observations agree with this interval between the moon and the Earth?

Down to the last hair: for Brahe found that in its quadratures the distance of the perigeal moon from the Earth was slightly less than 54 semidiameters of the Earth; but the distance of the apogeal moon in the same quadratures is more than 59, slightly less than 60. And from these beginnings it is inferred that the first distance is 54, the second 59.

How is the magnitude of the semidiameter of the moon to be inferred from the axioms and conclusions employed as axioms, which have been posited?

1.  If the semidiameter of the moon M is set down as 100,000 parts, so that the interval EM between the centres of the moon and the Earth is 22,918,166 such parts: the cube of 100,000, i.e., 1,000,000,000,000,000, is to be multiplied by 22,918,166; and the fourth root of the product is to be taken: the fourth root will be 389,085, showing the magnitude of the semidiameter of the Earth in terms of the same parts. For just as 389,085 the semidiameter of the Earth is contained in 22,918,166, the distance to the moon, a little less than 59 times, so too the cube of 389,085 will contain the cube of 100,000 slightly less than 59 times, and so the globe of the Earth will contain the globe of the moon slightly less than 59 times. Thus the semidiameter of the terrestrial body E will contain the semidiameter of the lunar body M less than four times.
2.  Differently and more simply, from a later conclusion: the square root of 3,469 1/3, viz., of the distance to the sun, is taken, and it is slightly less than 59; and EM the distance of the moon is 59 whereof the semidiameter of the Earth is 1. But if 1, the semidiameter of the Earth is divided by 59, and the cube root of the quotient is taken, the result will be the semidiameter of the lunar body in terms of the same dimensions.

Then what is the ratio of the diameters of the sun and moon inferred to be?

The same as the ratio of the solar sphere to the lunar sphere, or that of the [484] lunar [sphere] to the terrestrial body, viz., the ratio holding between slightly less than 59 to 1. And so the solar body contains the lunar body more than 200,000 times.

What are the ratios of the planetary globes to one another?

Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitudes should be the same as the order of spheres, so that among the six primary planets, Mercury should have the least body, because it is inmost, and should obtain the most narrow sphere; that next to Mercury should be Venus, which is larger, but still smaller than the Earth, because moving around in a sphere narrower than the Earth’s but nevertheless wider than Mercury’s; that the larger globe of Mars should be next to the Earth, because its sphere is outside and more spacious, but the lowest of the higher spheres; then the larger globe of Jupiter, in the middle among the higher planets; and finally Saturn’s globe, the largest of the moving bodies, because it is the highest.

Now since bodies have three dimensions, along the diameters, across the surfaces, or in the space contained by the surfaces — or the corporeality — the ratio of the surfaces is the ratio of the squares of the diameters, and the ratio of the bodies is the ratio of the cubes of the diameters; it is consonant that one of the three ratios of the globes should have been made equal to the ratio of the intervals. For example, since Saturn is approximately 10 times farther away from the sun than the Earth, either the diameter of Saturn will be 10 times the diameter of the Earth, the surface 100 times the surface of the Earth and the body 1,000 times the body of the Earth: or the surface of Saturn will be 10 times the surface of the Earth, so that the ratio of the bodies will become the ratio of the 2/3 power of the intervals, and thus Saturn will be 30 times larger than the Earth, just as it is 30 times slower; while the ratio of the diameters will be merely the ratio of the square roots of the intervals, viz., Saturn’s diameter will be a little more than thrice the Earth’s: or the bodies themselves have the ratio of the intervals, so that Saturn will be only ten times greater than the Earth, just as it is ten times farther away [from the sun], while in the surfaces the ratio of the 2/3 power of the intervals will be kept, and in the diameters the ratio of the cube roots of the intervals. And so the diameter of Saturn's body will be slightly greater than twice the diameter of the terrestrial body.

Of these three modes, the first is refuted beyond controversy both by the archetypal reasons and also by the observations of the diameters made with the help of the Belgian telescope; up to now I have approved of the second mode, and Remus Quietanus of the third. On my side the better reasons, the archetypal, seemed to stand; on Remus’ side the observations stand; but in such a delicate question I was afraid that the observations were not certain enough not to be taken exception to.

Nevertheless I yield the place to Remus and his observations. For Jupiter, opposite the sun and in the perigee of its eccentric circle, was frequently seen by me to occupy approximately 50"; Remus observes Saturn to occupy 30"; Mars, opposite the sun and its perigee in Aquarius, appears greater than Jupiter, but not much greater. As a matter of fact, if a body equal to the Earth were seen at as great an interval as we assign to the sun, viz., 3,469 semidiameters of the earth, it would appear to have a diameter of 2'. But now at the perigeal distance of Mars, the same body which is equal to the Earth will be perceived to occupy more than 5' and thus to be equal to six Jupiters. Therefore, the greater the diameter of the globe of Mars is than the diameter of the Earth, the larger will it be in appearance. Therefore, we ought not to make this diameter of the globe of Mars more than one-sixth greater than the diameter of the Earth, as takes place in the third mode.

But this argument will make war perhaps not unsuccessfully with the help of the archetypal reasons: for just as previously we made the ratio of the bodies of the sun and Earth, and of the Earth and moon, the same as the ratio between the semidiameter of the Earth and the semidiameters of the spheres, so now the ratio of the planetary bodies is set down the same as the ratio between the semidiameters of the spheres. So Saturn in its bodily bulk will be slightly less than ten times greater than the Earth; Jupiter will be more than five times; Mars, one and one-half times; but Venus slightly less than three-quarters of the terrestrial body; and Mercury slightly greater than one-third of the same.

[486] Just as the body of the Earth, so should not all the planetary bodies be attuned to the solar body by the same laws as the Earth?

By no means. For if we were to follow this, the planetary bodies would be great in an order contrary to the order of the spheres, viz., Mercury would be greatest; and Saturn smallest with a diameter less than one-third the diameter of the Earth. That, however, is repugnant both to the aforesaid reasons and to observations of their diameters. For Saturn opposite the sun, when it is nine times farther away from the sun than the Earth, occupies approximately 30"; therefore if it were near to the sun, it would occupy 43', since the Earth at an interval of that size would occupy 2'. And so the diameter of Saturn is more than twice as great as the diameter of the Earth.

And this is to say, as I said at the very beginning of this section, that it is very clear from the things themselves that the beginning of setting up the ratios must be made at the Earth. For observations of the moon and the eclipses bear witness to the equality of the two ratios, one of which is between the lunar body and the terrestrial body, and the other between the semidiameter of the Earth and the lunar sphere: we can by no means resist the certitude of the observations. Now it was very probable that the Earth too should be attuned to the sun by the same laws: and when we had set down that, we already had observations agreeing with it distantly: because the observations do not bear out the sun's having a nearness of 1,200 semidiameters of the Earth, but require twice or thrice that distance; and this attunement absolutely demands thrice that distance. Therefore the Earth is certainly the measure both of the solar and lunar bodies and of the solar and lunar spheres. But thus the body of Saturn or any other planetary body can by no means become the measure of both things: once more we bring forward as witnesses of this the certain observations of the diameters. Therefore the Earth alone is the real measure; but the nature of dimensions demands that the beginning of the conformation be taken from the measure.

What should we hold concerning the rarity and density of these six globes?

First, it is not consonant that all the planets should have the same density of matter. For where any multitude of bodies is necessary, there too a variety of conditions is required in order to make distinction, in order that they may be truly many. But the principal condition of bodies as bodies is the internal disposition of the parts. For inequality of bulks somehow happens to the bodies themselves on account of the surfaces bounding the bulks, and the internal part of one body does not differ from the part of another body in this circumscription of bulk. But the principal argument for the dissimilarity of matter is drawn from the consideration of the periodic times: for that consideration will not advance, if we make the globes have the same density, as we shall hear below.

Second, it is consonant that whatever body is nearer to the sun is also denser. For the sun itself is the most dense of all bodies in the world, and its immense and manifold force, which could not exist without a proportionate subject, bears witness to this thing: and the very places which are near the centre wear a certain form [gerunt ideam] of narrowness, such as exists in the condensation of much matter into a narrow place.

Third, nevertheless rarity should not be measured out in proportion to the greatness of the bodies, and density in proportion to the smallness. For example, by the above, both the distance and the amplitude of the globe of Saturn are to the distance and amplitude of the globe of Jupiter as 10 is to 5, approximately. I say that the density of matter of the globe of Saturn must not be put in the same ratio to the density of the globe of Jupiter as the ratio between 5 and 10.

For, if anyone followed this, he would sin against another law of variety by introducing not an unequal amount [copiam] of matter but the same amount throughout all the planets. For when 10 the bulk [488] of Saturn has been multiplied by 5 the density, the product will be 60 the amount of matter, which is as great as the product obtained by multiplying 5 the bulk of Jupiter by 1 its density. But it seems to be preferable and more elegant that the bulks of globes of different density should not be equal to one another, and that the density of globes of unequal bulks should not be the same, and that the amount of matter should not be distributed in equal portions throughout all the globes, which differ in bulk and in the density of their matter. Rather, all these things should vary, so that in whatever order the moving globes succeed one another after the centre, in the same order — order, I say, not ratio — let us measure out not only the spaces between the bodies and the rarity of the bodies but also the amount of matter: thus if Saturn has 50 as its amount of matter, Jupiter should be left with less than 50 but more than 25 the half of that — say 36. For thus the bodies will be as 50 is to 25, the amount of matter as 50 is to 36, the rarity as 50 is to 36, or as 36 is to 25, or the contrary density as 25 is to 36 or as 36 is to 50.

Furthermore, although formerly I upheld the equality of the amount of matter, I have been compelled to assign the ratio of the periodic times to the greatness of the bodies; so that just as Saturn has 30 years and Jupiter 12 years, so too the amplitude of the globe of Saturn to the globe of Jupiter is as 30 is to 12. But the observations of the diameters, made by myself and by Remus, refute this ratio as being too great.

Fourthly, the following things persuade us that the ratio of the amount of matter should be set down as precisely the ratio of the square roots of the bulks or amplitudes — and thus the ratio of the 2/3rd powers of the diameters of the globes and the ratio of the 2/3rd powers of the surfaces. For first, it happens that the ratio of the amount of matter and the ratio of the density are both the ratio of the square roots of the intervals from the sun, and that thus the amount of matter and the density participate equally but inversely in that ratio: hence the amount of matter is greater, hence the density of the same great body is less: and that is the best mean [mediatio] of all. For example, Saturn will be twice as high as Jupiter, one and one-half times as heavy, and one and one-half times rarer, or Jupiter is one and one-half times denser. And in comparing the ratios of one planet: Saturn will be twice as high as heavy and twice as ample as rare.

Moreover, this same ratio of the square roots of the intervals is established by the following geometrical propriety: as above, between the intervals of two planets from the sun — for example, let the intervals be 1 and 64 for the sake of easier reckoning — let there be set down two mean proportionals 4 and 16, that is to say, in order to form the two remaining dimensions of the bodies, so that the bodies of the mobile globes would be to one another as 1 is to 64; but the surfaces of the globes as 1 is to 16 or as 4 is to 64, and finally their diameters as 1 is to 4 or as 4 is to 16 or as 16 is to 64. So now between 1 and 64 the intervals of the same two planets from the sun, let there be set down one mean proportional 8; that is to say: in order to form physically the matter within the bodies, for the matter is one thing only; so again let the intervals between the globes be as 1 is to 64, but let the amount of matter and the rarity too be in a lesser ratio, as 1 is to 8 or as 8 is to 64; or inversely the density, as 8 is to 1, or as 64 is to 8. For in this proportion it makes no difference in what manner it is that the corporeality is condensed or rarefied, whether it is merely in length or also in breadth, or finally in all three dimensions. For the ratio introduced prescribes an amount of the thing to be condensed; and different modes of condensation may be found, with the amount always remaining the same.

Therefore if by means of these principles we compute the densities of the planetary bodies and always seek a mean proportional between two planetary intervals from the sun, or, more precisely, between the diameters of two spheres or orbits, and if we finally compare all the numbers to some common round number and reduce them to round numbers: the result will be the numbers which follow in the table; and I have found that the terrestrial matters which I have placed next to them agree fairly closely with them in their ratio — as you can see in my book which I wrote in the year 1616 in the German language concerning weights and measures:

[490]
Saturn 324 The hardest precious stones
Jupiter 438 The loadstone
Mars 810 Iron
Earth 1000 Silver
Venus 1175 Lead
Mercury 1605 Quicksilver

So that we may reserve gold — whose density in this proportion is 1,800 or 1,900 — for the sun.

Finally what do you set down as the ratio of greatness holding between those three principal regions of the world, between the space wherein is the sun, the space or region of the mobile bodies, and the space of the whole world or the region bounded by the sphere of the fixed stars?

Even if the reasons of Copernicus do not extend to determining by observation the altitude of the sphere of the fixed stars: so that the altitude seems to be like infinity: for in comparison with this distance the total interval between the sun and the Earth, which by the judgement of the ancients embraces 1,200, and by our reasons 3,469, semidiameters of the globe of the Earth, is imperceptible: nevertheless reason, making a stand upon the traces found, discloses a footpath for arriving even at this ratio.

But in the beginning we must glance at the example of the terrestrial and the solar and the lunar spheres, because the ratios of the whole world are derived from the Earth's own proper ratios. And the region described by these three bodies and their courses is as it were a small world. For what the sun is in the Copernican region of the fixed stars — that is, what the Earth is in the sphere or region of the sun — in appearance, at any rate, and for Tycho also is the truth of the thing. And just as the sun is at the centre of the sphere of the fixed stars, unmoving in an unmoving home; so too with respect to the movement of the moon, the Earth is motionless at the centre of the, so to speak, motionless sphere of the sun. For just as the region of the moving bodies is arranged around the sun, so also the sphere of the moon is drawn around the Earth: in the former case the sphere of the fixed stars is the boundary for the planets; here the sun itself is the boundary for the moon, and she returns to this boundary at the end of a month when all her phases are completed.

Therefore it is consonant that, just as by necessary reasons the sphere of the moon was made a mean proportional between the apparent sphere of the sun and the terrestrial body at its centre; so too the region of the moving bodies, or the outmost circle of Saturn, becomes a mean proportional between the outmost sphere of the fixed stars and the solar body at the centre of the world.

Again the same thing is accomplished, even without reference to the small world, by the consideration of the great world itself. For since in one respect the movable bodies strive after the immobility of the encircling body, which supplies the place, while they struggle against the movement, so that they are not moved with such great speed as the mover strives after; in another respect they receive movement from the mover to a certain degree, so that movement

movement from the mover and rest from the body supplying the place are somehow mixed together in the movable bodies. Therefore if it is permissible to state a physical thing in mathematical words, the movable bodies can very aptly be called a mean proportional between the body which is the source of movement, and the immovable body which supplies the place.

But since this thing is true (*verum*) physically and spatially—for the source is inside, the thing supplying the place is outside, and the movable bodies are in the middle—therefore nothing is more probable (*verisimilius*) than that even geometrically the semidiameter of the region of the movable bodies should be the mean proportional between the semidiameter of the solar body and the semidiameter of the sphere of the fixed stars, so that just as the solar globe is to the spherical system of all the planets, so this system is to the spherical body of the whole world, which is bounded by the region of the fixed stars. See the diagram on page 854.

**How do we know the ratio of the diameter of the solar body to the diameter of the region of the movable bodies?**

With the aid of mathematical instruments, from the angle which the solar body occupies in our vision. For since [492] this angle is approximately, it follows that the sun has a distance of 229 of its semidiameters from our vision. But our point of vision is on the Earth; and the diameter of the sphere of the Earth, placed around the sun, is slightly greater than of the diameter of the sphere of Saturn. Therefore the outermost sphere of the movable bodies, i.e., Saturn’s, contains approximately ten times as many diameters of the sun [as the terrestrial sphere does], i.e., about 2,000. In the diagram on page 854 this [outermost sphere of Saturn] is the middle circle.

**How great does the sphere of the fixed stars turn out to be by this reasoning?**

As the diameter of Saturn’s sphere, the outermost sphere of the movable bodies, contains the diameter of the solar body about 2,000 times, so too the diameter of the sphere of the fixed stars would contain the diameter of Saturn’s sphere about 2,000 times. And so the diameter of the sphere of the fixed stars will contain about 4,000,000 diameters of the solar body, and—according to the ratio between the solar and terrestrial bodies believed by the ancients—more than five times as many diameters of the Earth, i.e., 20,000,000; and by our reasoning, three times that, i.e., 60,000,000.

**But is not this amplitude of the sphere of the fixed stars unbelievable, for you make it to be 2,000 times greater than the sphere of Saturn, although among the ancients this sphere stood just above Saturn?**

But much more unbelievable is the rapidity—for the ancients—of the spheres of the fixed stars and Saturn. And since it is necessary for one of these two opinions to stand, it is more probable that the sphere of the fixed stars should be 2,000 or 1,000 times wider than the ancients said than that it should be 24,000 times faster than Copernicus said. For in the former case there is no movement present in a subject which is very spacious and as it were infinite; but in the

KEPLER
884

latter case an as it were infinite movement is placed in the small sphere of Saturn. In itself such a great amplitude is not repugnant to Brahe's observations, nor is it discordant with reason that bodies which are at rest should be distant from the movable bodies by such an immense interval.

[493] **How do you know that such a great amplitude is not repugnant to Brahe's observations?**

He observed the greatest altitude of the pole star—which at that time was at 7° of the Ram—in the year 1586 at the midnight after the autumn equinox; and it was 58°51'. He observed the greatest altitude [of the same star] on the winter solstice on December 26 at about the sixth hour of the evening, and he found it again at 58°51'. And so there was no difference; even though during the month of September the horizon cut the sphere of the fixed stars lower down—by approximately the whole semidiameter of the sphere in which the Earth is borne—than on December 26, because on the first date the sun was apparent in the Libra; and on the second date, in the Capricornus. The same thing occurred when the least altitude was observed on the midnight after the spring equinox and after the winter solstice at 6 o'clock in the morning; for in both cases the altitude was found to be 52°59', although during the month of March the horizon cut the sphere of the fixed stars higher up—by approximately the whole semidiameter of the sphere wherein the Earth is borne—than in December. Therefore the diameter of the sphere wherein the Earth is borne is not perceptible through Brahe’s instruments.

And so since the diameter [of the terrestrial sphere] does not make a difference of 1' in the sphere of the fixed stars, therefore it is not 1/3600th part of the semidiameter of the sphere of the fixed stars. Therefore the semidiameter of Saturn’s sphere—which is approximately 10 times the semidiameter of the terrestrial sphere—is not equal to 1/3600th part or 1/3400th part of the semidiameter of the sphere of the fixed stars. But it is much less possible to decide whether therefore it is 1/1000th part, i.e., where the aforesaid altitudes of the polar star differ by 3/4' or 12", and we cannot believe in the diligence of observers to the extent of 3/4'.

According to Brahe, Saturn has a distance of 12,300 semidiameters of the Earth from the centre of the Earth. Therefore its diurnal circle, when it is on the equator, contains 77,314 semidiameters of the Earth, i.e., 66,420,000 German miles; and their division into 24 hours makes the portion of one hour to be 2,767,500; and the sum of 240 miles—for according to Copernicus that was the space traversed by Saturn in one hour—is 1/12,500th part of that.

But according to Ptolemy, by Copernicus' corrections, the ratio of the spheres would be as follows:

- The moon is 64 1/2 semidiameters distant from the Earth.
- 505 1/2 for the body of the moon and Mercury’s
- Mercury:

25,742. This is twice as wide as [495] what Brahe has; and the 240 miles, the hourly movement of Saturn in Copernicus, is smaller than 1/24,000th part of Saturn's hourly movement in Ptolemy.

**What do you think are the ratios of density of the solar body, the ether which permeates the whole universe, and the sphere of the fixed stars which encloses all things from the outside?**

Since these three bodies are analogous to the centre, the surface of the sphere and the interval, three symbols of the three persons of the Holy Trinity; it is believable that there is only as much matter in one as there is in either one of the two remaining: in such fashion that a third part of the matter of the whole universe should be packed together into the body of the sun, although in comparison with the amplitude of the world the body of the sun is very narrow; that likewise a third part of the matter should be spread out thinly throughout the immense expanse of the world; that the sun should in this fashion possess within its own body as much matter as outside of itself the sun is fated to illuminate with the mighty power of light and to penetrate with its rays; and that finally, a third part of the matter should have been rolled out in the form of a spherical surface and thrown around the world on the outside as a wall. And in order that we may shadow forth the proportion to some extent of a known thing which is similar, even if we cannot equal the proportion, let us imagine that the solar body is all gold, the sphere of the fixed stars of water, or glass, or crystal, and the inside space full of air. Whence we are able to understand to a certain extent what divine Moses signified by the Firmament—*raquia*, which properly means expansion, viz., the blowing in of the ether—and what by the supercelestial waters. For similarly boys have a game which is an image of creation, when they make bubbles out of soap and water by blowing air into them. The difference is that God holds up the drop—so to speak—of water on the inside [496] at the centre. In the case of the boys, the drop of water, on account of its weight, does not remain at the centre, and is not separated from the surface by the blowing but sticks at the bottom of the bubble.

**How great do you set down the thickness to be, or the distance between the inner and the outer surface of the sphere of the fixed stars?**

Since we have given it as much matter as is in the total expanse of the world which it embraces; with the exception of the matter which is in the very narrow globe of the sun, but since by no means must the matter of the sphere of the fixed stars be set down as having the same density as the matter in the region of the mobile bodies but a density which is a mean proportional between the density of the ether and the density of matter in the solar body; therefore the sphere of the fixed stars should have an extension which is a mean proportional between the extension [497] of the solar body and the extension of the celestial ether. But, as above, the ratio of the diameter of the sun to the diameter of the ether was as 1 is to 4,000,000. Therefore the ratio of the extensions is the ratio of the cubes, i.e., 1 to 64,000,000,000,000,000,000. But the mean proportional between these numbers is 8,000,000,000. Therefore, that number of spaces equal to the body of the sun will be equal to the space between the concave and convex surfaces of the sphere of the fixed stars. And so the whole world, when its three members have been added together, is represented by the number 64,000,008,000,000,001. And its cube root, 4,000,000, shows that this sphere, having a thickness of 1/3000th part of the semidiameter of the solar body and thrown up around the celestial ether, embraces in its body 8,000,000,000 spaces equal to the solar body. Therefore this skin, or tunic of the world, or crystalline supercelestial sphere, is of such great subtlety, on account of the amplitude of its expansion, that if you made it coagulate into one spherical mass, it would have a semidiameter 2,000 times greater than the semidiameter of the solar body, since at present it is not more thick than 1/3000th of the semidiameter of the solar body, or a little more than 2,000 German miles.

**How great will the sun appear to be if you imagine an eye placed on one of the fixed stars?**

The 4,000,000th part of the semidiameter of the [sphere of the] fixed stars subtends about 1/3600th of a degree. Therefore the solar body appears to have a diameter of 1/3600th of a degree; it measures the great circle 1,296,000 times; or the apparent diameter of the sun from among the fixed stars is 1/1,296,000th part of its apparent diameter viewed from the Earth.

**How great in turn do the fixed stars appear from the Earth?**

Skilled observers deny that any magnitude, as it were, [498] of a round body can be uncovered by looking through a telescope; or rather, if a more perfect instrument is used, the fixed stars can be represented as mere points, from which shining rays, like hairs, go forth and are spread out.

**Does it seem therefore that any one of the fixed stars is such a body as the sun is, and that the sun in turn is seen from the fixed stars to be of such great appearance as any one of the fixed stars?**

I do not think so: for these observations do not prevent the sun from having a body of greater bulk than the fixed stars. Moreover, the view of the sun from such a great interval would be brighter than that of any fixed stars. For if, for example, you pierce through a wall with only a pin, so that the sun can shine

EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY, IV
887

through the hole, a greater brightness is poured through from the beams than all the fixed stars shining together in a cloudless sky would give. And the eye is not injured by any of the fixed stars; but it cannot bear to look towards the sun even from a distance.

## Part II

On the Movement of the Bodies of the World

### 1. How Many and of What Sort Are the Movements?

[499] **What was the opinion of Copernicus concerning the movement of bodies? For him, what was in motion and what was at rest?**

There are two species of local movement: for either the whole thing turns, while remaining in its place, but with its parts succeeding one another. This movement can be called *δίνησις*—lathe-movement, or cone-movement—from the resemblance; or rotation from a rotating pole. Or else the whole thing is borne from place to place circularly. The Greeks call this movement *φορά*, the Latins *circuitus*, or *circumlatio*, or *ambitus*. But they call both movements generally revolution.

Accordingly Copernicus lays down that the sun is situated at the centre of the world and is motionless as a whole, viz., with respect to its centre and axis. Only a few years ago, however, we grasped by sense that the sun turns with respect to the parts of its body, i.e., around its centre and axis—as reasons had led me to assert for a long time—and with such great speed that one rotation is completed in the space of 25 or 26 days.

Now according as each of the primary bodies is nearer the sun, so it is borne around the sun in a shorter period, under the same common circle of the zodiac, and all in the same direction in which the parts of the solar body precede them [500]—Mercury in the space of three months, Venus in seven and one-half months, the Earth with the lunar heaven in twelve months, Mars in twenty-two and one-half months or less than two years, Jupiter in twelve years, Saturn in thirty years. But for Copernicus the sphere of the fixed stars is utterly immobile.

The Earth meanwhile revolves around its own axis too, and the moon around the Earth—still in the same direction (if you look towards the outer parts of the world) as all the primary bodies.

Now for Copernicus all these movements are direct and continuous, and there are absolutely no stations or retrogradations in the truth of the matter.

**By what arguments is it proved that the sphere of the fixed stars does not move?**

It was shown in Book I that the sphere of the fixed stars does not rotate around its centre and axis. For we attribute wholly to the Earth whatever appearance of this meets the eyes. Let the other arguments be sought there, in *folium* 104 *et seqq*. Let us repeat two things alone as proper to this place, one as regards the speed. For if the outermost sphere contains at least 4,000,000 diameters of the sun in its diameter, the circumference will be more than 12,566,370 solar diameters in length. And if all that revolves in 24 hours, then in one hour 523,600 diameters will revolve; in one minute 8,727; in one second—which is approximately equal to the heart-beat of man—145 diameters of the sun, which is not less than 13,000 German miles; and so during the space of time during which the artery once dilates and again contracts, with a twin

KEPLER
888

pulse-beat, around 7,500,000 (German) miles of the greatest circle would be revolved—and Saturn, in an orbit 2,000 times narrower, would still traverse approximately 4,000 miles.

The second argument destroys completely every movement of the sphere of the fixed stars. For it is not apparent for whose good, since nothing is outside of it, it changes its position and appearances by being moved to what place or from what place, and since it obtains by rest [501] whatever it could acquire by any movement. For the movements of all bodies are understood from its rest; and unless it gives them a place, as it can do perfectly by being at rest, nothing can be moved.

**How is the ratio of the periodic times, which you have assigned to the mobile bodies, related to the aforesaid ratio of the spheres wherein those bodies are borne?**

The ratio of the times is not equal to the ratio of the spheres, but greater than it, and in the primary planets exactly the ratio of the 3/2th powers. That is to say, if you take the cube roots of the 30 years of Saturn and the 12 years of Jupiter and square them, the true ratio of the spheres of Saturn and Jupiter will exist in these squares. This is the case even if you compare spheres which are not next to one another. For example, Saturn takes 30 years; the Earth takes one year. The cube root of 30 is approximately 3.11. But the cube root of 1 is 1. The squares of these roots are 9.672 and 1. Therefore the sphere of Saturn is to the sphere of the Earth as 9,672 is to 1,000. And a more accurate number will be produced, if you take the times more accurately.

**What is gathered from this?**

Not all the planets are borne with the same speed, as Aristotle wished, otherwise their times would be as their spheres, and as their diameters; but according as each planet is higher and farther away from the sun, so it traverses less space in one hour by its mean movement: Saturn—according to the magnitude of the solar sphere believed in by the ancients—traverses 240 German miles (in one hour), Jupiter 320 German miles. Mars 600, the centre of the Earth 740, Venus 800, and Mercury 1,200. And if this is to be according to the solar interval proved by me in the above, the number of miles must everywhere be tripled.

### 2. Concerning the Causes of the Movement of the Planets

[502] **State the opinion of the ancient astronomers as to how the planets move.**

The ancients, Eudoxus and Callippus, and their follower Ptolemy did not advance beyond circles, wherewith they were accustomed to demonstrate the phenomena—not worrying as to how the planets completed these circles: for in Book XIII of the *Almagest*, Chapter 2, Ptolemy writes as follows:

> “But let no one judge that these interweavings of circles which we postulate are difficult, on the ground that he sees that for men the manual imitation of these interweavings is quite intricate. For it is not right for our human things to be compared on a basis of equality with the immortal gods, and for us to seek the evidence for very lofty things from examples of very unlike things.
>
> “For is anything more unlike anything than those things which are always in the same state are unlike those things which never stay like themselves, and than those things which can everywhere be impeded by all things are unlike those things which [889] can be impeded not even by themselves? Indeed we must try hard to fit the most simple hypotheses to the celestial movements, insofar as that is possible; but if that is not successful, whatever sort of hypotheses can be used. For if only all things which appear in the heavens are given as a consequence of these hypotheses, then there is no reason for being surprised that interweavings of this sort can occur in the movements of the celestial bodies. For these [interwoven circles] do not have a nature which may impede their movement, but only a nature which has grown fitted to give way and to offer a place for the natural motions of each planet, even if the motions happen to be contrary to one another: so much so that all the circles, speaking absolutely, can interpenetrate all circles with no more difficulty than the movements can be perceived. And these movements occur with ease not only around the single circles, but also around the whole spheres, and around the axes of curved and closed surfaces. For even if the various interweavings of circles, on account of the different movements, and the engrafting of one circle in another are very difficult in the customary representations which are constructed by the human hand, and do not succeed so easily that the movements themselves are not at all impeded: nevertheless we see in the heavens that such a manifold concourse of movements by no means stands in the way of the single movements taking place. Indeed, we should not judge what is simple in celestial bodies by the examples of things which seem to us to be simple, since not even here does the same thing seem to be equally simple in all lands. For it will easily happen that he who wishes to judge celestial things in this way will not recognize as simple any of those movements which take place in the heavens, not even the invariable constancy of the first movement: because it is not only difficult but utterly impossible to find among men this thing (namely, something which stays in the same state perpetually). Therefore we must not form our judgement upon terrestrial things, but upon the natures of the things which are in the heavens and upon the unchanging steadfastness of their movements. So it comes about that in this way all the movements are seen to be simple, and much more simple than those movements which seem to us to be simple. For we are unable to suspect them of any labor or any difficulty in their revolutions.” ^ So Ptolemy.

[^1]: I have, for obvious reasons, translated Kepler's Latin rather than Ptolemy's Greek. C. G. Wallis.

**What do you find lacking in this opinion of Ptolemy's?**

Even if it is true for many reasons that we should not judge of the ease of celestial movements from the difficulty of the movements of the elements, nevertheless it does not follow that with respect to the celestial movements no terrestrial cases are akin; and Ptolemy seems to draw out this excuse to such lengths that he undermines the whole possibility (*universalem rationem*) of astronomy; and so the excuse satisfies neither the astronomers nor the philosophers, and cannot be tolerated in a Christian discipline.

For as regards astronomy, he brings all hypotheses under suspicion of falsity so long as he argues so strongly for the diversity of celestial and terrestrial things, so that even reason is put down as erring in its judgment [504] of what is geometrically simple. For if that which to our reasoning concerning the heavens seems to be composite, because our reason compounds circles, is simple in the heavens themselves, therefore in the heavens circles are not compounded with one another in order to fashion one movement. Therefore the astronomer is making a false supposition, and, as is extremely astonishing, is eliciting the truth from things which are absolutely false. But that is to destroy the honor of astronomy, which Aristotle upholds in his books of *Metaphysics*, believing that “the astronomers should be listened to on the form, lay-out, and movements of the celestial bodies.” But in truth Ptolemy reveals himself as regards what he desires: for he says to construct hypotheses which are as simple as possible, if that can be done. And so if anyone constructs simpler hypotheses than he—understanding simplicity geometrically—he on the contrary will not defend his composite hypotheses by this excuse but will say to prefer the hypotheses which seem simpler to us men of the Earth, even if we employ terrestrial examples.

As regards philosophy: the philosophers will deny that it is sufficient that the matter of the celestial body should be liquid and permeable by the globes and so should not resist the motions of the globes through it. For they ask what this thing is which leads the globe around, especially if it is established that the matter of the globes resists the movers. They ask by what force the mover moves the body from place to place, as there is no immobile field remaining underneath, and since a round body does not possess the services of feet or wings, by the motion of which animals transport their bodies through the ether, or birds through the air by pressing upon and springing up from the air-current. They ask by what light of the mind, by what means the mover perceives or forms the centres of the circles and the encircling orbits. Finally, neither theology nor the nature of things can bear that Ptolemy, who is steeped in pagan superstition, should make the stars to be visible gods—namely, by inferring immortal life from their eternal motion—and should attribute more to them than belongs to God Himself the Founder—that is to say, that geometrical reasons which are really composite, and the understanding whereof [505] God wished man His image to have in common with Him, should be simple in the stars.

**State Aristotle's opinion as to how the planets move in a circle.**

Aristotle, believing that the heavens were joined together by solid spheres—though of an equivocal matter—and the later philosophers, whom the Arabs seem to have followed, and after them Peurbach the writer on the schemata—they, I say, at first believed astronomy as regards the number of circles necessary in order to demonstrate the appearances: so Aristotle believed Eudoxus and Callippus concerning the twenty-five spheres. He attributed to the spheres the same number of motor intelligences, who were to revolve in their mind the time of the period and the region of the world into which the motion was to proceed. But since it was probable that all the spheres should look to the same beginning, Aristotle judged that twenty-four other spheres should be placed between these twenty-five spheres, and he called them *ἀνελίττουσαι*, or counter-turners: namely, in order that each lower sphere should be freed by the interposition of the counter-turner from the carrying off which it was going to suffer from the higher sphere on account of the contiguity of the surfaces. The counter-turners move in an equal time and in a direction opposite to that of the higher sphere, and by that resistance give an appearance of rest, wherein as in an immobile place the lower sphere is stayed and completes its own proper period. And so the mover of each sphere was appointed to give to his own sphere

and to all the lower spheres which it embraced a most regular movement within the higher sphere which was placed in contiguity to this sphere. But since that philosopher had decided that movement was eternal, he appointed movers

EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY, IV

which were also eternal and immaterial, because material things could not have an infinite power. Therefore it followed that the movers were separate and immobile beginnings. But since this eternal duration of the celestial essence seemed to him to be the goodness and perfection of the whole world, as being opposed to destruction, which was something evil; he also gave to these beginnings the highest perfection and the understanding of this perfection, and from understanding the good the will to pursue it, lest [the intelligence] should not do well that which is good; in this way he introduced to us separate minds and finally gods, as the administrators of the everlasting movement of the heavens—just as Ptolemy did. As a matter of fact, Scaliger, who professed Christianity, and other followers of Aristotle dispute as to whether this movement of the spheres is voluntary and as to whether the beginning of will in the movers is understanding and desire. And indeed, if the world were eternal as Aristotle contended, at any rate the fixed region in which the planet revolves would bear witness concerning the understanding. For we Christians cannot deny that the highest wisdom has presided over the instituting of the movements whereby the planet is made to run into its own region and is dispatched into its own spaces as if from the barriers; but Aristotle assigned this office to the movers themselves, as being eternal.

Furthermore, motor souls were added, tightly bound to the spheres and informing them, in order that they might assist the intelligences somewhat; or because it seemed necessary for the first mover and the movable to unite in some third thing; or because the power of movement was finite with respect to the space to be traversed and the movement was not of an infinite speed but was described in a time measured out according to space; and that argued that the ratio of the motor power to the movable body and to the spaces was fixed and measured.

And so by this solidity of the spheres and by the constant strength of the motor power absolutely all the movements or celestial appearances were so taken care of, that—given the beginning of movement—then indeed every variation in the movements would arise from the lay-out and plurality of the spheres without any labour or worry on the part of the intelligence; and the spheres moved around poles which were at rest—in approximately the way in which in *Book I* the terrestrial body was said to rotate around its axis and its poles. And by that movement every sphere—and certain people make them wholly of adamant, so that they by no means yield to any body—carried around its planet, which was bound to the sphere at a fixed place; and one sphere supported another as was said above: and there was no fear that the globes or spheres would fall, bound to one another in this way.

How do you feel about this 'philosophy'?

Again, I do not raise as an objection to it so much the authority of the Christian discipline as the absurdity of the teaching which fashions gods whose functions are among the works of nature and which meanwhile ascribes to them from eternity such things as are necessarily started by one first beginning of all things at the commencement of time. And since this reasoning cannot do without its theology, the whole thing is overthrown by the denial of gods.

Further, solid spheres cannot be granted, as was proved above. But once more, this philosophy rests upon solid spheres, and it is overthrown by undermining them. For Aristotle will readily grant that a body cannot be transported by its soul from place to place, if the sphere lacks the organ which reaches out through the whole circuit to be traversed, and if there is no immobile body upon which the sphere may rest.

Moreover, even if we grant solid spheres, nevertheless there are vast intervals between the spheres. Either these intervals will be filled by useless spheres which contribute nothing to the state of movement; or else, if there are not solid spheres throughout these intervals, then the spheres will not touch one another or carry one another.

Finally this theory abandons itself, in seeing to it that one sphere rests upon another, but forgetting the lowest sphere. For if we are to grant that spheres are supported by spheres and that they are contiguous to one another, then what supports the lowest sphere of the moon or by what columns is it supported upon the Earth, which, as they suppose, is at rest? Since nowhere on the surface of the Earth is any solidity met with: the winds, clouds, and birds freely and easily come and go everywhere. Why doesn’t the great weight of the heavens sink down upon us, especially when the denser parts of the spheres approach our zenith? Or if the heavens have no weight, what need do we have of spheres for carrying the planetary globes?

If there are no solid spheres, then there will seem to be all the more need of intelligences in order to regulate the movements of the heavens, although the intelligences are not gods. For they can be angels or some other rational creature, can they not?

There is no need of these intelligences, as will be proved; and it is not possible for the planetary globe to be carried around by an intelligence alone. For in the first place, mind is destitute of the animal power sufficient to cause movement, and it does not possess any motor force in its *assent* alone, and it cannot be heard or perceived by the irrational globe; and even if mind were perceived, the material globe would have no faculty of obeying or of moving itself. But before this, it has already been said that no animal force is sufficient for transporting the body from place to place, unless there are organs and some body which is at rest and on which the movement can take place. Therefore the question falls back to the above.

But on the contrary, the natural powers which are implanted in the planetary bodies can enable the planet to be transported from place to place.

But let it be posited as sufficient for movement that the intelligence should will movement into this or that region: then the discovery of the figure whereon the line of movement is ordered will be irrational. For we are convinced by the astronomical observations which have been taken correctly that the route of a planet is approximately circular and as a matter of fact eccentric—that is, the centre [of the circle] is not at the centre of the world or of some body; and furthermore that during the succession of ages the planet crosses from place to place. Now as many arguments can be drawn up against the discovery of such an orbit as there are parts of it already described.

For first, the orbit of the planet is not a perfect circle. But if mind caused the orbit, it would lay out the orbit in a perfect circle, which has beauty and perfection to the mind. On the contrary, the elliptic figure of the route of the planet and the laws of the movements whereby such a figure is caused

EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY, IV

smell of the nature of the balance or of material necessity rather than of the conception and determination of the mind, as will be shown below.

Finally, in order that we may grant that a different idea from that of a circle shines in the mind of the mover, it is asked by what means the mind can apply this or that [idea] to the regions of the world. Now the circle is described around some one fixed centre, but the ellipse, which is the figure of the planetary orbits, is described around two centres.

Then what seat will you give to mind, so that it may measure out a circle or an elliptic orbit on the liquid plains of the ether? You do not place the mind at the centre, do you? For then you are placing it in the ether, which is not different from all the remaining space of the world, because the orbit of the planet is eccentric to the solar body. But this is exceedingly absurd, since elsewhere the beginning of individuation of souls is assigned to the matter and to the body, to which the soul is added, and this matter differs in place and time and in many other marks from the remaining matter of the world. Surely no other position belongs to the soul and to the mind than that which comes through its body, which the soul informs. And by what force will mind be moved from place to place in a small circle around the centre of the world, so that it may be at the centres of the planetary orbits in the succession of ages, if the mind is without a body and is no more able to be moved than to be given a position in space? By what means will mind view its position or its distance from the centre of the world?

But let it be granted that the mind has a view from its seat at the centre; then how will it cause the planet, which is very distant, to trace its orbit around this centre? If the mind had the planet tied by a rope, perhaps the planet would fly around, being tied to the centre. Perhaps the mind, looking out from the centre, could perceive—especially if it were endowed with bodily eyes—whether the planet were moving in a circle, if the planet were always viewed making an equal angle; but if it should go outside of its circle, in what way would the mind lead it back, if it did not see the orbit by itself? But how does the mind understand the orbit, which is not stamped on the body as its special property? For here there is no question of the intellectual idea of a circle, wherein there is no distinction of great and small, but of the real route of the planet, which has a fixed magnitude in addition to the idea.

But if you place the motor mind outside of the centre of its orbit, its condition will be worse. For either it will be in the body which is at the centre of the world; and thus all the minds will be in the same body, and the above difficulties with respect to keeping the planet in its orbit and with respect to the discovery of the orbit will remain. Or else the mind will be in the globe of the planet: then in both cases it is asked by what means the mind knows where the centre is, around which the orbit of the planet should be organized; and how great the distance of the mind and its globe from that point is. For Avicenna rightly judged that if the mover of the planet is a mind, it has need of knowledge of the centre and of its distance from the centre. For the circle is defined and perfected by the same things, the centre and the equal curvature around it, viz., the distance of the circumference from the centre; and so, however much you exalt the motor mind, nevertheless the circle is nothing else to God except what has already been said. And this same thing should be understood proportionally concerning the figure of the ellipse.

Why do you say that a celestial body, which is unchanging with respect to its matter, cannot be moved by *assent* alone? For if the celestial bodies are neither heavy nor light, but most suited for circular movement, then do they resist the motor mind?

Even if a celestial globe is not heavy in the way in which a stone on the earth is said to be heavy, and is not light in the way in which among us fire is said to be light; nevertheless by reason of its matter it has a natural *adynamia* or powerlessness of crossing from place to place, and it has a natural inertia or rest whereby it rests in every place where it is placed alone. And hence in order that it may be moved out of its position and its rest, it has need of some power which should be stronger than its matter and its naked body, and which should overcome its natural inertia. For such a faculty is above the capacity of nature and is a sprout of form, or a sign of life.

Whence do you prove that the matter of the celestial bodies resists its movers, and is overcome by them, as in a balance the weights are overcome by the motor faculty?

This is proved in the first place from the periodic times of the rotation of the single globes around their axes, as the terrestrial time of one day and the solar time of approximately twenty-five days. For if there were no inertia in the matter of the celestial globe—and this inertia is as it were a weight in the globe—there would be no need of a *virtue* (*virtute*) in order to move the globe; and if the least virtue for moving the globe were postulated, then there would be no reason why the globe should not revolve in an instant. But the revolutions of the globes take place in a fixed time, which is longer for one planet and shorter for another; hence it is apparent that the inertia of matter is not to the motor virtue in the ratio in which nothing is to something. Therefore the inertia is not nil, and thus there is some resistance of celestial matter.

Secondly, this same thing is proved by the revolution of the globes around the sun—considering them generally. For one mover by one revolution of its own globe moves six globes, as we shall hear below. Wherefore if the globes did not have a natural resistance of a fixed proportion, there would be no reason why they should not follow exactly the whirling movement of their mover; and thus they would revolve with it in one and the same time. Now indeed all the globes go in the same direction as the mover with its whirling movement; nevertheless no globe fully attains the speed of its mover, and one follows another more slowly. Therefore they mingle the inertia of matter with the speed of the mover in a fixed proportion.

The ratio of the periodic times seems to be the work of a mind and not of material necessity.

The most accurately harmonic attunement of the extreme movements—the slowest and the fastest movement in any given planet—is the work of the highest and most adored creator Mind or Wisdom. But if the lengths of the periodic times were the work of a mind, they would have something of beauty, like the rational ratios, duplicate, triplicate, and so on. But the ratios of the periodic times are irrational (*ineffabiles, irrationales vulgo*) and thus partake of infinity, wherein there is no beauty for the mind, as there is no definiteness (*finitio*).

Secondly, these times cannot be the work of a mind—I am not speaking of

EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY, IV

the Creator but of the nature of the mover; because the unequal delays in different parts of the circle add up to the times of one period. But the unequal delays arise from material necessity, as will be said below, and as if by reason of the balance (*ex ratione staterae*).

Therefore by what force do you suspend your material globes and the Earth in especial, so that each remains within the boundaries of its region, though it is destitute of the bonds of the solid spheres?

Since it is certain that there are no solid spheres, it is necessary that we should take refuge in this inertia of matter, whereby any globe, placed in any place on the world beyond the motor virtues, naturally rests in that place, because matter, as such, has no faculty of transporting its body from place to place.

Then what is it which makes the planets move around the sun, each planet within the boundaries of its own region, if there are not any solid spheres, and if the globes themselves cannot be fastened to anything else and made to stick there, and if without solid spheres they cannot be moved from place to place by any soul?

Even if things are very far removed from us and which are without a real exemplification are difficult to explain and give rise to quite uncertain judgments, as Ptolemy truly warns; nevertheless if we follow probability (*verisimilitudinem*) and take care not to postulate anything which is contrary to us, it will of necessity be clear that no mind is to be introduced which should turn the planets by the dictation of reason and so to speak by a nod, and that no soul is to be put in charge of this revolution, in order that it should impress something into the globes by the balanced contest of the forces, as takes place in the revolution around the axis; but that there is only one solar body, which is situated at the centre of the whole universe, and to which this movement of the primary planets around the body of the sun can be ascribed.

## 3. On the Revolution of the Solar Body Around its Axis and Its Effect in the Movement of the Planets

By what reasons are you led to make the sun the moving cause or the source of movement for the planets?

1.  Because it is apparent that in so far as any planet is more distant from the sun than the rest, it moves the more slowly—so that the ratio of the periodic times is the ratio of the 3/2th powers of the distances from the sun. Therefore we reason from this that the sun is the source of movement.
2.  Below we shall hear the same thing come into use in the case of the single planets—so that the closer any one planet approaches the sun during any time, it is borne with an increase of velocity in exactly the ratio of the square.
3.  Nor is the dignity or the fitness of the solar body opposed to this, because it is very beautiful and of a perfect roundness and is very great and is the source of light and heat, whence all life flows out into the vegetables: to such an extent that heat and light can be judged to be as it were certain instruments fitted to the sun for causing movement in the planets.
4.  But in especial, all the estimates of probability are fulfilled by the sun’s rotation in its own space around its immobile axis, in the same direction in which all the planets proceed: and in a shorter period than Mercury, the nearest to the sun and fastest of all the planets.

For as regards the fact that it is disclosed by the telescope in our time and can be seen every day that the solar body is covered with spots, which cross the disk of the sun or its lower hemisphere within 12 or 13 or 14 days, slowly at the beginning and at the end, but rapidly in the middle, which argues that they are stuck to the surface of the sun and turn with it; I proved in my *Commentaries on Mars*, Chapter 34, by reasons drawn from the very movement of the planets, long before it was established by the sun-spots, that this movement necessarily had to take place.

What do you think should be held concerning the solar body and the force whereby it turns around its axis?

It was said in the *First Book* that this body—or any other which revolves around its own axis—was not merely moved in a *gyre* by the Creator's omnipotence at the commencement of things, but it also seems to continue this movement by the reinforcement of a motor soul. For even if, by means of some other rationale there unfolded, the movement could be continued, nevertheless the dailiness and yearliness of this movement, in which the total life of the world consists, is more rightly obtained by the reinforcement of a soul.

Do you have any other arguments besides movement which make it likely that a soul is present in the solar body?

1.  A strong argument is drawn from the matter of the solar body and its illumination, which seems to be a quality in the solar body, sprung from the very mighty informing by a soul—namely, a soul whose matter, it is consonant, as was said above, is the most dense matter among the bodies of the world: therefore it is right to believe that very great forces are present in that soul, which dominates and sets on fire the enduring matter.
2.  Moreover, I think a soul must be postulated rather than an inanimate form, because it is apparent from the rising of sun-spots and their dispersion and from the unequal illumination of different parts in different times that there is not one continuous and perpetually uniform *energy* (*energiam*) in all the parts of the solar body, but that it admits movement and variation and interchanges, and that such things take place in the solar globe as take place in the terrestrial globe, *mutatis mutandis*, so that from its inmost bowels hither and yon things which look like clouds are breathed out—which are perhaps black soot—and when their matter has been consumed, the light of the parts which before were covered by those spots becomes more bright. And since these interchanges are perennial, they smell of the guardianship of a soul rather than a simple form.
3.  Moreover, light in itself (*per se*) is something akin to the soul: no less than this same thing was proven of heat in *Book I*. For on the earth nothing is set on fire (*inflammatur*), that is to say, is made luminous, which was not engendered by some soul in a body: as a trunk from the soul of the shoot, alcohol from the soul growing in the vine, sparks from iron and stones, which are things cooked up in the bowels of the Earth by the soul of the Earth. But that light is something akin to our flames is clear from the fact that light concentrated by concave or convex lenses sets on fire in such fashion that there are flames and coals. And so it is consonant that the solar body, wherein the light is present as in its source, is endowed with a soul which is the originator, the preserver, and the continuator.
4.  And the function of the sun in the world seems to persuade us of nothing else except that just as it has to illuminate all things, so it is possessed of light in its body; and as it has to make all things warm, it is possessed of heat; as it has to make all things live, of a bodily life; and as it has to move all things, it itself is the beginning of the movement; and so it has a soul in itself.

You doubt, do you, further add mind or intelligence to the soul of the sun, in order for it to regulate this movement of the sun around the axis?

There is absolutely no need of mind for the functions of movement. For the region in which the sun revolves exists from the first commencement of things. But the constancy of the revolution and of the periodic time, as was explained above, depends upon the ratio of the constant power of the mover to the obstinacy (*contumaciam*) of the matter. But the directing of the solar axis perpetually towards the same region is stillness rather than the work of mind, since from the first commencement of things none of this movement has been impressed upon the axis. But also the mean circle between the extremes of the axis, the poles, necessarily follows the direction of the axis; and it, regulated by the same perpetually fixed points, abides as the axis abides. Finally, the laying hold of the planetary bodies, which the rotation of the sun makes to revolve, is a bodily virtue, not animal, not mental.

And let these things be said with respect to movement. However, with respect to the inferences concerning intelligence, to which the consideration of the celestial harmonies leads, see the last chapter in *Book V of my Harmonies*.

Then does the sun by the rotation of its body make the planets revolve? And how can this be, since the sun is without hands with which it may lay hold of the planet, which is such a great distance away, and by rotating may make the planet revolve with itself?

Instead of hands there is the virtue of its body, which is emitted in straight lines throughout the whole amplitude of the world, and which—because it is a form of the body—rotates along with the solar body like a very rapid *vortex*; moving through the total amplitude of the circuit—whatever magnitude it reaches to—with equal speed; and the sun revolves in the narrowest space at the centre.

Could you make the thing clearer by some example?

Indeed there comes to our assistance the attraction between the loadstone and the iron pointer, which has been magnetized by the loadstone and which gets magnetic force by rubbing. Turn the loadstone in the neighbourhood of the pointer; the pointer will turn at the same time. Although the laying hold is of a different kind, nevertheless you see that not even here is there any bodily contact.

The example is certain, but obscure; explain what that virtue is and of what genus of things.

Just as there are two bodies, the mover and the moved, so there are also two powers, by which the movement is administered; one is passive and verges more towards matter, namely the likeness of the planetary body to the solar body, with respect to the bodily form; and there is one part of the planetary body which is friendly to the sun, and the opposite part is unfriendly. The other *power* (*potentia*) is active and smells more of form—that is to say, the solar body has the *force* (*vim*) to attract the planet with respect to its friendly part and to repulse it with respect to its unfriendly part, and finally to keep it, if it were placed thus, so that it does not direct either its 'friendly' or its 'unfriendly' part against the sun.

How can it be that the whole planetary body is like or akin to the solar body, but one part of the planet is friendly to the sun and the other part is unfriendly to the sun?

Doubtless, too, since the loadstone attracts the loadstone, the bodies are akin; but the attraction takes place with respect to one part alone; and the repulsion, with respect to the opposite part. Therefore friendliness and the unfriendliness are named from the effect of rushing together or of flying apart, not from the unlikeness of the bodies.

Whence comes this diversity of the opposite parts of the same body?

In loadstones the diversity comes from the situation of the parts in the whole. For if you break the loadstone AB into two pieces, the newly formed ends (let's call them C and D) of the two pieces are mutually repellent when brought together in a certain orientation. In the original loadstone, these internal points (C and D) were aligned. But if the pieces are put next to one another, so that their former relative situation is restored, then the pieces attract one another.

In the heavens the thing is arranged somewhat differently. For the sun possesses this active and energetic faculty of attracting or repulsing or retaining the planet, not as a loadstone does, in one region, but in all the parts of its body. And so it is believable that the centre of the solar body corresponds to one extremity or region of a loadstone, but the whole surface to the other region of the loadstone. Therefore in the bodies of the planets, that

part or extremity which at the first commencement of things and at the first placing of the planet [519] looked towards the sun is akin to the centre of the sun and is attracted by the sun; but the part which stretched out away from the sun towards the fixed stars came to possess the nature of the surface of the sun; and if it is turned towards the sun, the sun repulses the planet.

In order that I may better understand the effect of the whirling-movement of the sun, say what you judge would have been the case if the sun did not have a whirling-movement.

Just as a loadstone does not stop attracting a loadstone which has its friendly part turned towards it, until it brings the second loadstone into bodily contact and unites it completely to itself; and if the unfriendly part is turned towards it, either it turns the second loadstone around and in the same way attracts the loadstone—which has been turned around; or else, if it cannot turn the loadstone around, it repels it, and in this case the [first] loadstone does not leave any place to the second within the sphere of its virtue, if only it is not hindered. So we must consider in the case of the sun, that if it did not turn around its axis, none of the primary planets would revolve around the sun; but a part of the planets would voyage towards the sun perpetually, until they were united to it by contact; and the part which turn their behind towards the sun would be repulsed towards the fixed stars; but the planets which show their side to the sun would stick to their place and be utterly immobile, while the attractive virtue of the sun struggles with the repulsive.

Then what takes place now by the sun's rotating around its axis?

Indubitably by the turning of the solar body the virtue too is turned, just as by the turning of a loadstone the attractive force of one part is transferred to different regions of the world. And since by means of that virtue of its body the sun has laid hold of the planet, either attracting it or repelling it, or hesitating between the two, it makes the planet also revolve with it and together with the planet perhaps all the surrounding ether. Indeed, it retains them by attraction and repulsion; and by retention it makes them revolve.

If this were the case, would not all the planets make their periodic returns at the same time as the sun?

Yes, if only this were the case. But it has been said before this, that besides this motor force of the sun there is also a natural inertia in the planets themselves with respect to movement: hence by reason of their matter they are inclined to remain in their own place. So the motor power of the sun [*potentia vectoria*] and the powerlessness or material inertia of the planet are at war with one another. Each has its share of victory: the motor power moves the planet from its seat; the material inertia removes its own, i.e., the planetary, body somewhat from those bonds by which it was laid hold of by the sun, so that it is laid hold of first by one part and then by another part of this circle of virtue [*circularis virtutis*] and as it were circumference of the sun—that is, by the part which comes next after the part from which the planet has just loosed itself.

In the diagram, the form [*species*] of the rotated solar body is understood by the outer circle designated by dots; [521] and such a circle is understood to be drawn through any position whatsoever of the planet A, B, C, D, E, E, G, or H. Let the sun, and with the sun its form, turn from right to left: first, let the planet A be laid hold of by that part of the form of the sun which is designated by the ray A; let the ray A be moved through a fixed interval of time as far as the place of the ray D); and let it draw the planet, which however resists and tries to loose itself. Thus, as in the same interval of time the planet is propelled from A to B, so the first ray leaves the planet behind it by the space BD. But in turn, the ray H has succeeded it and lays hold of the planet in B. For as far as A was moved forward to D, so far has H proceeded to B.

But if all things are effected by natural powers which are set at work and at war to move the inertia of matter, how can the planets preserve their periodic times, so that the periodic times are always exactly equal?

More easily than by the assistance of mind. For as the ratio of the total motor virtue to the matter of the globe to be moved is invariable, it follows that the periodic times are perpetually equal.

But why does one planet free itself from this grasp more completely than another, so that Saturn moves only 240 miles in one hour while Mercury moves 1200 miles according to Copernicus?

1.  Because the virtue flowing from the solar body has the same degrees of weakness in different intervals which the intervals themselves have, or the amplitude of the spheres described with these intervals: that is the mightiest cause.
2.  Moreover there is something of a cause in the inertia of the planetary globes or in the greater or less resistance, whereby the ratio only half corresponds; but more of this somewhat later on.

The body of the planet is always the same but it is repelled by the sun and attracted to it, as you wish; therefore it passes through different degrees of motor virtue: therefore the ratio of the power to the planetary body does not remain constant.

Not absolutely, if we consider the parts of one revolution; and so the same planet becomes faster in one part of its revolution, as above in E, than in another part A, as will be said below. But in spite of this the general total motor virtue [*collecta universa virtus vectoria*] throughout all those degrees through which the planet passes during one revolution always and at every restitution is of the same magnitude.

How is it possible that the virtue flowing from the body of the sun should be weaker in the greater interval at A than near the sun at E? What weakens the virtue or makes it feeble?

Because that virtue is corporeal and partakes of quantity: wherefore it can be dispersed and thinned out. Therefore since as much power is diffused throughout the very wide orbital circle of Saturn as is collected in the very narrow orbital circle of Mercury: therefore it is very thin throughout the parts of the orbital circle of Saturn, and hence it is very feeble; but it is most dense at Mercury and hence is very strong.

If it were a question of the body of the sun, I might grant to it this natural power of moving: but you draw out this material power from the body and place it without a subject in the very spacious ether. Doesn't this seem absurd?

[523] That it should not seem absurd is clear from the example of the loadstone, to which this same objection can be made. But in neither case is this force without a proportional subject. For in this way at the very source the subject of the natural faculty is the body of the sun, or the threads stretching out from the centre to its circumference; thus even in this very emanation, I think a rational distinction should be made between the immaterial form [*speciem*] of the solar body, which flows as far as the planets and beyond, and its force or energy which actually lays hold of the planet and moves it—so that the form is the subject of the force, though it is not a body but an immaterial form of a body.

Could you give an example of this thing?

There is a true example in the light and heat of the sun. There is no doubt but that just as the whole sun is luminous, so it is all on fire, and that on account of the density of its matter it should indeed be compared to a glowing mass of gold, or to anything else which may be denser. Now from that light [*ex luce illa*] of the sun there emanates and comes down to us a form which is not corporeal, not material, which we call the illumination [*lumen*] or rays of the sun and which however is subject to dimensions and accidents. For it flows on straight lines and may be condensed or rarefied, and may indeed be cut by a mirror and by glass, namely, by reflection and refraction, as we are taught in Optics. Moreover, this form of the sun's light [*lucis*] bears its heat with it; and in proportion to the greatness or smallness of the strength whereby it falls upon bodies which can be illuminated, it warms them to a greater or to a lesser extent.

Therefore just as that form (*species*) or illumination (*lumen*)—which form we know with certainty to flow down from the light (*luce*) of the sun—is the subject of the heat-giving faculty, which has similarly been extended from the sun, through a form; so too the solar body's immaterial form, come down as far as the planets, has as its companion the form of that energetic virtue (*speciem illius virtutis energeticae*) in the solar body; and this form strives to unite like things to itself and to repel unlike.

There is a more clear example in this same light: when it passes through coloured glass or coloured weavings or has been communicated to coloured surfaces, [524] it itself is coloured. Hence, it cannot be denied that, although the light is an immaterial form of the light which flowed into the coloured body, it becomes the subject of that colour and as it were even the outward-going vehicle of it.

What if this very light and not some other form from the body of the sun were the subject of the prehensive faculty whereby the sun lays hold of the planetary bodies?

Not absolutely; for it seems rather that we should take it that an immaterial form flows off from its body, in which form the prehensive force and the light inhere, but in the light the colour and heat—each of them drawn from its own source.

State the reasons for this distinction between the immaterial forms from one and the same solar globe,

1.  The matter of the solar body must be something distinct from the light in it. For the movement of rays of light in a straight line takes place in an instant; but the turning of the solar body takes place in time. But if we were to postulate that the bare form of the light is the subject and vehicle of the prehensive virtue, then one and alone the light of the sun could lay claim to being the whole essence of its body. For the same thing which is found in the form from the thing is found in the thing as in its origin [*originaliter*].
2.  Dimensionality applies to emanated light doubtless not wholly by reason of the inward essence of the light, but by reason of something different from the light itself, namely, because the light is in a body of some certain magnitude and because the forms emanate together as much from body as from light.
3.  The form of light emanates from the surface of the luminous body, or if really from the depths of a pellucid body, still as if from the surface. And so the light is considered as a surface, [525] and it has the same properties which other surfaces have with respect to movement and impact; but the body which is beneath the illuminated surface suffers nothing, because nothing has come down from the inward corporeality of the source of light: now the force laying hold of a body must necessarily come down from a body, so that there may be a moving cause which is proportional to its movable object. And so it is subject to bodily dimensions and moves bodies: not only with respect to the surface but also winding its way into their very matter.
4.  Hence, too, no matter on the surface of the object resists the light in such a way that the surface is not illuminated instantaneously; but what resists the light, i.e., something opaque, resists it perpetually and is never overcome, as long as it remains opaque. But the virtue which lays hold does not overcome every whit: for the resistance of matter in the planetary body stands up against it and restricts it: hence the planet does not follow exactly the forward movement of the prehensive force, but is left behind and abandoned by it and in that mutual struggle there is place for time.
5.  There is the same reason for the further difference that light is bounded and stopped by the surfaces of opaque bodies, so that it goes on no farther into other bodies lying in the same straight line. But this force which moves the planet by laying hold of it is not stopped by its surface, but goes into the body which it lays hold of, and moreover goes on through the body into the body of a farther planet, if it so happens that two planets are on a straight line with the sun: consequently the movement is not disturbed at all by the interposition of bodies. But if movement arose from the illumination of light, this would be absurd; for as often as the higher planet was eclipsed by the lower, so often and so long would its movement cease until the lower planet by its speed should remove itself from the line [with the sun].
6.  Finally, that the planetary movement is not necessarily from the naked light of the sun is shown by the examples of other things where movement similar to the celestial movements takes place without light, as can be seen in the case of the loadstone; and this will be shown below by the example of the moon, which is moved by the earth, a body which is luminous to the least extent. And even if at that time the illumination of the earth and the moon has a share [526] and even if it co-operates in many ways in moving the moon, nevertheless it does not do that *per se*, but merely strengthens the motor form from the earth (*specimen motricem telluris*), as will be said in the proper place.

What is the likeness between the form of light and the form of this prehensive virtue?

There is a very close likeness in the genesis and conditions of both forms: the descent of each from the luminous body takes place instantaneously; each remains of average greatness and smallness without loss, is not taxed; nothing perishes in the journey from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the illuminable or movable thing.

Therefore each is an immaterial outflow, not like the outflow of odours, which are conjoined to a decrease of the substance; not like the outflow of heat from a raging furnace, or anything similar, by which the spaces in between are filled. For this form is not anywhere except in the opposite and withstanding body; the form of the light on its opaque surface, but the form from the motor virtue in the total corporeality: but in the intermediate space between the sun and the surface, the form is not but has been. But if they were to meet the concave spherical surface of an opaque body, both solar forms would be scattered in that concavity together with all that abundance with which they have emanated from the body of the sun: in this way as much of the form would be in a wide and farther-away sphere of this sort as is in the narrow and nearer sphere. And since the ratio of convex spheres is the ratio of the squares of their diameters: therefore the form will be made weaker in unequal spheres in the ratio of the square of its distance. And again because circles have the same simple ratio as their diameters: therefore in longitude the form is weaker in the same ratio of its distance from its source.

Where are the arguments for this comparison gotten from?

These properties of light have been demonstrated in optics. [527] The same things are proved by analogy concerning the motor power of the sun, keeping the difference between the works of illumination and movement and between the objects of each. And these same things are found to be consonant with astronomical experiments.

For since one and the same planet, as will be said below, in parts of the eccentric circle which are really equal but are at unequal distances from the sun, makes unequal delays and does that in this very ratio of the distances; therefore it follows that the motor virtue is attenuated in longitude in the same ratio wherein the light is attenuated in longitude, namely in the ratio of the amplitude of the circles which have those distances or semidiameters. In this diagram, let the sun be S, the same planet CA as nearer and FD as farther away. And let DH and AI be equal parts of the eccentric circle—that is to say, at opposite positions on the eccentric circle. Let DH be the farther away, and AI the nearer. Accordingly as SD is to SA, so the delay of the planet in DH is to the delay of the planet in AI. From this it also follows that as SD is to SA, so inversely is the density of the light at the position CA, which is at a lower distance, to the density of the light at the position FD, which is farther away.

[528] But if the light is attenuated in the ratio of the squares of the intervals, i.e., in the ratio of the surfaces; why therefore does not the motor virtue too become weaker in the ratio of the squares rather than in the simple?

Because the motor virtue has as subject a form from the solar body, not according as it is merely body but according as it is set in motion in a revolution around its immobile axis and poles.

Therefore even if the form from the solar body is attenuated in longitude and in latitude no less than the light is; nevertheless this attenuation contributes towards the weakening of the motor virtue only by reason of the longitude: for the local movement which the sun gives to the planets takes place only in longitude, wherein even the parts of the solar body are mobile, not also in latitude towards the poles of the body with respect to which the sun is immobile.

But nevertheless the movable bodies have latitude no less than longitude. Wherefore they are borne by this virtue so that they each have their latitude as well as longitude. Therefore why is not this motor virtue weakened in latitude, and that in the ratio of the squares of the intervals?

Indeed the planetary bodies have not only these two dimensions but also the third dimension of thickness or altitude; and they occupy this virtue clearly in three ways: and exactly for that reason the prehensive, vehicular, and motor virtue of one planet is not one circle lacking latitude, but is constituted of an infinite number as it were of circles parallel in latitude and in altitude. But it does not accordingly follow that the attenuation of this virtue should be in the ratio of the squares or cubes of the intervals or semidiameters. For just as elsewhere in geometry equimultiples have the same ratio: so also here in physics, as one least physical line—as a part of the planetary body—is to the thinness of one circle of virtue, in the simple ratio of the intervals; so is an infinity of least physical lines—as all the parts of the planetary body laid out in latitude as well as in altitude—to the same number of circles of the motor virtue, which all together and singly have force to move merely in longitude; but neither singly nor taken all together do they have any force to move in latitude or in altitude. Therefore, just as the single lines or solitary threads of two planetary bodies would be moved by the single circles of motor virtue in the simple ratio of the intervals; so, taken together, all the threads of the planetary globe are moved by all the circles of motor virtue, taken together, in the same simple proportion: for the latitude and altitude of the motor virtue is not of its essence but of the accidents of the movable thing.

Nevertheless are not these statements concerning the form from the solar body and from the solar virtue, which makes the planets and the Earth in particular revolve, more difficult to believe than the former statements of the philosophers concerning intelligences, motor souls, and solid spheres?

Their being more difficult to believe is no disadvantage, provided they are easy to comprehend; and the objection made against the spheres and the intelligences cannot be made against them—or any other objection wherein the charge of impossibility is made.

For in the first place, wherever they exceed belief there is none the less a true example in the loadstone. Then, if anyone should doubt whether the faculties of a loadstone, i.e., terrestrial faculties, are present in the heavens, or whether the Earth, a heavy body, could be transported from place to place by an immaterial form from the sun; let him regard the moon, which is so much akin to the Earth: he sees it revolve without any solid sphere underlying it. [530] But that bodily forms which pass one another back and forth are strong enough to cause movement is shown by this same moon, which moves the seas on the Earth by the form given out. So we are not lacking in examples. And the mode by which we perceive in mind what sort of form it is does not disturb us: alone the unbelievable strength [*fortitudo*] of this form keeps us in doubt. And indeed we can rightly answer here with Ptolemy that it is never proper to appraise the virtues of divine works according to our weakness, or their greatness according to our smallness.

Now the appraisal of mode and figures belongs to mind; but in this appraisal there should be no judgment of greatness or smallness, i.e., of indefinite quantities.

## 4. On the Causes of the Ratio of the Periodic Times

In the beginning of this consideration of movement you said that the periodic times of the planets are found to be quite exactly in the ratio of the 3/2th powers of their orbits or circles. I ask what the cause of this thing is.

Four causes come together in establishing the length of the periodic time. The first is the length of the route; the second is the weight or the amount [*copia*] of matter to be transported; the third is the strength of the motor virtue; the fourth is the bulk [*moles*] or space in which the matter to be transported is unrolled. For as is the case in a mill, where the wheel is turned by the force of the stream, so that, the wider and longer the wings, planks, or oars which you fasten to the wheel, the greater the force of the stream pouring through the width and depth which you will divert into the machine; so too that is the case in this celestial vortex of the solar form moving rapidly in a gyro—and this form causes the movement. [531] Consequently the more space the body—A or D in this case—occupies, the more widely and deeply it occupies the motor virtue, as in this case BCA understood according to its width; and the more swiftly, other things being equal, is it borne forward; and the more quickly does it complete its periodic journey.

But the circular journeys of the planets are in the simple ratio of the intervals. For as SA is to SD, so too is the whole circle BA to the whole circle ED. But the weight, or the amount of matter in the different planets, is in the ratio of the 1/2th powers of the intervals, as was proved above, so that always the higher planet has more matter and is moved the more slowly and piles up the more time in its period, since even before now by reason of its journey it would have wanted more time. For with SK taken as a mean proportional between SA and SD, the intervals of the two planets; as SK is to the greater distance SD, so the amount of matter in the planet A is to the amount in the planet D. But the third and fourth causes balance one another in the comparison of the different planets. But the simple ratio of the intervals plus the ratio of the 1/2th powers constitute the ratio of the 3/2th powers of the same. Therefore the periodic times are in the ratio of the 3/2th powers of the intervals. Consequently if SD, SK, SA, and SL are continued [mean] proportionals, then SL will be to SD [532] as the time period of planet A is to the time period of planet D.

Prove, in comparing two planets, that the weakening of the motor virtue is exactly balanced by the amplitude wherewith the movable planetary bodies occupy the virtue.

The bulks or expanses of the bodies are in the simple and direct ratio of the intervals, as was demonstrated above. That is, as SA is to SD, so is the bulk of the planetary body at A to the bulk of the other planet at D. But too the motor virtue is dense and strong, in the simple ratio of the intervals but inversely; for as the same interval SA is to SD, so the strength of the form CA is to the strength of the form FD. Therefore the virtue is in turn occupied in the same ratio in which it is weakened; for example, Saturn is borne by a power ten times feebler than the virtue by which the Earth is; but conversely, it occupies with its body ten times more of the virtue of its region than the Earth with its body occupies of the virtue of its region. And let the total virtue which Saturn occupies by its bulk be divided into ten parts which are equal in expanse (*spatio*) to the total virtue which the Earth occupies. Any one of these parts or expanses of virtue has only one tenth of the strength which that one part which is occupied by the Earth has, wherefore those ten parts added together into one are equal in power (*potestate*) to that one part by which the Earth is borne. And so if in the amplitude of the more rarefied globe of Saturn there were not more matter than in the narrowness of the denser terrestrial body, the globe of Saturn in one year would be borne along as great a distance of its orbit as is the length of the whole orbit of the Earth; and thus in ten years it would complete its proper orbit. But in fact it has approximately thrice as much matter and weight as the Earth does; wherefore it requires thrice as long a time, namely thirty years.

[533] What need was there to teach of this balancing? Would it not have been enough for establishing a demonstration to set down that there is absolutely no cause for such an irregular movement as this either in the different grades of the motor virtue or in the different amplitudes of the planetary globes?

Now for the demonstration that the ratio of the different periods of the planets is the ratio of the 3/2th power of the intervals, it would have made no difference whether this or that were set down. But if we had progressed to the different delays of one and the same planet at different intervals, we could not have established from the same genus of things the reason why the delays in arcs which are exactly equal should follow the ratio of the intervals.

Then what is the reason why the farther distant from the sun any equal arc of the eccentric circle is, the longer delays does the planet make in that arc, and in the ratio of the intervals?

The reason is indeed the weakening of the motor virtue: just as light is SD

The longer interval from the sun is diffused more thinly along the length FD than is the diffusion of that same [virtue] in the shorter interval SA. And so what of the virtue was at that time occupied by the body of the planet, as FD, is weaker than what of the denser virtue is occupied by the same [body] CA, which is nearer.

For here the three remaining causes are missing. For the arc or route is assumed in both cases to be of the same length, as DH and AI; the density of the body remains the same, and the magnitude of the figure likewise; because FD and CA are in this case one and the same planet. The strength of the virtue alone is left. But more on this in the following.

In this case we seem to meet a greater difficulty than above. For when the planet is nearer to the sun, it occupies not only longer arcs of the circles of the motor virtue but also denser arcs: wherefore should it not extend its delays, in the ratio of the squares rather than in the simple ratio of the intervals?

Now the same thing is said as above, and the same answer is made. For even if Saturn at that time did not come down into the sphere of the Earth: nevertheless we were comparing the expanse of power occupied by Saturn not merely with that which the Earth would have occupied in the sphere of Saturn but also with that which the Earth would occupy in its own sphere. Therefore, as before, the fact that the circles are denser (*confertiores*) is to be assigned to the form from the body; and this form is something distinct from the inhering motor virtue, which extends in longitude alone and gets no advantage from the condensation of its subject in latitude—unless a thin line without width (*latitudine carens*) has no natural force in length (*in longum*); where the width (*latitudo*) of such a line is judged not by the density but by the expanse, namely on account of the width of the bodies to be moved, as I taught above.

## 5. On the Annual Movement of the Earth

Accordingly this philosophy of Copernicus makes the Earth one of the planets and sets it revolving among the stars: I ask what, besides what has been said, is required for the easier perception of the teaching and the arguments.

Since the annual movement of the Earth becomes necessary, because it has been postulated that the centre of the sun is at rest at the centre of the world, and since this movement is caused by the revolution of the sun in that space and clearly removes the reality of the stopping and retrogradation of the planets and explains them as a mere deception of sight: we must distinguish carefully the following questions: (1) Whether the sun sticks to the centre of the world. (2) Whether all the five spheres of the planets and the middle sphere of the Earth are drawn up around the sun, so that the sun is in the embrace of all. (3) Whether the sun occupies the very centre of the whole planetary system, or whether it stands outside of that. (4) Whether this centre of the system and the sun in it revolve in an annual movement, or whether the Earth has an annual movement through the sections opposite to those in which the sun is thought to be moving at any time.

You have proved above that (1) the sun is at the centre of the sphere of the fixed stars. Now prove also that (2) it is within the embrace of the planetary spheres.

That the sun is at the centre of the planetary revolutions is proved first from an accident of this movement, namely, the appearance of stoppings and retrogradings, which are deceptions of sight, or even because the planets seem to be faster when progressing than they really are.

For to begin with the lower planets, now for a long time during the many ages which followed Ptolemy—let us say nothing at present of ancient Aristarchus—it was perceived by the authors Martianus Capella, Campanus, and others, that it is not possible for the sun, Venus, and Mercury to have the same period of time, namely, a year, unless they have the same sphere, and unless the sun is at the centre of the two spheres of Venus and Mercury, and these planets revolve around the sun: for that reason, when these planets seem to retrograde, they are not really retrograding but are advancing in the same direction in the sphere of the fixed stars but are going around the sun. And that is more consonant with the nature of celestial things.

A few years ago Galileo confirmed this argument by a very clear demonstration: by means of a telescope he disclosed the illumination of Venus. When Venus is progressing and is in the neighbourhood of the sun, it has a round figure; when retrograding, a horn-shaped figure. For from this it is proven with the utmost certainty that its illumination comes from the sun, that when Venus appears round and progresses straight ahead, it is above the sun; but that when it is horn-shaped and retrograding, it is below the sun, and that it thus revolves around the sun. Let the demonstration of this thing by reason of light be joined to the demonstrations of the illuminations of the moon. In the case of Mercury, Marius brings forward similar things by the aid of the telescope: the feebleness of its light was recognized as the planet came down to the Earth: and that is a sign that the form (*speciem*) of the illumination is changed and the light has become weaker in the horn, so that it moves the eye less when near than when far away. And that would be absurd without this weakening in the horn; because elsewhere things which are nearer appear greater than if they had drawn away farther. Now as regards the three upper planets, Aristarchus, Copernicus, and Tycho Brahe demonstrate that if we set them in order around the sun and put the sun as, so to speak, the common centre of the five planets, so that the movement of the sun, whether true or apparent, affects all the spheres of the five planets, we are freed—as before in the case of Venus and Mercury, from two eccentric circles, so now in the upper planets—(1) from three epicycles; (2) from the blind unbelievable harmony of their real movement with the movement of the sun; (3) and just as above in the case of Venus and Mercury, they have no real stations and retrogradations with respect to the sun, around which they revolve; (4) thus also very many complications in the latitudinal movement are removed from the doctrine of the schemata; (5) and finally the reasons are disclosed for the difference which makes the five planets become stationary and retrograding, but never the sun and the moon; and (6) why Saturn, the highest of the upper planets, has the least arc of retrogradation; Jupiter, the middle one, the middle arc; and Mars, the nearest one, the greatest arc. All these things will be explained below in Book VI. But the ancient astronomers were totally ignorant of the reasons for these appearances.

3. But even the secondary planets bear some witness to this thing. For Marius found that in the world of Jupiter the restitutions of the Jovian satellites around Jupiter are never regular with respect to the lines which we cast out from the centre of the Earth to Jupiter; but that they are regular, if they are compared with the lines drawn through Jupiter from the centre of the sun. And that argues strongly that the orbit of Jupiter is arranged around the sun and that the distance of the sun from the centre of the orbit of Jupiter is sure and somehow fixed; but that throughout the year the Earth varies its distances from this centre.

How many sects of astronomers are there with respect to this theory, from which the second argument is drawn?

Three: the first, commonly known by the name of the ancients, nevertheless has Ptolemy as its coryphaeus; the second and third are ascribed to the moderns. Though the second, named after Copernicus, is the oldest, Tycho Brahe is the founder of the third.

Accordingly Ptolemy treats the single wandering stars only separately, and he ascribes the apparent causes of all the movements, retrogradations, and stations, to their separate spheres. Nonetheless in the case of each planet he sets down one unchanging sphere which completes its period with respect to the movement of the sun: but Ptolemy does not explain from what causes that comes about—unless the Latin writers, hypnotized by their complete ignorance of the rays, attribute some obscure force to the constant rays of the sun.

The remaining two founders compare the planets with one another; and the things which are found to be common to their movements are deduced from the same common cause. But this common cause, which makes the planets seem stationary and retrograding in some fixed configuration of the planet and the sun, is still attributed by Brahe to the real movement of all the planetary spheres; but it is completely removed by Copernicus from the spheres of the planets. For Brahe teaches that all the five spheres of the primary planets are bound together at some common point, which is not far distant from the centre of each sphere—as if here all the spheres were described in the common circular table B—and that this, so to speak, common node or knot really revolves with the sun during the year, and that very near to this node the sun—in the small circle made with dots—makes all the spheres revolve along with itself; and so to speak dislocates them from their own regions in the world—in the manner wherein bolters, grasping a sieve by one part of its rim, turn it with their hands and shake it; hence, for example, the position of the whole planetary system during the month of June is along circle B, during August along C, during October along D, during December along E, during February along F, during March along G, whence once more along [A]; meanwhile, the planet, which has not been disturbed at all by this dislocation of its sphere, completes its own circle on the sphere around its, as it were, fixed centre. But as regards the time of one year, Copernicus leaves the centres of the spheres absolutely fixed and also the centre of the sun fixed in the neighbourhood of the aforesaid centres. But he ascribes to the Earth, and thus to our eyesight, an annual movement around the sun: hence, since our eyesight thinks that itself is at rest, the sun seems to move with an annual movement and all the five planets seem now to stop, now to go in the opposite direction, now to advance forward very fast.

So by what arguments do you prove (3) that that common node or centre of all the primary systems is not [merely] very near to the sun but is in the body of the sun at its centre?

In the teaching of astronomy the following arguments for this thing are drawn:

1.  From the movement of altitude and longitude of the planets. Observations duly taken bear witness that the longest line in the schema of each and every primary planet, which exactly bisects the orbital circle into two semicircles equal in the magnitude and speed of their parts, passes through the centre of the sun. Therefore all the five lines of altitude always meet at the centre of the sun. See the diagram on page 862.

2.  From the movement of latitude of the planets. For we learn from the same class of things, that is, from observations, that the orbit of each and every primary planet is cut by the ecliptic at the positions opposite the centre of the sun, not opposite any other neighbouring point.

3.  But if the centre of the sun and the centre of the region of the movable bodies were different, then the very slow movement in the small circle would have to be ascribed either to the centre of the sun or to the centre of the region of the movable bodies, on account of the progression of the apogee of the sun, as will be taught in Books VI and VII. And thus the one of these two which moves could not either be or remain at the centre of the world. But it is probable that both of them are at the centre of the world and are at rest there: the sun does so on account of the preceding and following arguments. But the node of the movable bodies does so by reason of being the source of movement, and we have already said that this movement starts from this common centre of the movable bodies. But stillness belongs to the source; and on account of stillness, a place at the centre of the movable bodies and at the centre of the whole world.

4.  The seat to be assigned to this same source of movement is not in any mathematical point, very near to the most noble body, but rather in that most noble body, for three reasons: first, in order for us to avoid the absurdity that the source of movement—which is necessarily set down as being at that common node of all the spheres, as will be proved below—should be very near to the heart of the world, but nevertheless should not be at the very heart of the world, namely, the sun; secondly, because the motor force cannot reside in a mathematical point but requires a body, namely, the heart of the world, the sun; thirdly, because the motor force absolutely demands for itself the centre of the world, where the sun itself is: just as stillness belongs to the surface of the world, so movement belongs to the inside.

5.  But in especial, the following thing must be taken out of the reach of Brahe's judgement and be demonstrated: that the centre of the region of the movable bodies does not differ from the centre of the sun. For if Brahe admits this, he will be forced to assign some movement to the sun; and he will be forced to admit that besides the centre of the sun, there is another, different centre for the movable bodies; and by this movement it comes about that the sun now precedes this centre, now follows it, now stands above, now stands below; and nevertheless both always have the same period of time.

(6) As a matter of fact, something absurd and surprising would happen to Brahe. For the sun would be moved by an eccentric movement, having its apsis today in Cancer. But the centre of the movable bodies would have the apsis of its eccentric movement in the opposite sign of Capricorn. But what would be the reason for this thing?

(7) These two last arguments furnish an argument against Copernicus also inasmuch as he places that common node of the planets very near to the sun, but not in the sun itself. For the movements of all the remaining primary planets agree in the fact that the points around which their movements appear regular are different in position from the common centre of the region of the movable bodies: the Earth alone would keep this point as the measure of its movement, if the sun were not in the centre of the region of the movable bodies. But what would be the cause of this difference?

(8) Finally the reason why Copernicus and Brahe make these two centres different is not sufficient nor astronomical enough. For they were led to that by the fact that they wished in the forms of their hypotheses to express their everyway equipollence to the Ptolemaic form. But it was not necessary that they should step exactly in Ptolemy's footprints. For indeed Ptolemy did not build up all the parts of his hypothesis from observations, but he based many things upon the preconceived and false opinion that it is necessary to presuppose that the movements of the planets are regular throughout the whole circle—and that is demonstrated by observations to be false. Let anyone who wishes fully to understand these astronomical arguments which are placed here under one aspect—let him go to my *Commentaries on the Movements of the Planet Mars*,

Finally by what arguments do you prove (4) that the centre of the sun, which is at the midpoint of the planetary spheres and bears their whole system—does not revolve in some annual movement, as Brahe wishes, but in accordance with Copernicus sticks immobile in one place, while the centre of the Earth revolves in an annual movement?

Even though the other necessarily follows from the demonstration of the one, nevertheless certain arguments pertain more closely to the sun and certain to the Earth; and certain others equally to both.

First on this side was the same argument whereby we just now claimed for the sun the midpoint of the spheres: namely, that the superfluous multitude of spheres and movements has been removed. For as it is much more probable that there should be some one system of spheres of the sun and that it should be common to the centre of the sun and to that node of the five spheres, according to Tycho Brahe, than that we should believe according to Ptolemy that in any one of the five planets, over and above the spheres which have to do with their proper movements, there is present one whole system of spheres exactly like the sixth system of the sun; so also it is now much more probable that the centre of one Earth should revolve in an annual movement and the sun be at rest, according to Copernicus, than that, according to Brahe, this node of the five systems together with the spheres and planets themselves and the sun as a sixth should have the same annual movement besides the other movements which are proper to each. For even though Brahe removed from the true systems of the planets those five superfluous schemata of Ptolemy, which are like those of the sun, and reduced them to that common node of the systems, hid them, and melted them down into one; nevertheless he left in the world the very thing which was effected by those schemata: that any planet, over and above that movement which must really be granted to it, should be moved by the movement of the sun and should mix both into that one movement. And since there are no solid spheres, from this mixing there are caused in the expanse of the world very involved spirals. See the diagram of this involution in my *Commentaries on Mars*, folium 3.

Copernicus on the contrary by means of this one simple movement of the centre of the Earth stripped the five planets completely of this extrinsic movement of the sun, and made the centres of the six primary planets—that is, the Earth and the remaining five—each describe singly a simple and always similar orbit, or line very close to a circle, in the expanse of the world.

The second argument is from the movement in latitude. If epicycles revolve around an Earth at rest, either according to Ptolemy or according to Brahe, it will be necessary for those epicycles, especially those of the lower planets, in different ways to seek the sides as well as the head and feet, that is, to have a twofold libration. But with the Earth in motion, all the orbital circles have a constant inclination to the ecliptic. See Book VI, Part III where the latitudes of the lower planets supply us with a very clear argument for the movement of the Earth.

Thirdly, just as above, in the doctrine on the sphere, the diurnal revolution of the Earth being granted, the immense sphere of the fixed stars was freed from a diurnal movement of incalculable speed; so now, an annual movement being granted to this same Earth after the model of the other planets, we have ended that very slow movement of the fixed stars, which is called by Copernicus the precession of the equinoxes. See Book VII as regards these things. For it is much more believable to attribute them to the axis of the Earth, a very small body, than to such a great bulk.

Fourthly, the consideration of the ratios of the spheres wars on this side. For it is by no means probable that the centre of a great sphere should revolve in a small sphere. For the proper spheres of the three upper planets are much greater than the sphere of the sun—Saturn's approximately ten times greater; Jupiter's five times; Mars' one and a half times. Therefore these five spheres are not carried around or dislocated from their position; but their centres remain approximately fixed, and, as a consequence, instead of this movement common to them and to the sun, the Earth revolves.

The fifth argument, which is related to the preceding one, is the same as that whereby Brahe tried to disprove the solidity of the spheres. For if Brahe's reasoning holds, as the orbit of Mars is one and a half times the orbit of the sun, so the body of Mars at fixed times returns to that point in the world's expanse where the sun was at other times. And it is quite unbelievable that the regions which the primary planets pass through should be so jumbled together; since in Copernicus they are not only distinct, but are kept separate by very large intervals of emptiness.

I make the sixth argument similar to the fourth: from the magnitude of the movable bodies. For it is more believable that the body around which the smaller bodies revolve should be great. For just as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury are all smaller bodies than the solar body around which they revolve; so the moon is smaller than the Earth around which the moon revolves; so the four satellites of Jupiter are smaller than the body of Jupiter itself, around which they revolve. But if the sun moves, the sun which is the greatest, and the three higher planets which are all greater than the Earth, will revolve around the Earth which is smaller. Therefore it is more believable that the Earth, a small body, should revolve around the great body of the sun.

The seventh reason is drawn from the reasons for the intervals, which were unfolded above in the first part of this book. These reasons are disturbed and maimed, unless we grant to the Earth too its own sphere, which Copernicus gives to it between the spheres of Mars and of Venus. For even if the interval between Saturn and Jupiter could be deduced from the cube, that of Jupiter and Mars from the tetrahedron, and that of Venus and Mercury from the octahedron, even in Brahe's ordering: yet there would still remain between Mars and Venus a single interval. But there remain two figures in the number of figures of the world. And the interval between Mars and Venus, which is in a greater ratio than double would not square with one of these figures, the dodecahedron or the icosahedron; nor could it be deduced from two figures, not even by the interposition of some sphere between them.

Eighthly, the same things are to be said concerning the harmony of the celestial movements, which are made up of the same numbers and proportions as our musical scale. And if you consider the excellence of the work or the pleasantness of contemplation, or finally the unavoidable force of the persuasion, this harmony can truly be called the soul and life of all astronomy. But this harmony is at last complete only if the Earth in its own place and rank among the planets strikes its own string and as it were sings its note through a variation of a semitone: otherwise there would be no manifesting of its semitone, and that again is the soul of the song. As a matter of fact, if the semitone of the Earth is gone, there is destroyed from among the celestial movements the manifesting of the genera of song, i.e., the major and the minor modes, the most pleasant, most subtle, and most wonderful thing in this whole discussion. But concerning this in the *Harmonies*[^1].

Ninthly, if we consider the force of Brahe's ordering and if we image for ourselves some matter of the five dislocatable spheres, which matter together with the region of the movable bodies is dislocated by the annual movement; then in this matter, in this, I say, celestial sphere which extends throughout all the planetary regions, the Earth even when at rest will describe such an orbit around the sun as Copernicus assigned to it between the spheres of Mars and Venus—the sun and the centre of the region of the movable bodies being at rest.

And so by an absurd and unfitting reason a joke leads us from a distance to the same beauty—namely, that the Earth should progress along one circle or sphere, while being at rest. It is more believable that the sixth orbit of the Earth is described by the real movement of the very Earth, just as the remaining five orbits are described by the same number of movements.

The tenth argument, taken from the periodic time, is as follows: the apparent movement of the sun has 365 days, which is the mean measure between Venus' period of 225 days and Mars' period of 687 days. Therefore does not the nature of things shout out loud that the circuit in which those 365 days are taken up

[^1]: See pp. 1009 ff.

has the mean position between the circuits of Mars and of Venus around the Sun: and thus this is not the circuit of the Sun around the Earth — for none of the primary planets has its orbit arranged around the Earth, as Brahe admits — but the circuit of the Earth around the resting Sun, just as the other primary planets, namely Mars and Venus, complete their own periods by running around the Sun?

The eleventh argument is taken from the motor causes — by the supposition of Brahe’s opinion, though it is not admitted by all. For because there are no solid spheres, therefore the motor faculties can be placed nowhere except in the movable bodies. But thus the condition of the motor souls will become mightily hard, and harder that of the intelligences, while the motor souls are ordered to transport the body, in which they are, from place to place by a twofold movement, without the resistance of anything, but the intelligences are ordered to look to very many things — so that they may carry the planet in its own rank by two in all respects distinct and mixed-together movements. For at least at one and the same moment they are forced to look to the beginnings, centre, periods, and figures of either movement. But if the Sun is at rest and the Earth is moved, each planet has only one movement, and that movement can be effected by bodily magnetic powers. For there is barely need of the animal faculty for the one revolution of the solar body, but there is absolutely no need anywhere for the supervision of mind. See my *Commentaries on Mars, passim*.

The twelfth is from the source of movement. For it has just been demonstrated in many ways, and it will be confirmed below, that every movement of the primary planets, and in part even the secondary planets, arises from the Sun. But it is right to believe that the first cause of movement is immobile. Therefore the Sun remains immobile in its own place — and as a consequence the Earth moves in an annual movement, in place of the Sun.

The thirteenth is from motor instruments. For if we let the Sun and the Earth revolve around their own axes, then the forms from these bodies (*horum corporum species*) become the subjects of the motor powers by which the six planets are moved by the Sun, and the Moon by the Earth. But if the Sun revolves in an annual movement while the Earth is at rest, then no form from a body, which form should introduce movement, is at hand for moving the Sun. And if the Earth does not revolve around its axis once a day, it does not have anything whereby it may move the Moon. But this argument urges the daily movement more strongly [than the annual].

The fourteenth argument is from the movement in longitude. If the Sun moves, carrying around with it the system of all the spheres, something novel occurs in the case of the Sun. For some body will move itself, or else it surely will be moved by some special outside mover, since the other primary bodies are moved by one common Sun, and thus by something other than themselves. But if the Earth moves in a circle and is also moved by the Sun, like the other primary bodies, nothing novel happens. And so it is probable that the Earth is moved, for a probable cause of its movement appears; and it is probable that the Sun remains fixed.

The fifteenth argument is from the movement in altitude. It has already been said in part, and it will be demonstrated below more fully, that all the planets have a movement of libration in a straight line, which proceeds towards the Sun and by means of this libration obey the laws of their speed and slowness in any position on the eccentric circle. And thus it is certain that the Sun is the cause of this variation in all five planets. But it has been demonstrated in the *Commentaries on Mars* that the same thing takes place on the Earth, if it moves, namely that the Earth too has a libration along its diameter in the direction of the Sun. But if it is put down that the Sun is moving, then on the contrary the Earth becomes the cause of the Sun's slowness and speed and thus of its revolution too. But indeed let the bodies of the Sun and the Earth themselves be viewed, and let the judgment be made as to whether it is more probable that the Sun, which is the source of movement of the five planets and is many times greater than the Earth, should be moved by the Earth, or whether on the contrary the Earth, one among the primary planets, should be moved by the common source of movement of the remaining planets. See the *Commentaries on Mars*.

The sixteenth probability is as follows. Now in *Book I* it was maintained by many arguments and by the refutations of their contraries that the Earth has a diurnal rotation around its axis, and among those arguments not the weakest were as follows: If the Earth is put down as having a diurnal movement, the final and instrumental cause of the obliquity of the ecliptic can be taken from this same Earth; and, with the Earth at rest, neither of these [causes] can be explained, nor can they be sought from the sphere of the fixed stars, wherein the zodiac is, without a glance at this petty little body which is called Earth. Therefore the transportation of the centre of the Earth can no longer be absurd. But the probability is sufficient, if the remaining arguments demand the thing itself. For this is not to be offered as a necessary argument: because even though the Sun rotates around its own axis, nevertheless it is immovable in place as a whole.

The seventeenth reason: If the Earth revolves in an annual movement, not only do we find a more probable cause for the precession of the equinoxes than if we assign this variation to the Sun, the first body; but also by this same means we give a reason for the irregular progression of the planetary nodes, and by the inclination of the axis of the diurnal movement of the Earth we explain the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, just as in the case of some irregularity in the precession of the equinoxes — which irregularity we disproved by the third argument. But one must necessarily be profoundly ignorant of the causes of so many of these phenomena, if the Earth does not revolve in an annual movement.

Let the eighteenth argument come from the end of movement, by which it is proved that movement belongs to the Earth as the home of the speculative creature. For it was not fitting that man, who was going to be the dweller in this world and its contemplator, should reside in one place of it as in a closed cubicle: in that way he would never have arrived at the measurement and contemplation of the so distant stars, unless he had been furnished with more than human gifts; or rather since he was furnished with the eyes which he now has and with the faculties of his mind, it was his office to move around in this very spacious edifice by means of the transportation of the Earth his home and to get to know the different stations, according as they are measurers — *i.e.*, to take a promenade — so that he could all the more correctly view and measure the single parts of his house. Now you understand that — in order that the first part of this *Book IV* might be fitted properly together — its writer needed to have the Earth a ship and its annual voyage around the Sun. But if the Earth moves, the Sun is necessarily at rest.

## 6. On the Diurnal Revolution of the Terrestrial Body Around its Axis and its Effect in Moving the Moon, and on the Mutual Proportions of the Year, Month, and Day

**Because, in addition to the annual revolution around the Sun, the diurnal rotation too is assigned to the Earth, which is one of the primary planets: I ask, you do not believe, do you, that all the primary planets turn in this way around their axes?**

That is very probable, firstly in the case of Venus, as being seen to exhibit one spot after another — taking as a sign its sparkling, which is of a different form from the sparkling of the fixed stars; again in the case of Jupiter, as bearing four satellites; and Saturn, which bears two just as the Earth bears one, the aforesaid Moon: concerning which satellites below.

**By what principles is this rotation of bodies around their axes brought to pass?**

In *Book I*, which concerns the Earth, and in this *Book IV*, which concerns the Sun, it has been said that these bodies are turned by an inborn animal principle or something similar. But that this principle is not alone in rotating the Earth but is assisted by the Sun is gathered from two pieces of evidence: first, because the number of daily revolutions of the Earth in a year, which is 365 3/4, exceeds the proximate archetype, which is 360. For it is fitting that, unless the internal motor force of the Earth were nourished by the perpetual presence of the Sun, the Earth would have moved along somewhat more slowly around its axis; and thus in the same space of a year it would have made fewer revolutions, namely only 360. With this postulated, it follows that the 5 3/4 remaining and as it were supernumerary revolutions are added to those 360 on account of some assistance from the Sun. The other piece of evidence names this circumstance: that that part of the difference of time which the preceding *Books I* and *III*, folia 108 and 286, spoke of, and which Tycho Brahe is seen to have brought to light by clear experiments with eclipses, and which I reduced to physical form, is relevant here. For because this additosubtractive difference of time puts the summer revolution of the Earth as slightly slower than the winter: that indeed could not come from an inborn principle in the Earth, as such principles are wont to be perpetually uniform; but it must come from the intervals between the Sun and the Earth, which in our hemisphere are longer in the summer than in the winter.

**Perhaps every force causing this whirling movement is in the Sun alone, none in any principle of movement inborn separately in the Earth?**

This is repugnant to both of the aforesaid reasons. For (1) if the number 365 3/4 were not composed of the two effects of two distinct causes, there would be no reason why it is not one of the archetypal numbers, that is, one of the round numbers rather than one of the disjoined and ignoble fractions. (2) If the true physical additosubtractive difference of time is postulated: then, if the Sun causes everything, the whole diurnal revolutions of the Earth would be proportional to the intervals between the Sun and the Earth. But the magnitude of this additosubtractive difference of time demands that not the whole revolutions but merely some small parts of the revolutions should be proportional to these variable intervals.

**Reckon the internal virtue of the Earth at 360 revolutions in one year; what reason for this number do you know from the archetype?**

Because the Sun had to cover the 720th part of its circle or apparent course at its farthest distance from the Earth; I believe that such great strength has been united to this virtue of the whirling movement, that the Sun in any revolution of the Earth could appear to have progressed through two such small parts of its circle — according to the number of the two parts of the revolution, of which one part is called day, and the other is called night — to the view from any one place on the surface of the Earth. Consequently if two spaces of the ecliptic are stamped by the portions of the Sun on two successive noons, there would be intercepted an empty or unstamped space equal to either of them; and as day is to night, so would the space filled by the Sun be to the empty space — the diurnal space around the centre of the Sun to the nocturnal space. For in all these things, the nature of man, the observer creature and future dweller on the Earth, was taken up among the archetypal causes — as being one who was going to reckon the magnitude of the solar body and contemplate the difference of day and night.

**But if this had been sought, it seems that it would also have been obtained? But you yourself admit that those ratios have been disturbed, since on account of those further increments from the Sun the 360 days have become 365 3/4 and thus the diurnal journeys have become shorter.**

1.  It cannot be said that this was sought simply, but merely in the adjustment of the principle of internal movement in the Earth; and in that manner it was obtained. 2. But even if in this secondary movement the concourse of causes disturbs the number instituted; still this disturbance was not so great but that during the months of November and January this magnitude is obtained; because then the magnitude of the diurnal movement of the Sun is or twice 30'. Long before, even if there were no such disturbance, the magnitude of the diurnal movement of the Sun would have been such only twice during the year, on account of the necessary irregularity of the apparent movement of the Sun.

**How does the Sun strengthen the motor virtue of the Earth by increasing the speed of the diurnal revolution of the Earth?**

It is very probable that this takes place by the mediation of the light of the Sun (*mediante solis lumine*), which the Sun pours upon the Earth, through the illumination of the Earth's hemisphere. For because the physical additosubtractive difference of time demands unequal daily revolutions of the Earth, according as its distance from the Sun varies; certainly at a short interval the illumination is strong as coming from a denser light; and weaker at a long distance, as from a thinner and thus lesser light; and that occurs — as regards the one dimension of longitude, into which the movement proceeds — in the very ratio of the distances. And so the amount of light which there is at any given time is fitted, by means of the distances, for distributing this acceleration throughout the year.

**What are the effects of the daily revolution of the Earth, and, in general, of the revolutions of the primary bodies around their axes?**

Two: the first, which is proper to the Earth, is that for us who dwell on the Earth, all the stars in the heavens, both the fixed and the wandering, and so also the Sun and the Moon are seen every day to rise in the east and set in the west; although with respect to this diurnal movement they remain fixed in their places. I have treated of this deceptive appearance in the *first three books on the doctrine of the sphere*. The other effect, which is physical and most true and is common to all the primary bodies, and hence to the Sun, is that the primary planets, by means of the form departed from their body set in revolution, move their secondary planets — as the Earth, the Moon — and cause the secondary planets to move in the same direction but more slowly, and as if left behind.

**By what arguments is it made probable that the primary planets share their own movements around themselves with the secondary planets, and especially the Earth with the Moon?**

The Moon and Earth give the first evidence. For, just as above, from the fact that the planets, on drawing near to the Sun, are borne more speedily, we reasoned that the Sun by means of the form from its body, *i.e.*, its form set in rotation, moves the planets around itself in the same direction; so also, because we find that (1) in so far as the Moon draws nearer to the Earth — but not to the Sun — so much the more speedily does it move around the Earth, and (2) in the same direction in which the Earth revolves around its axis; it is with the greatest probability that we derive that movement of the Moon from the whirling of the Earth; and that is all the more probable, because (3) there is also the correspondence that, just as the rotation of the Sun around its axis is shorter than the shortest period of Mercury, so too the Earth rotates approximately thirty times, before the Moon has one restitution. For if the Moon revolved more quickly than the Earth, its movement could not wholly come from the rotation of the Earth. (4) But belief in this thing is confirmed by the comparison of the four satellites of Jupiter and Jupiter with the six planets and the Sun. For even if in the case of the body of Jupiter we do not have the evidence as to whether it rotates around its axis, which we do have in the case of the terrestrial body and the solar body in particular, that is to say, evidence from sense-perception, but sense-perception testifies that exactly as it is with the six planets around the Sun, so too is the case with the four satellites of Jupiter: in such fashion that the farther any satellite can digress from Jupiter, the more slowly does it make its return around the body of Jupiter. And that indeed does not occur in the same ratio but in a greater, that is, in the ratio of the power of the distance of each planet from Jupiter: and that is exactly the same as the ratio which we found above among the six planets. For Marius in his *World of Jupiter* reports that the distances of the four Jovial satellites from Jupiter are as follows: 3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 according to Galileo): as if their 'small spheres' were separated by the three rhomboidal [solids]: (I) the rhomboidal dodecahedron between the innermost, whose intervals are 3 and 5; (II) the rhomboidal triacontahedron between the middle spheres, whose intervals are 5 and 8; and (III) the cube, which is not rhomboidal, but is a beginning of the rhomboidal solids, between the extremes, which have the intervals 8 and 13 (or 14). Now the same Marius reports the periodic times as follows: 1 day 18 1/2 hours; 3 days 13 1/3 hours; 7 days 2 hours; 16 days 18 hours; everywhere the ratio is greater than double, and is accordingly greater than the ratio of the intervals 3, 5, 8, 13, or 14, but smaller than that of the squares, which constitute the ratios of the 2nd powers of the intervals, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196; just as also the 3rd powers are greater than the 1st powers, but smaller than the 2nd powers.

Therefore since the agreement of the Jovial satellites with the six primary planets is so exact, not only did we rightly infer above from this that the body of Jupiter turns around its axis like the Sun so that the proportion holds for all its members; but here already, over and above that, we are confirming not improperly the general statement that this rotation of the primary bodies around their axes is the cause of the circuit of the secondary bodies around the primary bodies. That is so much the more probable because we see that, just as the Sun is greater than all the planets which it moves, so too the Earth is much greater than its Moon, and Jupiter than its satellites, and for that reason, like the Sun, fit for moving them. The remaining probabilities have to do with the Moon again. For that the bodies of the Moon and Earth are akin is taught us by the telescope, which reveals signs in the Moon of mountains and of seas, such as they are in our globe of the Earth. Even Aristotle, elsewhere a very sharp defender of the fifth essence of the heavens, recognized this kinship, and, according to Averroës, he said that the Moon seemed to be a certain ethereal Earth. I am silent as to Plutarch and the other philosophers in Macrobius.

Accordingly, just as the kinship of their bodies makes the loadstone attract loadstone or iron; so also in the case of the Moon it is not unbelievable that it should be moved by the terrestrial body which is akin, although neither in that case nor in this case is there any contact between the bodies. And furthermore (7) why is it surprising that the Moon should be moved by the Earth, since we see that in turn the Moon also, by its passing above the vertices of places, causes the ebb and flow of the ocean on the Earth? Is not this a clear enough evidence of the sharing of movement by these two bodies? Finally (8) the same thing is confirmed by the remaining part of the proportion: the Sun and Earth wheel around their axes, as experience makes us certain — in the case of the Sun of itself (*per se*), in the case of the Moon, only in Copernicus — namely in order that by this rotation they may give movement to the planets placed around them — the Sun to the six primary planets, and the Earth to the Moon: that the Moon in turn does not wheel around the axis of its own body is argued by the spots. But why is this so? If not because no further planet is seen to go around the Moon. Accordingly the Moon has no planet to which it gives movement by the rotation of its body. Accordingly, in the Moon, the rotation was left out, as being superfluous.

If these eight arguments are not of use as taken singly, they will be of service as taken together.

**But does it not seem absurd that the Earth, which lacks light, should be compared as an equal with the Sun, the source of light? For does not this quality make the motor force of the Sun more probable?**

Even if the light (*lumen*) of the Sun works itself up in supplying movement, nevertheless the body of the Sun is not potent in motor force on account of the light alone. For there is nothing to prevent two, so to speak, subjects of motor virtue from being found together in the Sun — light and the bodily affection of magnetism — and only the latter of them being present in the Earth; just because the Earth moves only one planet, and that a very ignoble one — as one of the secondary planets. Nor does the magnetic virtue of the Earth alone move it without any assistance, as we hear; nor does the Earth have this force wholly *from* itself, though the force is in the Earth; but the Earth seems to have partly drawn off this force as by a certain canal by the continuation of the line from the Sun into itself and especially in the illumination of its body, and it seems to have turned aside this force into a new source, namely into its own body — as was said a little while before, and will be said more clearly below.

**The rotation of the Earth keeps to the equatorial circle; but the movement of the Moon, to the Zodiac, which has a great declination from the equator. Therefore it is not probable, is it, that the movement of the Moon comes from the rotation of the Earth?**

This does not bother us any more in the case of the Moon than in that of the other planets. For even if they have a declination towards certain regions of their own and, so to speak, hold the rudder in their hands and turn at their judgment and sail sideways or towards the banks of the river, none the less they are seized by the force of the common whirlpool of motion flowing out from the Sun; and so they have the movement of the common river to thank even for the distinct movement of their own, just as the Moon has the direct movement of the Earth along the equator to thank for its own oblique movement through the zodiac.

**Why therefore does the Moon keep its whole route along the zodiac rather than along the equator?**

Because in addition to the proper circuit of the Moon around the terrestrial globe — concerning which up to now — the whole heaven of the Moon is also moved in the movement shared with the centre of the Earth along the zodiac around the Sun, like the other planets. And it comes about from the composition [of these movements] that with respect to the centre of the Sun the Moon always holds to a direct course eastward not only at the time when the Sun and the Earth, with their distances from the Moon overlapping, hurry the full Moon into the same region, but also at the time when the Sun impels the dark or void Moon forward, while the Earth — with respect to the centre of the Sun — impels it backward. For this impulse from the Earth is still much less than that from the Sun: wherefore it diminishes the movement’s bearing eastward, but does not wholly absorb it, much less turn it in the contrary direction. See the diagram of this composite movement of the Moon in the *Commentaries on Mars*, folium 149.

Therefore since that flow of the solar form advancing along the zodiac is greater, and is other than the terrestrial form, which, proceeding along the equator, is less; and moreover since when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction, by reason of the speed and the region of rising and setting, in the space of the world more is in obedience to the Sun than to the Earth: I believe that hence it comes about that by reasons of the latitudinal regions too, the Moon is more obedient to the solar form as the stronger — as its whole heaven around the Sun, so also its body around the Earth — and is compelled to advance along the zodiac or to regulate according to the zodiac its own orbit around the Earth.

**From this does not anomaly arise in the lunar movement, if the Moon at the tropic points advances according to the lead of the terrestrial form, because the zodiac and the equator are parallel at those points, but at the equinoctial points it crosses obliquely this form from the terrestrial body?**

Again, in order to solve this objection, I make the same answer as in the case of the latitudes. Namely, that the form from the terrestrial body is very strong in its midpart under the equator, but is weaker to the sides of the equator; because even at the source, namely in the terrestrial globe, the circles parallel to the equator, as being smaller, are set in motion more slowly than the equator, the great circle. Accordingly a balancing takes place: so that where the Moon experiences a strong motor form, there it does not comply with the whole form but goes off crosswise — and where it complies with the whole form and is utterly obedient to it, there the Moon experiences it weak. Notwithstanding, I do not proclaim anything concerning the balancing in all its respects, since lunar observations still disagree in very small amounts from any given calculations, and since it is uncertain to what that discrepancy should be referred.

**How too can the Moon be borne around the Sun in an annual movement, but the four satellites around Jupiter in a common duodecennial movement, so that mean-**

while neither does the moon abandon or let go of the Earth nor the four Jovian satellites Jupiter, if the moon is not bound by a solid sphere to the Earth, and they to Jupiter?

Now the secondary planets are borne around the sun by the same virtue of the solar form, whereby also their primary planets, the Earth and Jupiter, are borne; but they would revolve more speedily than their primary planets, inasmuch as they are readier for movement by reason of their density, bulk, or weight, if they were not held back and laid hold of by the Earth and Jupiter by means of a magnetic force similar to that with which the sun too is endowed. But this prehensive force, as was said above concerning the planets
too, is determined by the contrary virtues of the approach and withdrawal of the moon from the Earth; for as the Earth revolves around its axis, by this laying hold it makes the moon revolve but meanwhile changes the region of its own body with respect to which approach and withdrawal takes place. See the diagram on page 899. Imagine the friendly region (*plagam amicam*) of the lunar globe to be turned towards the Earth and not to be changed about with the contrary region. Imagine also that the Earth does not rotate around its axis, but is nevertheless borne around the sun: in this case the moon will run the same course as the Earth, and meanwhile it will be attracted by the Earth, until it comes into contact with it. In turn imagine the same thing concerning the unfriendly region: in this case the moon will flee the Earth until it gets outside of the sphere of magnetic virtue of the Earth: then it will wholly give itself up to seizure by the sun alone, and thus will wander completely away from the Earth.

You have said that the middle circle of the Earth is slightly less than sixty times narrower than the sphere of the moon. But this same circle of the Earth is only thirty times faster than the moon because the moon returns in 29.5 days. Therefore the circle of the Earth is slower than the centre of the moon around the Earth in the ratio of two to one. How then does a body, which proceeds more slowly, give to the moon a movement twice as great and twice as fast as its own movement?

This objection does not apply uniquely to lunar movement, but generally to all the planets; and there is nothing absurd in it. For the solar and terrestrial bodies do not move [things] by contact, but by the spreading out or unfolding of their forms into every orbit of the movable body. Now in so far as the form from the terrestrial body flows out through space, it turns with the Earth, its source, in the same time of 24 hours, since nevertheless in that place where it lays hold of the moon, it is of the same amplitude as the sphere of the moon. Therefore that form, sixty times wider than the Earth, passes through the total orbit of the moon thirty times in one month, although within the same interval the moon, following after the form from the Earth, has only one periodic return. And so it remains probable that the movement of that form from the terrestrial body moves the moon; but in such a way nevertheless that the inertia of the lunar body overcomes diurnally about 29 parts of the expanse of virtue and is overcome with respect to not more than the thirtieth.

Why do you set down that the sun concurs with the motor form of the Earth even in that movement whereby the moon revolves around the Earth?

1. Because Tycho Brahe found that the mean movement of the moon—that is, without the anomaly which exists in all planets on account of the eccentricity of the orbit—still has an anomaly or is irregular. For the moon is always speedier in the syzygies, as here in CD and GH, and slower in the quadratures EF and IK than the ratio of eccentricity accounts for—whether in either case it is in the apogee or in the perigee or in any other position on its eccentric circle; and—if we are to insist firmly upon Tycho's hypothesis for the said variation—the moon is exactly as much faster in the syzygies as it is slower in the quadratures.

But the form itself from the Earth—the form set in rotation and to be understood by the circle DFHK—is of uniform speed all around, as much
in those parts which are turning at the syzygies D and H as in those parts which are turning at the quadratures F and K—that is to say, for one and the same interval between the moon and the Earth. Accordingly other causes of movement which may be adjusted to the phases of the moon must be added to this motor form. But the phases of the moon are caused by the sun. Therefore the sun assists the movement of the moon around the Earth.

2. Belief in this concurrence of the sun is strengthened by the fact that before this, on pages 917 and 918, the same sun was summoned in order to aid the speed of the Earth in revolving, by the illumination of the [terrestrial globe]—here represented by the middle circle AB. For from this, as in the example of the Earth, we first understood that even in the light of the sun there is present a power of quickening movement. Then from the same thing we weave a necessary argument even for the moon. For if, according as DFHK the form from the terrestrial body is set in whirling motion, it moves the moon; but the sun accelerates this whirling motion: therefore the sun will accelerate the moon too by means of the Earth and the acceleration of its form.

Then this illumination is not disposed in one way when the moon is turning in the quadratures F and K, and in another way when the moon is turning in the syzygies D and H?

By no means. For in both cases the halves of the globes are illuminated, both of the Earth AB, which gives movement, and of the moon CD or GH, to which movement is given. Rather, it has already been said that the speed of the Earth from this illumination is equal at both times.

Whence then does this disparity of effect come to this accessory cause, so that it accelerates the movement of the moon very much in the syzygies D and H but not at all in the quadratures F and K? And what on the contrary slows the movement of the moon in the quadratures F and K?

No part of celestial physics was more difficult to explain than this. And in order to straighten things out, where possible, we must make use of the diagram on this page.

Accordingly you remember that all the circles which bound the illumination of the lunar globe, as CD and GH, were parts of the same number of spherical surfaces, into which the light coming from the sun as from a centre is spread out; while the circle DFHK represents the form of the terrestrial body AB at the centre of its position, and this form moves the moon. You see that in the syzygies D and H the form from the light CD and the form from the terrestrial body OCDL are joined to one another by contact (*invicem applicari per contactum*), and that at L, M, N, and O they cut one another at oblique angles, so that the joining (*applicatio*) is more incomplete. But in the quadratures EF and IK the cutting is at right angles; therefore there is clearly no joining, since the section of the moon stretches towards the centre of the Earth and a mere point on the circle NIO corresponds to it.

Therefore, since no other cause for the acceleration in the syzygies is apparent, we shall have to set down that a faculty strengthening the terrestrial motor form ODL is present in the light CD separately, not now in so far as the source of the light, i.e., the solar body, is rotated—this modification given by the movement was valid above, since we were speaking of the forms of the solar and terrestrial bodies without any reference to light—but *qua* light: indeed, in accordance with the true and somehow essential configuration of light. Then if we set down that this form from the terrestrial body is strengthened through the modes of its joining to the circles (*orbes*) of light; we shall have at hand the cause and the measure of there being a very strong acceleration in the syzygies CD and GH, but none in the quadratures.

But since by DFHK is represented not merely the form of the terrestrial body as agent or mover, but also the very orbit of the moon as of the patient or thing moved—although at that time the Earth must not be placed at the centre of the circle but near by—we must conceive further either that at the syzygies CD and GH the lunar body is better disposed towards movement according to the diffusion or the surface of the light than in EF and IK, where the moon cuts the circles of diffusion crosswise, or that the road of the moon in D and H is made as it were slippery, but rough in F and K—as on a table with grooves running crosswise in the wood. And that is not very absurd. For since the power of strengthening the movement is present in the light, as it was laid down; surely where one dimension of the light stretches, it is likely that the passage is easy.

Furthermore, as regards the effect, the same thing is said by him who says that the moon is accelerated in D and H and slowed up in F and K and in both cases in the simple ratio which these joinings (*applicationes*) produce, and by him who says that the moon is very greatly accelerated in D and H and none at all in F and IK, but in the ratio of the squares of that which results from the joinings posited here.

Unless anyone prefers to ascribe this twofold efficacy of the light to the two dimensions of the surface of the light; so that, although any immaterial forms of bodies are diffused no less than light is diffused both in longitude and in latitude; nevertheless those forms up to now have been effectual only with reference to longitude; but this [light] is effectual with reference both to longitude and latitude: on account of the fact that the form moves as moved; but it is moved only in longitude; while light strengthens as light, i.e., according as it possesses its own density, both in longitude and in latitude.

Why do you attribute the force to strengthen the motor cause to the light separately and outside of its reference to the rotation of its source?

Because in so far as the form from the rotating source moves [the moon], it always moves it eastward in the direction CIDL; and in the beginning of this section we already finished with its effect in moving the moon. But this force from the light is potent in accelerating the moon even westward
in the direction MNH, with reference to the centre of the sun, at that time namely when the moon appears to us to be void of light or in conjunction with the sun. Therefore the light does not by itself bring movement and direction together (*conciliat motui plagam*), but by means of the acceleration of the form MHN.

If this force is present in light, greater force will be present in the denser light around GH, as being in the neighbourhood of the sun; a lesser in the more scattered light, around the full moon in CD, since it is farther away from the sun by a thirtieth part of the distance: therefore the new moon will be speedier than the full, other things being equal.

The more perfect joining balances the weakness of the light CD, as CD is of a more regular concavity than GH. Therefore since the strengthening takes place through the joining of the forms: in the full moon the more scattered light, joined more perfectly, accomplishes as much as in the new moon the denser light, joined more imperfectly, does. Now the intervals between the moon and the sun which measure out density to the light and which measure out the curvature to the circles DC and GH are the same: wherefore the density is perfectly balanced in longitude by the curves CD and GH. But the effect of the light on one side is balanced by the diversity of the joining on the other. For even though CD and GH are equally curved; nevertheless in the first case the convex OCDL winds into the concave CD; in the second case the convex MGHN is turned towards GH the form from light, which is convex towards the Earth.

If that addition of 133° to the 12 restitutions (*synodos*) in the sidereal year comes from the acceleration of the lunar movement in the syzygies, the magnitude of the acceleration must correspond too.

Indeed in Tycho Brahe the movement of the moon in the syzygies is accelerated only 1'26" per 1°, and is slowed 1'26" per 1° in the quadratures; wherefore if the slowing is effaced by the twofold acceleration, the greatest acceleration of the syzygies will be 2'52". Wherefore if the sines squared of all the 90° bring their small portions into one sum, we shall have as the aggregate 2°9'; therefore in the sidereal year 106°22' but not 132°45'.

But in the first place the magnitude of the greatest variation is not very certain in Tycho, who exhibits it as 40'30" at 45°; and so, if the variation is set down as 51', we equal the aforesaid sum—3'34"40''' being taken as the acceleration of 1°, or in Tycho's formulation 1'47"20''', and an equal slowing up at 90° or in the quadratures; and thus in one quadrant the sum of 2°41' is added up, and that sum will acquire great probability below, when we deal with the causes of the irregularities. Then if in particular we keep Tycho's small magnitude, at 45°; the preceding and the subsequent magnitudes, distributed in another formulation than Tycho's, could give the desired sum; or else there are hidden from us very minute causes, which take away something from the 133° in the treatment of the variation.

Then in what proportion do you think the monthly movement of the moon around the Earth should be distributed among those two causes, namely the form of the terrestrial body and the circle of illumination of the bodies?

We see that while the Earth revolves around its axis approximately 29.5 times, in the meantime the moon returns around the Earth once, namely
from sun to sun. So it happens that in one year or 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 26 seconds the moon returns twelve times and adds on more than one third of the thirteenth revolution, that is, 132°45'. Therefore it is likely that the density of matter in the lunar body is so proportioned to the archetypal degree of strength in the form from the terrestrial body, that unless illumination aided the daily revolution of the Earth and also by means of this [revolution] aided the progress of the moon, the moon itself by reason of the simple motor virtue of the Earth would return slightly more slowly, that is to say, exactly twelve times. With this laid down, it follows that those remaining and as it were supernumerary 132°45' of the incomplete thirteenth revolution must be attributed to the other motor cause, namely the illumination.

Then you evaluate the density of the lunar body as proportioned to twelve lunar revolutions in one year: what will you say is the archetypal cause of this number?

The cause seems to be composite of geometrical beauty and of the office of this planet in the world: as follows: For the moon is a secondary planet assigned to the Earth, and it keeps to its own private course around the Earth. But 360 revolutions were allotted to the Earth, while the centre of the Earth makes one return around the sun. Then, just as among the upper planets, the sphere of the moon had to be a mean proportional between the body of the Earth and the sphere wherein the centre of the Earth really revolves, but the sun apparently; so also the revolutions of the moon had to be more than one but fewer than 360. And indeed the mean proportional between 1 and 361 is 19; but because the number 361 is not 360 and because 19 does not have any beauty either geometrical or harmonical; then the two numbers nearest to 19, which when multiplied together, give 360 and are the most beautiful geometrically and harmonically, should be chosen. Now the nearest numbers which give 360 are 18 and 20, because the first is smaller by unity alone, and the second greater than 19 by unity alone. But there is no demonstration of a figure of 18 sides. The numbers following nearest are 15 and 24, which also give 360. Now there are geometrical demonstrations of them, but rather worthless ones; nor do they give any outstanding ratio, but only the ratio between 5 and 8; nor are they the most excellent and first of all in harmonics. But the numbers 12 and 30—for there are no others nearer which give 360—excel in all ways: both geometrically, as being generated from the first figures inscribed in the circle, and harmonically, because all harmonies are represented by these two divisions of the string. Then of the numbers which, when multiplied together, give 360, there are none more beautiful.

Furthermore, a number [not] less than 12 and not greater than 30 was due to the revolutions of the moon; because the sphere of the moon exhibits an image of the sphere of the sun, it was fitting too that, just as the year, which is the periodic time of the sun, is divided into 360, a great multitude, so also the month, which is the periodic time of the moon, should be allotted parts or days greater in number than all the months in the year; and that the multitude should increase with the progress, if in the first place the year, the long time, were divided into 12 months, the big parts, and thence the month, the short time, into 30 days, the little parts; for multitude is becoming to small things.
And it would not have been of the same beauty, if there had been thirty months in the year, and each month had been of twelve days.

How do you make it probable that the increase in the annual revolutions of the Earth above the number 360 and this addition to the annual movement of the moon beyond the twelve monthly revolutions of the moon come from the same cause?

The very reasons of this philosophy bear witness to this thing; so that, because the daily rotation of the terrestrial globe moves the moon, the greater in number and speedier the rotations are, they move the moon with greater speed, and make it return more often. And especially so does the comparison of the number of days in the solar year—365 days 6 hours and a little more—with the archetypal number 360 and with the number of days in the lunar year—354 days and a little less than 9 hours.

For since 360 days in the year—making the moon revolve 12 times—should have come from the archetype, but they have become 365 by the intervention of the other cause; accordingly all the revolutions have become faster in the ratio of 360 to 365, and in that ratio stronger with respect to moving the moon. But at the same time they have become greater in number, i.e., 365. Therefore the faculty of the 360 archetypal revolutions should be evaluated at the number 360. But the faculty of these actual 365 revolutions should be evaluated not at the number 365, because these revolutions are faster, but at the number which is a third proportional, namely 370°36'50"—if we attend to the minutiae. But if the faculty stamped with the number 360 would have moved the moon so that it would have completed 12 returns with respect to the sun and would have ended the last of those returns at its initial position beneath the fixed stars: therefore, in the same proportion, the faculty evaluated at the number 370°36'50'' will make the moon outrun the sun 12 times and go 127°10' beyond its initial position: and because, after the 360 days which were in the archetype have been completed, the sun is still 5°10' distant from its initial position beneath the fixed stars, and because the circle, which in the archetype had been divided among the 12 positions of the full moons, has been narrowed by that interval, accordingly the addition of these 5°10' to those 127°10' makes 132°20'. See how near this reasoning comes to the truth in the astronomical tables; for they give the excess of the moon in the sidereal year as 132°45', only 25' more.

We will also infer the same thing from the days of the lunar year, as follows: The motor faculty of the 360 revolutions of the Earth would have given the moon its twelfth return with respect to the sun and to its initial position; therefore the faculty of revolutions fewer in number but so much the stronger will accomplish just as much. Accordingly as 365 revolutions is to 360, so the faculty of the 360 archetypal days is to the faculty of the 354 actual days and 19 hours, 33 minutes. Therefore so many terrestrial revolutions, now become more intense, would have given the moon its twelfth return with respect to the sun, if only the intervals between two syzygies had not been contracted by the increase in the number of the revolutions. But because, with the insertion of the supernumerary days in the year, the 360th day as archetypal breaks up the measure of contraction of the zodiac, from which 5°6'41" are due proportionally to the length of the lunar year; accordingly the moon too is relieved (*sublevatur*) of the same number of degrees; so that even when those degrees have not been
traversed in the expanse of the world, nevertheless the moon makes its twelfth return with respect to the sun. Now those degrees are equivalent to 10 hours 4 minutes. And when 10 hours 4 minutes have been subtracted from 19 hours 33 minutes which were found, 9 hours 29 minutes remain in addition to the 354 days. Instead of these 9 hours 29 minutes the astronomical tables give 8 hours 49 minutes, so that less than an hour is missing. And that small difference can be assigned to other minute circumstances. Meanwhile it has been proved exactly enough in both ways that this straying from the whole and beautiful numbers is due to the concurrence of the causes of the lunar movement. And the reason is clear why 360 is approximately a mean proportional between the lengths of the lunar year and the solar sidereal year.

## PART III
### On the Real and True Irregularity of the Planets and its Causes

From what do the planets have that name which signifies wanderers in this language?

From the manifold variety of their proper movements. For if you follow the judgment of the eyes, that variety has no law, no determined circle, no definite time, if a comparison is made with the fixed stars.

In how many ways do the planets seem to wander?

In three ways: (1) In the longitude of the sphere of the fixed stars, which we said extends along the ecliptic. (2) In latitude or to the two sides of the ecliptic, towards its poles. (3) In altitude, i.e., in the straight line stretching from the centre of vision into the depth of the ether. Nevertheless this variety is not uncovered by the eyes alone; but reasoning from the diverse apparent magnitude of the bodies and the arcs assents to it.

What must be held concerning these wanderings of the planets? Do they really wander in so many various ways, or is sight merely deceived?

Even though that movement is not wholly such as meets the eyes, it is present in the planetary bodies themselves; but much deception of sight winds its way in here. Nevertheless when these deceptions have been removed by the mind, some irregularity of movements still remains and is really present in all the planets.

Then what is that true movement of the planets through their surroundings?

It is constant with respect to the whole periods; and proceeds around the sun, the centre of the world, always eastward towards the signs which follow. It never sticks in one place, as though stationary, and much less does it ever retrograde. But nevertheless it is of irregular speed in its parts; and it makes the planet in one fixed part of its circuit digress rather far from the sun, and in the opposite part come very near to the sun: and so the farther it digresses, the slower it is; and the nearer it approaches, the faster it is. Finally, in one part of the circle it departs from the ecliptic to the north, and in the other, to the south. And so the planet is left with a real irregularity and one which is threefold, too: in longitude, in latitude and in altitude. The astronomers prove that by suitable evidence—concerning which in Book VI.

### 1. The Causes of the True Irregularities

State what the ancients thought about the causes of this irregularity.

The ancients wished it to be the office of the astronomer to bring forward such causes of this apparent irregularity as would bear witness that the true movement of the planet or spheres is most regular, most equal, and most constant, and also of the most simple figure, that is, exactly circular. And they judged that you should not listen to him who laid down that there was actually any irregularity at all in the real movements of these bodies.

Do you judge that this axiom should be kept?

I make a threefold answer: I. That the movements of the planets are regular, that is, ordered and described according to a fixed and immutable law is beyond controversy. For if this were not the case, astronomy would not exist, nor could the celestial movements be predicted. II. Therefore it follows that there is some conformity between the whole periods. For that law, of which I have spoken, is one and everlasting; the circuits or traversings of the celestial course are numberless. But if they all have the same law and rule, then all the circuits are similar to one another and equal in the passage of time.

III. But it has not yet been granted that the movement is really regular even in the diverse parts of any given circuit. (1) For astronomy bears witness that, if with our mind we remove all deceptions of sight from that confused appearance of the planetary motion, the planet is left with such a circuit that in its different parts, which are really equal, the speed of the planet is irregular—just as there is apparent inequality in the angles at the sun which are equal with respect to time. And Ptolemy himself, by setting up different centres in accordance with the rule of movement of eccentrics and epicycles, makes those circles of his to move more swiftly at one time, and more slowly at another. (2) Finally, astronomy, if handled with the right subtlety, bears witness in this case that the routes or single circuits of the planets are not arranged exactly in a perfect circle but are ellipses.

But by what arguments did the ancients establish their opinion which is the opposite of yours?

By four arguments in especial: (1) From the nature of movable bodies. (2) From the nature of the motor virtue. (3) From the nature of the place in which the movement occurs. (4) From the perfection of the circle.

Will you state their argument from the nature of bodies?

They reasoned that those bodies are not composed of the elements, and so neither generation or corruption nor alteration has any rights over them. The experience of all the ages bears witness to this: for the bodies are always

viewed as the same and are not found to have changed at all in mass or in number or in form. But the movements of the bodies made up of elements are for this very reason various and inconstant, because the elements are variously mixed in the constitution of the bodies and are at war with one another within the mixed bodies. Therefore in the celestial bodies, where there is no such mixture and no war of the elements as in mixed bodies, there is also no place for turbulence, none for irregularity.

What answer do you judge should be made to this argument?

If the argument is speaking of disordered turbulence of movements, there is none such in the heavens; there are no celestial disturbances as in thunderstorms.

Flame and drops of water at war with one another because the composition of the bodies of the world is of a very different family. But if the argument is in opposition to every regular irregularity also; then not every irregularity, certainly not that regular intensification and remission of movements, comes from the war of the elements mixed together in the moved bodies, nor from the bodies being mutable. For some irregularity arises just because they are bodies, bodies which are moved and which give movement too, and because they are made up of their own matter, their own magnitude, and their own figure both inwardly and outwardly, and in accordance with their magnitudes and figures they are endowed with their natural power too. And in accordance with their natural power they are less movable at a distance than at near-by, where the faculties of mover and moved are in agreement rather than at war. Thus by one part of its body the loadstone attracts iron, and by the other repels iron; not in either case on account of any mixture of elements, but on account of the inward rectilinear configuration, in accordance with which the loadstone has an inborn virtue. Thus the same loadstone attracts more strongly iron when near-by than when farther away—not that when the loadstone is nearer, it has more of fire or earth, but because its virtue is weakened with its distance. Nevertheless the celestial bodies—*i.e.*, the bodies of the world—remain everlasting and immutable as regards their total masses [*moles*]. For the changes which come about on their surfaces can bring on nothing sufficient to disturb [*nullum momentum ad turbandos*] the movements of the total masses [*molium*]. And upon this everlastingness of the whole globes and upon the fact that in the world there is nothing disordered which impedes their movements, there depend this regularity of the circlings, and the everlasting similarity, and the constant regularity, with respect to the whole cycles, of the irregularity in the single parts.

Will you review the second argument of the ancients taken from the mover cause?

They said, the motor virtues of the celestial bodies are of the most simple substance; they are minds divine and most pure, which do unceasingly what they do; they are everlastingly similar; they employ a most equal struggle of forces, and they are never tired, because they feel no labour. And so there is no reason why they should move their globes differently at different times. And accordingly even the figures of the movements, on account of the very nature of the minds, are most perfect circles.

What do you oppose to this?

Even though the motor virtue is neither some god nor a mind, nevertheless we must grant what the argument intends—chiefly too in the case of that motor cause which a truer philosophy brings in, namely in the case of the natural power of the bodies, because wherever and in so far as such a power is alone, it moves [a body] most regularly and in a perfect circle, and does that by the sole necessity of effort and by the everlasting simplicity of its essence. That is the case in the rotation of the solar body and in that of the Earth too in especial; for this rotation comes from one sole motor cause: whether it be a quality of the body or a sprout of the soul born with the body. For the axis with its two opposite poles stays fixed; but the body revolves around the axis most regularly and in a circle. This would be the case still, if any planetary globe were always at the same distance from the sun. For it would be carried by the sun with utmost regularity in a perfect circle, by means of the immaterial form released from the solar body set in a very regular movement of rotation. And by reason of this same very regular movement even that form from the body revolves in the amplitude of the expanse of the world, like a swift whirlpool.

But although so far we have granted the argument of the ancients, nevertheless regularity of movements in every respect does not yet follow from this. For not only do the motor virtue and the movable body come together in the movements, but also the inward rectilinear configuration of the movable body; and in proportion to its diversity of posture in relation to the sun, this configuration is affected in diverse ways in the movement: in one region it is repelled, in another it is attracted towards the inside. The axis of the magnetic movable body comes in, and so does being at rest in the parallel posture; and from that inward repose and from that revolution coming from outside there results that change of posture of the parts of the planet in relation to the sun. Finally there advenes the interval between the sun and the planet, and this interval varies with the attraction and repulsion. But when the interval has been changed and the planet comes into a denser or more rarefied virtue, then its movement too necessarily suffers intensification or remission, and the figure of its route becomes elliptical. So with reference to the concourse of so many required things, the virtue moving the planet cannot be called simple, because it moves by means of different degrees of its form.

What was the ancients' argument from place?

They considered that the region of the elements was around the centre of the world; the heavens at the surface. Therefore to the bodies made up of elements belongs rectilinear movement, which has a beginning and an end and which, disbursed according to the contrary principles of heaviness and lightness, brings any of those bodies back into its own place; and hence in proportion to different nearnesses to the natural place, or mark, there are different speeds, and finally pure rest. But the celestial bodies move everlastingly in the circular expanse of the world: and that argues that they are neither heavy nor light, and that they are not moved for the sake of rest or for the sake of occupying a place—for they are always circling in their place—but that accordingly they are moved only in order to be moved; and so their movement must be regular, and the form of their movement must be other than rectilinear, namely suited to an eternity of movement, that is, returning into itself.

What answer do you make to this third argument?

Not every irregularity of movements comes from heaviness and lightness, the properties of the elements; but some comes from the change of the distance too, as is clear in the case of the lever and the balance; and this cause produces intensification and remission of movements, as has been explained so far. We must however remark that there is nevertheless some kinship between the principles of heaviness and lightness in the elements and the natural inertia of the planetary globe with respect to movement, but no irregularity of movement is explained by this kinship.

But as regards the figure of the movement, the argument concludes nothing more than we can grant, namely that the movement bends back into itself. And not only the circular but also the elliptical are of such a kind; and so the assumptions are not denied. For in truth bodies which revolve around their axes are moved only in order that by their everlasting motion they may obey some necessity of their own globe—some bodies indeed in order that they may carry the planets around themselves in everlasting circles.

State the fourth argument of the ancients which was taken from the circular figure.

They philosophized that of all movements which return into themselves the circular is the most simple and the most perfect and that something of straightness is mixed in with all the others, such as the oval and similar figures: accordingly this circular movement is most akin to the very simple nature of the bodies, to the motors, which are divine minds—for its beauty and perfection is somehow of the mind—and finally to the heavens, which have a spherical figure.

How must this be refuted?

To this I make answer as follows: Firstly, if the celestial movements were the work of mind, as the ancients believed, then the conclusion that the routes of the planets are perfectly circular would be plausible. For then the form of movement conceived by the mind would be to the virtue a rule and mark to which the movement would be referred. But the celestial movements are not the work of mind but of nature, that is, of the natural power of the bodies, or else a work of the soul acting uniformly in accordance with those bodily powers; and that is not proved by anything more validly than by the observation of the astronomers, who, after rightfully removing the deceptions of sight, find that the elliptical figure of revolution is left in the real and very true movement of the planet; and the ellipse bears witness to the natural bodily power and to the emanation and magnitude of its form.

Then, even if we grant them their intelligences, nevertheless they do not yet obtain what they want, namely the complete perfection of the circle. For if it were a question only of the beauty of the circle, the circle would very rightly be decided upon by mind and would be suitable for any bodies whatsoever and especially the celestial, as bodies are partakers of magnitude, and the circle is the most beautiful magnitude. But because in addition to mind there was then need of natural and animal faculties also for the sake of movement; those faculties followed their own bent [*ingenium*], nor did they do everything from the dictate of mind, which they did not perceive, but they did many things from material necessity. So it is not surprising if those faculties, which are mingled together, could not attain perfection completely. The ancients themselves admit that the routes of the planets are eccentric, which seems to be a much greater deformity than the ellipse. And nevertheless they could not guard against this deformity by means of the province of those minds of theirs.

Now I have often reminded you that while I deny that the celestial movements are the work of mind, I am not at that moment speaking of the Creator's Mind, which all things indeed befit, whether circular or elliptical, whether administered and represented by minds or compelled by material necessity from the beginnings once laid down.

## 2. On the Causes of Irregularity in Longitude

Then what causes do you bring forward as to why, although all the routes of the primary planets are arranged around the sun, nevertheless the angles—in which as if from the centre of the sun, the different parts of the route of one planet are viewed—are not completed by the planet in proportional times?

Two causes concur, the one optical, the other physical, and each of almost equal effect. The first cause is that the route of the planet is not described around the sun at an equal distance everywhere; but one part of it is near the sun, and the opposite part is so much the farther away from the sun. But of equal things, the near are viewed at a greater angle, and the far away, at a smaller; and of those which are viewed at an equal angle, the near are smaller, and the far away are greater.

The other cause is that the planet is really slower at its greater distance from the sun, and faster at its lesser.

Therefore if the two causes are made into one, it is quite clear that of two arcs which are equal to sight, the greater time belongs to the arc which is greater in itself, and a much greater time on account of the real slowness of the planet in that farther arc.

But could not one cause suffice, so that, because generally the orbit of the planet draws as far away from the sun on one side as it draws near on the other, we might make such a great distance that all this apparent irregularity might be explained merely by this unequal distance of the parts of the orbit?

Observations do not allow us to make the inequality of the distances as great as the inequality of the time wherein the planet makes equal angles at the sun; but they bear witness that the inequality of the distances is sufficient to explain merely half of this irregularity: therefore the remainder comes from the real acceleration and slowing up of the planet.

What are the laws and the instances of this speed and slowness?

There is a genuine instance in the lever. For there, when the arms are in equilibrium, the ratio of the weights hanging from each arm is the inverse of the ratio of the arms. For a greater weight hung from the shorter arm makes a moment equal to the moment of the lesser weight which is hung from the longer arm. And so, as the short arm is to the long, so the weight on the longer arm is to the weight on the shorter arm. And if in our mind we remove the other arm, and if instead of the weight on it we conceive at the fulcrum an equal power to lift up the remaining arm with its weight; then it is apparent that this power at the fulcrum does not have so much might over a weight which is distant as it does over the same weight when near. So too astronomy bears witness concerning the planet that the sun does not have as much power to move it and to make it revolve when the planet is farther away from the sun in a straight line, as it does when the interval is decreased. And, in brief, if on the orbit of the planet you take arcs which are equally distant, the ratio between the distances of each arc from the sun is the same as the ratio of the times which the planet spends in those arcs. Thus let the centre of the sun or world be represented by the fulcrum of the lever, and its motor power by one arm and the weight on it—and we have already given the order to dissemble the arm and the weight, and mentally to reduce them to the fulcrum; but let the planet be represented by the weight on the remaining arm, and the interval between the sun and the planet, by the arm for that weight.

Let AC be the lever, D and B the weights hanging from C and A, FE the fulcrum, and FEC and FEA right angles. As CE is to EA, so is the weight B on EA to the weight D on EC. Remove mentally BA, and let the power formed through EA by the weight B be the power of the fulcrum E; accordingly this power of the fulcrum E will keep the weight D, hung from C, in horizontal equilibrium, that is, so that FEC will be a right angle. But if this same weight, pulled away from C, approaches as near as G, then the same power of E will have more might over this weight, and will lift it up above the line EC.

Now let E be not the fulcrum but the sun, and let D be the planet; and EC and EG the different distances of the planet from the sun. Accordingly observations bear witness that as EC is to EG, so is GK, the forward movement of the planet when nearer at G, to GI or CH, the forward movement of the planet when farther away at C.

Then do you attribute weight to the planet?

It was said in the above that we must consider that instead of weight there is that natural and material resistance or inertia with respect to leaving a place once occupied; and that this inertia snatches the planet as it were out of the hands of the rotating sun, so that the planet does not yield absolutely to that force which lays hold of it.

What is the reason why the sun does not lay hold of the planet with equal strength from far away and from near-by?

The weakening of the form from the solar body is greater in a longer outflow than in a shorter; and although this weakening occurs in the ratio of the squares of the intervals, *i.e.*, both in longitude and in latitude, nevertheless it works only in the simple ratio: the reasons have been stated above.

## 3. The Causes of the Irregularity in Altitude

But what pushes the planet out into more distant spaces and leads it back towards the sun?

The same which lays hold of the planet, the sun, namely, by means of the virtue of the form which has flowed out from its body throughout all the spaces of the world. For repulsion and attraction are as it were certain elements of this laying hold. For repulsion and attraction take place according to the lines of virtue going out from the centre of the sun; and since these lines revolve along with the sun, it is necessary for the planet too which is repelled and attracted to follow these lines in proportion to their strength in relation to the resistance of the planetary body. So the contrary movements of repulsion and attraction somehow compose this laying hold.

Do you attribute to the simple body of the sun and to its immaterial form the operations of attraction and repulsion which are contrary and so not simple?

The natural action or *energeia* of moving the planetary body for the sake of assimilation or of bringing it back to its primal posture is one [in number]; but it seems to be diverse on account of the diversity of the object. For only in one region is the planetary body in concord with the solar body; in the other region it is discordant. But it belongs to the same simple work to embrace like things and to spit out unlike things. This opinion is strengthened by the case of magnets; for though they are not celestial bodies, nevertheless they do not have that biform virtue from the composition of elements but from a simple bodily form.

Therefore the planetary body itself will be composed of contrary parts?

No, indeed. For it follows only that the planetary globe has an inward configuration of straight lines or threads, like magnetic threads, which happen to be terminated in contrary regions; and in one of these regions, not on account of the body itself but on account of its posture in relation to the sun, there reigns friendship [*familiaritas*] with the sun; and in the other region, discord.

But isn't it unbelievable that the celestial bodies should be certain huge magnets?

Then read the philosophy of magnetism of the Englishman William Gilbert; for in that book, although the author did not believe that the Earth moved among the stars, nevertheless he attributes a magnetic nature to it, by very many arguments, and he teaches that its magnetic threads or filaments extend in straight lines from south to north. Therefore it is by no means absurd or incredible that any one of the primary planets should be what one of the primary planets, namely the Earth, is.

Granted that the planet has an inward rectilinear magnetic configuration: then what is it that makes the planet turn one region of its body after another towards the sun? It does not turn its threads about, does it?

By no means: rather we should ask what it is which keeps the planetary body from removing its own magnetic axis from the posture which it has once taken with respect to the parts of the world, although nevertheless its body, like the terrestrial body, revolves around its axis and at the same time is moved out of its place and is transported in a circle around the sun. For out of this direction of the magnet towards the same region of the world during the whole circuit and out of the transportation of the body from place to place around the sun there is compounded, as out of two elements, the following effect: that the planetary globe changes the posture of its regions with respect to the sun. See the diagram on page 939.

What examples are there of this change?

Again there is a familiar example in the magnetic compass, namely where the iron needle has been magnetised. For into whatever place it may be transported, the compass needle always looks towards the north. And so if, carrying the compass, you march around some castle, then at one time the head and at another time the tail of the needle looks towards the castle, because in every part of its circuit the head always looks towards the north.

There was another astronomical example above in the third book, when we said that while the Earth revolves around the sun, the axis of terrestrial rotation remains in the same everlasting parallel posture—folium 248.

Then what causes do you assign for the pointing of the magnetic threads of the planetary body towards the same region of the world throughout the whole circuit of the planet?

The same as were indicated in Book I, folium 116[^1], by which the axis of terrestrial rotation is made steadfast. For firstly the parallel posture of the threads manifests a certain sameness, which is rest rather than motion. The cause of that does not seem to be any natural power which is positive or active, but rather one which is privative of all movement. And so that natural inertia of matter with respect to movement seems to have an inward rectilinear configuration and to be extended in accordance with these threads or to be rendered stronger and more unconquerable by the condensation of parts in a straight line.

But if this is not probable: then let there be [two] distinct *adynamiai* or powerlessnesses; the first belongs to all matter considered to be without inward configuration: and it enables the planet not to depart from its own place, unless it be drawn forth from the outside, namely by the sun. The second belongs to the planetary body according as it has a configuration of straight threads on the inside, and by reason of it these threads are kept safe so that they are not deflected by the revolution of the body or moved out of their posture. Finally the philosophizers are free to determine whether what I have just spoken of is merely an *adynamia* or a *dynamis*.

You define this *adynamia* or *dynamis* merely by the preservation of the posture. But what if something else were absent, and that *dynamis* looked towards some other fixed parts of the starry heavens?

In Book I, page 116, when it was a question of the axis of terrestrial rotation which is similarly immovable, an answer was given as to why such a thing should not be thought of: namely because there is no reason why the axis should point towards some empty point in the heavens rather than towards some star, and why in this direction rather than in that; and because these planetary threads, no less than the axis of terrestrial rotation above, are found in the succession of ages to swerve slightly and thus to desert their original stars of reference [*fixas pristinas*] and to slope towards other succeeding stars, as can be judged in general. For that movement is so very slow that within the 1400 years from Ptolemy to us this cannot be safely enough affirmed of all the planets.

Perhaps those axes of rotation of the bodies play the roles of the threads which you bring in here instead of librations?

The axis of the daily rotation of the Earth—of which I have spoken in the doctrine of spheres—forever points in longitude towards the beginnings of the Crab and of the Goat. For this axis prolonged in both directions marks out the poles of the world, as in Book II, page 150. But the arc drawn from the pole of the world perpendicular to the ecliptic passes also through the poles of the ecliptic: therefore it is the colure of the solstices and marks out the beginnings of the said signs.

But the threads by which the Earth is repelled from the sun or attracted pass from sign to sign. The aphelion of the Earth was formerly in the Archer, but now it is at 6° of the Goat. Therefore the axis of rotation of the Earth and the thread which changes the interval are different.

Then it seems that the Earth nevertheless should be at its greatest distance in the beginning of the Goat. For if the whole body of the Earth rotates around that axis, the thread will be rotated too, in so far as it differs in posture from the axis, and it will describe as it were two cones with their vertices meeting at the centre of the Earth, and only at one moment of the day will it look towards its proper place: during the rest of the day it will revolve around the beginning of the Goat pointed out by the axis of the Earth. And thus it will pile up all its own force at this axis, and by a certain as it were spiral line will draw the Earth away from the sun and always towards the region pointed at by the axis.

Certainly in this way, by the tight connection of the thread with the axis of daily movement, what is spoken of would take place, and the apsis of the Earth would never depart from the beginning of the Goat. Or else we are therefore compelled to admit that the globe is inside an outer crust: in such fashion that the crust rotates during the daily movement, while the globe having the threads does not rotate; and the ordinary magnetic virtue belongs to the outward crust, because it always shows the poles of daily rotation but not the apsis of the sun or Earth.

Whence let some physicist come to the help of J. C. Scaliger, who argues about the rising of rivers and the ebb and flow of the sea; and let the physicist see if these separated bowels of the Earth can aid him in his labour. Even though the moon and the soul of the Earth are sufficient for me.

[^1]: There are three possible causes. (1) Since the form of the turning is joined to the globe and is directed towards a definite region and not towards all indiscriminately, it follows with geometric necessity that the axis of this turning is directed constantly towards the lateral regions as long as the middle circle of the turning does not stray from its own region. (2) There is a privative cause of motion, namely the natural inertia of the matter of the globe, due to the dragging of the axis, which necessitates force to turn it aside from its position; since, however, no power of motion is brought to bear against it, it remains at rest in its position. (3) There is an internal, positive, natural power in the rectilinear threads, which are parallel to the axis, to maintain them in their original position. For the power of movement nests in these threads of the entire globe; they are distributed circularly around the axis with equal strength on all sides and by means of them this power turns the body. Thus therefore in turn the axis, maintaining itself in its proper direction through a natural constancy fixes also the region of the turning, with the result that because of the inclination of the axis, the circle of the movement is also necessarily inclined.

**Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, IV**

If the planetary globes have an inward rectilinear magnetic configuration, why do you not rather ascribe to them themselves the reason for their fleeing from the sun and approaching the sun, in proportion to the diversity of the regions of their body, as was done in the *Commentaries on Mars*?

1.  Because astronomy bears witness that this drawing away from the sun and drawing near to it takes place in a line so to speak extended towards the sun, in so far as the intermingled revolution does not vary the line. But the magnetic threads are rarely stretched out towards the sun.

2.  Because two very diverse things would be attributed to those magnetic threads. For first, they would point towards the same region of the world—which is something like rest; then they would move their body in place, now away from the sun, now towards the sun. But by means of repulsion and attraction this [movement of approach and withdrawal] is united more simply with the laying hold and making bodies revolve, which the sun furnishes.

3.  Furthermore, it is more probable that the form of the solar body and its virtue continue as far as to the planets than that their form and virtue continue as far as to the sun, so that, when repelling it, they flee, and when attracting it, they seek. For the sun is a huge body; while a planetary body is quite small. The light and heat of the sun manifestly descend to us; the sun makes the planets revolve. Accordingly before this, things were clear concerning other virtues of the sun. But we do not have such and so evident testimony concerning the prolongation of planetary virtue as far as to the sun.

4.  It will be shown below that the threads of the body suffer some slight deflection on account of the sun. Therefore it is probable that the libration of the whole body also comes to it from the sun rather than that it is inborn; that is, it is a passion from another, not an action or movement from the planet itself.

**But would you set down that this virtue is at least shared between the sun and the planets and that the force of repulsion and attraction passes back and forth from one to the other, just as it is shared between two magnets?**

No: rather this is the fifth reason why this repulsion and attraction is not attributed to the planets themselves: in order that there be no mutual attraction and repulsion according to the very institute of the Creator, who does nothing in vain. Therefore, if the virtue of the planet extended as far as to the sun, then the planets, in the direct ratio of the bodies, would move the sun out of the position which it occupies at the centre of the world, or at least the sun ought to stagger, attracted now in this direction, now in that, according as many planets having a like faculty assail the sun from one side.

**You seem not to avoid the following inconveniences: for the sun, leaning against the form and virtue of its body as against a pole and pushing the planets, pushes itself out proportionally, and drawing the planet as it were with its claws, it similarly draws itself to the planet?**

We have avoided this in every way by denying mutual attraction and repulsion. For firstly, neither the shape [*forma*] nor lay out [*dispositio*] of the bodies will be directed towards this, if such a virtue of the planet does not extend to the sun. Then something such does not actually follow—as though short of the Creator's design—from material necessity alone. For the bulk is so great, the density of matter in the solar body is so great, and its force of attraction and repulsion is so great; and in turn the weakness of the planet and the weakness of its resistance are so great; that the sun is in no danger of losing its position. Thus when a ship sticks fast in the sands and cannot be torn away and moved from its place except by two hundred horses, nevertheless one hundred horses, though they are half of the required virtue, do not move forward half of the lone thing, because there is no mean half-way between the moved and the not-moved, since they are contradictory.

**State a convincing hypothesis as to how any planet completes its circuits and is meanwhile attracted and repelled.**

Let us begin with that moment when the magnetic threads offer their sides to the sun, so that both extremities of the threads are equally distant from the sun; and this takes place, by the foregoing diagram, at A the greatest distance of all: at this time the sun is neither repelling the planet nor attracting it; but, as if hesitating between both, it nevertheless lays hold of the planet; and by means of the rotation of its body and the flowing out of its form, the sun makes to move forward from A to B the planet which it has laid hold of, and the sun overcomes its resistance and in turn is overcome by the planet, so that the sun lets it fall, so to speak out of its hands, *i.e.*, out of the preceding rays A of its form and virtue, and takes it up again with the following rays and does so in the fixed ratio of the virtue of the form in that interval. In this way the planet is moved forward, while in the meantime the magnetic threads, by the force of direction, look towards the same region of the world, in such fashion that the region friendly to the sun is gradually turned towards the sun, and the discordant bends away from the sun: at that time therefore the globe begins to be attracted—only a little, if there is little difference between the distances of the extremities from the sun: by this attraction the planet will go, from the wide circle begun at A, gradually inward to B and will betake itself towards the sun, as if into a narrower circle and a stronger, because denser, virtue of laying hold: hence it frees itself less easily from the virtue and so is moved on more speedily. This attraction, which is very slow at the start very near to A, is very rapid at the time when the sun has the whole friendly hemisphere of the planet within its view, but the whole discordant hemisphere is hidden behind the planetary body, *i.e.*, when the magnetic threads point in a straight line towards the sun; and that takes place around C, a quarter of the whole circular ambit. Thence around D once more this attraction towards the sun becomes more lax; but the velocity of the progress along the circle continues to increase, because the interval between the planet and the sun is still decreasing on account of the attraction. This relaxing of the attraction amounts to almost nothing in the beginning after C; soon, it is felt more and more, the more the unfriendly part of the planet thrusts itself out and offers itself to the view of the sun, towards D, until half of the circuit has been traversed and once more both hemispheres of the revolving globe regard the sun equally. For at that time all attraction stops, and the planet is very near to the sun, and so is very speedy, because it is struggling with a very dense and a very strong virtue of laying hold and frees itself hardly at all from that encompassing virtue.

But immediately the globe is borne beyond this place E on its orbit towards F, because already the discordant hemisphere is nearer the sun than the friendly hemisphere and is advancing more and more towards the sun. The planet too begins to be pushed away from the sun, as though out of a narrower and denser sphere of solar form into a wider, more rarefied, and weaker sphere. Whence the decreases in its movement follow, and in the contrary order: first, slowly, after E towards F; then, where the whole discordant hemisphere or region of threads points in a straight line towards the sun, but the unfriendly region is turned away from the sun: the planet is repelled very swiftly, but its movement has now once more slackened to middling. This again takes place around G the other quarter of the circuit. When the planet has been borne farther towards H, this repulsion again slackens, until it completely disappears at A, where the planet has returned to its primal place and has been repelled to its greatest distance from the sun.

**But it is unbelievable that the planet—this freedom allowed—should, after completing its return, be restored to exactly the same distance.**

Doubtless this is at last a good place for that pronouncement of Ptolemy's written out above, where he reminds us that nothing takes place in the heavens which hinders the natural movements of any body or which makes the bodies stray as it were from their foot-paths. And so, if such laws of movement have been instituted by nature that the planet return unto itself most exactly, then this will most certainly take place, although without the shackles of spheres, in the free ether. But the laws were made as we described them. For the halves of the circuit are equal to one another—the one in which the planet is attracted and the other in which it is repelled. Equal times are taken by both halves. Moreover, the virtue of the sun is the same and everlasting—both as attracting and as repulsing. And it has the same ratio to the planetary inertia, which is always the same, because in an everlasting body. Accordingly it does as much by attraction in one half, as it does by repulsion in the other. Why then should we be doubtful concerning the restitution of the planetary body to the original distance within one period of time?

Also in these terrestrial and violent movements, are not the movable bodies separated from that which was the cause of movement, as in scorpions, ballistae, catapults, bombardae, and slings? And weapons hurled fly through the free air, and nevertheless they reach their appointed place. And, for a wonder, there are some *sclopetarii* and slingers with a sureness of aim that cannot be imitated. If in this case the form of that movement—which movement was in the thrower at the moment of throw and was directed towards a fixed region—the form impressed into the movable body for a short time and vanishing has such power that, as long as the movable is carried by a form which has not yet become completely feeble, it does not cease to strive for its appointed region: by how much firmer defences will the certitude of the celestial returns be protected, which are governed by the inward and plainly united and hence everlasting threads of the movable thing—since in the first case the air disturbs the movement by its impact and encounter; and in the second case the density of the ether to be passed through is clearly nil in effect or else has a very slight effect.

**Why are not the librations of the different planets in the same ratio to their mean distances, that is, why is the eccentricity of Mercury greatest, next, that of Mars, and then those of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Earth, while that of Venus is least?**

The instrumental cause is the different strength of the threads, whether that is produced by nature or by posture. But the final cause is the same as that of the eccentricities themselves, namely in order that by reason of these eccentricities the movements of the planets should become very fast and very slow in such measure as would suffice for the harmonies to be exhibited through them. *Book V* of my *Harmonies* has to do with this.

**There remains one difficulty with respect to the direction of the threads towards the same region of the world. For since you said that one region of the threads has friendship with the sun, and the other is in discord with the sun, so that in conformity with the former or the latter region the sun either attracts or repels the body of the planet, it seems that the sun has the power over the planet to do what is less, namely to move these threads out of their parallel posture and to turn them towards itself, before the planet is transported into a position from which the threads can look towards the sun.**

There is nothing absurd in something like this taking place, so that the sun struggles with the direction of the threads, just as it struggles with the inertia of the body with respect to movement in place—provided we keep in mind that the sun accomplishes less with respect to deflecting the threads than in moving the whole body in place, just as it also accomplishes less in respect to attracting the planet. And this tempering pertains to the Creator’s plan, lest the planets should come into contact with the sun, if they were not transported into the opposite half of the circuit in a shorter time than the whole interval of time which could be spent in the direct attraction of the thread.

Therefore, since the circling of the planet around the sun forestalls the deflection of the threads, hence, although in one quadrant of the circuit the threads deflect somewhat towards the sun in their friendly region, and away from the sun in their discordant region; nevertheless, because the planet is transported into the other quadrant before the deflection of the threads becomes total, it follows equally that there is a change in the posture of the contrary regions, which are turned towards the sun, just as if the threads were not deflected; therefore in the remaining quadrant the sun by the same force gives a counter-deflection in the other direction to the planetary threads, which lie in the contrary position and turn their unfriendly region towards the sun. And so by the earlier contrary deflection the sun again restores the planetary threads to their parallel posture. In *Book V* this deflection and counter-deflection become the principal means of calculation.

**Could you cite a common example of this direction and mixed sloping of the threads?**

There is an example in the magnetic needle. For although it looks towards the north if it is free, nevertheless it is somewhat deflected from the north if a magnet approaches obliquely: for then it bows somewhat towards the magnet.

**What things are required for the perfect restitution of the threads to the parallel posture?**

That the sun expends as much of its forces in deflecting—say, through the quadrant PIN, attracting H the solipetal region of thread downward from line IS towards itself—as it expends in restoring, as through the quadrant NER, drawing back G the same region of thread upwards towards line SY, which is nearer to itself. But this can take place only if, with PR as the line of the apsides and PN and NR as full quarters of the orbit, NQ the thread of the planet, situated at N, the limit of the quadrants, points precisely towards the sun A. For even though, in the upper quadrant PN, the sun A administers this deflection SIH, BNQ, at long distances AP, AI, etc., and so with a feebler virtue, but in the lower quadrant NR at the short distances AIS, AR and so with a stronger virtue; yet in turn the planet delays longer in the upper quadrant PN and undergoes those feeble forces of deflection for a longer time; while in the lower quadrant NR the planet makes a shorter delay and has a shorter time in which to undergo the strong forces which counteract the deflection. And there is perfect counterbalancing. For the same perfect counterbalancing can also cause that at N, one and the same limit of the quadrants, the distance AN—in the rightly drawn orbit—should be equal to the semidiameter BP—as will be made clear in *Book V*.

**But what if the planet were to direct the thread NQ towards the sun not precisely after traversing PN the upper quadrant of the orbit but at some later time?**

Here the burden of proof is on the opposition. For where the thread points towards the sun is the limit of the quadrants, which are measured from the apsides. For IH, the deflection of the thread with respect to the perpendicular IS, is always increasing, as long as the thread H seeks the sun. But the increment of libration increases with it—the effect with the cause.

Therefore if, in this work of attraction of the planet towards the sun, more than a quadrant of the orbit is traversed with reference to the fixed stars; then more than a quadrant will have to be traversed by the planet in restoring the right angle between the thread and the sun at R and in the effect [of the restoration], or the remaining part of the libration, whereby the planet is brought from the nearness NA to the nearness RA, by the same degrees of increments which are now decreasing in the contrary order.

Therefore, when the quadrants are added together, their excess over the semicircle shows the magnitude of the change in direction of the threads under the fixed stars in half of one period, or the magnitude of the transportation eastward of B the centre of the orbit and PR the line of the apsides. Therefore if this magnitude is subtracted from that which is more than half of the orbit as estimated with respect to the fixed stars, there will remain not more than half of the elliptic orbit as reckoned from the apsis P.

**Then, do the apsides abide, or are they transported from one place to another under the fixed stars?**

In the case of Jupiter the comparison of observations made by the ancients with those of today bears witness that the apsides stand approximately under the same fixed stars, or retrograde very little. But in the case of all the remaining planets, the apsides are found to have left their original seats, by a movement in the direction eastward—as in the case of the apogee of the moon—but in the case of the planets by extremely slow movements, though the apogee of the moon progresses quite perceptibly.

**What is the reason why in the case of the primary planets, the threads are found so perfectly restored—after the whole periodic returns have been completed—that the progress of the apsides is imperceptible?**

Because it is the same sun which gives a libration to the planetary body and which deflects and restores its threads; and because in both acts it is the same threads by which as by instruments the planet is given a libration and is deflected: then there is no cause why the forces for both acts should not be measured out through equal times. For just as the planet, which points its thread NQ directly at the sun, would at some fixed time be joined even in contact with the sun, if it did not leave the line NA; so too the same planet, placed at the same N and, by a fiction, directing its thread at right angles to the line NA, would be turned around together with its thread in a fully equal time, so that in the end it would direct the thread NQ towards the sun. But just as to the libration there is added a third work, namely the moving of the planet out of its posture AN, so that the thread NQ no longer points towards the sun and hence is not attracted with the same strength towards the sun—and in this way it is seen too that full contact does not take place by a movement along NA, but is forestalled by the transportation from N to R, and the planet gets no nearer than RA; so too this same transportation of the planet from N to R anticipates this deflection of the thread, so that the thread will point at the sun long before it could have been rotated a whole quadrant by the sun; and so, instead of the quadrant of rotation, no more than arc QM is needed. But the angles of the past deflections, or the virtue expended in them, are measured by the sines—as will be made clear by examples of natural things in *Book V*. Wherefore as PB the total mean distance—or in the ellipse, NA—is to BA the magnitude of half the libration—the work of one quadrant; and this magnitude is the same as the eccentricity—so also NQ the semidiameter of the planetary globe, which is employed as the whole sine, will be to the sine of MNQ the angle of greatest deflection; and MNQ will be the angle of greatest deflection at the time when, by the transportation of the planet, a quadrant from P the place of greatest distance PA has been exactly completed.

But with the assumption of this proportion, it is demonstrated that the thread NQ points towards the sun A at the time when PN is a quadrant under the fixed stars, precisely. For let AN be equal to PB, as in the ellipse; and let B be the centre of the eccentric circle, and ABN a right angle, because its measure NR is a quadrant. Now from Q the solipetal limit drop the perpendicular QM upon BN. Two right triangles ABN and QMN are formed. And because it is assumed that NQ : QM : : NA : AB, then N, Q, and A will be in one straight line, or Q will point towards the sun.

But it has already been demonstrated above that if, when PN a quadrant under the fixed stars has been completed, the thread Q of the planet points towards the sun, so that BNQ is its angle of deflection; then it follows that in NR the other quadrant under the fixed stars the thread NQ is restored and BNQ the angle of deflection is annulled. Hence when the planet stands at P, the thread is once more parallel to BN, as it was at P. And this restitution of threads is complete after the semicircle has been traversed. Let the same judgment apply to the other semicircle; for when that has been traversed, the planet returns to the same position under the fixed stars.

**But since experience bears witness that the apsides are transported imperceptibly, and do not remain under the same positions among the fixed stars; then it follows that NQ looks towards the sun at not precisely a quadrant from P the original position of the apsis. What is the cause of this straying from the already established ratio of regularity?**

It seems that the imperceptible slowness of these movements must be sought for in material necessity—if anything else is—namely in the straying of the said movements, the libration and deflection, from one another through the intervention of a third movement. For it diffuses itself in an infinity of time, which has no beauty, as being indeterminate. But it is difficult to state what the intervening cause is: because all astronomers are not decided about the thing itself; nor, for most of them, does the thing have any fixed magnitude. But with magnitude removed, we lack any means of examining the causes (which some one might have searched into by conjecture) of whatever sort of latitudinal digression the planets may have away from the ecliptic. For the digression does not take place without the deflection of the threads NQ to AN the ray of the sun—a deflection as great as the digression of each planet. It is consonant with such a greater or lesser deflection that the work of the threads should be somewhat weakened—and that variously, in proportion to the varying relation of the digressions to the apsides. In Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury the mean longitudes^ have some latitude, but none in Jupiter; and the apsides of Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury progress in that proportion, while those of Jupiter stand still. Therefore since in other respects the force to deflect the thread of the planetary body becomes greatest at the apsides P and R, where the thread is presented to the sun at right angles, it is believable that this force becomes slightly weaker on account of the latitude. And the reason the force does not suffer the same loss from the libration too is that there the libration is almost nil in itself. In turn, the force of deflection at N is almost nil, while the libration is greatest: therefore the force of deflection suffers loss from libration here but not there, in proportion to the latitude. And it can happen that the deflection of the thread can be slowed up in this way; and with that given, what has already been unfolded takes place; the thread looks towards the sun more slowly, namely beyond the boundaries of the quadrant. But it has been demonstrated before that at that time the apsides are transported eastwards. Then, this can be the cause of the said phenomenon—a cause linked to physical or geometrical necessities, in accordance with the principles previously laid down.

2.  But in the meantime I would not rigidly deny that this effect can be a part of the design, so that it is not a consequence of necessity, or a mere consequence: because we are still ignorant of the magnitude of it. Then there will be room to speak about the final cause: to the final cause belongs the mutual tempering of the forces of libration, of the deflection of the threads, and of the revolution, in some fixed proportion: in order that, because the librations were prepared in order to set up the harmonies of the movements, any given harmony should not be born always in some one configuration of two planets, but in the succession of the ages would pass through absolutely all the configurations, and in order that thus all the harmonies of movements—which *Book V* of the *Harmonies* is about—should be mingled with all the harmonic configurations—which is the matter of *Book IV* of the *Harmonies*.

### Note by Kepler

A new and hasty correction has perverted the original and well-meditated text: 1. There is a *petitio principii*. 2. It is not in my design that there should have been a case of necessity: the direct variation of the libration with the deflection. 3. In the same place, the cause is not a cause. 4. One thing was proposed, and something else was demonstrated: it was a question of the fixed stars: and of the apsides.

The true cause of the almost perfect restitution is of physical necessity. For either the threads remain parallel, or else in one half they are deflected downward away from the apsis, as NQ, and in the other half, upward, since in both directions the counterbalancing is perfect, as was said; moreover thus the threads are parallel to one another at both apsides; therefore the restitution is perfect.

Therefore something false and contradictory is proposed: the straying of the libration from the deflection. Instead, the cause was to be given which is suggested. For in the upper quadrant PN the sun gives a slightly smaller deflection, in the lower quadrant NR, a slightly greater counter-deflection; if at any rate the fixed stars have their termini at the quadrants. Accordingly since the solipetal terminus G is at R, the point of the fixed stars, and is already above IS, and is therefore still nearer the sun; therefore the planet is still sailing on: wherefore R the perigeal apsis will be beyond R in the fixed stars. If the latitude of the planet is the cause of this thing, it will have to be explained in another way than where instead of apsides read *mean longitudes*, because in Jupiter P is not the node but the limit. Nor is it sufficient to look to Jupiter and to say the reason the apsis is standing still is that the apsis is at the limit. But it is necessary to explain this too:

# Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, IV

Why the progress of the apsides in the case of the other planets of very unequal periods is approximately equal under the fixed stars?

## 4. On the Movement in Latitude

> Under what laws do the planets digress in latitude away from the ecliptic?

Again, under a very simple law: that the plane which they circumscribe with the center of their body be exactly even in any period and that it be inclined to the plane of the ecliptic in a constant and invariable inclination—except in the case of the moon.

> If level planes are inclined to one another, they meet and cut one another in one straight line. I ask what that common line is, from which the orbit of the planet is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.

In all the planets, this line passes through the center of the sun; and the line of each planet extends to its own proper places on the ecliptic, which are opposite to one another from the center of the sun.

> How is this established?

Because, since the planet at two different points on its return, as at C and D, is seen to be under the ecliptic without any latitude; these two positions on the orbit are found by calculation to be in the same straight line CAD with the sun A; so that if ACM was at 17° of the Bull, the interval of time until the planet was seen again on ecliptic, together with the hypothesis of the eccentric circle, exhibits the line ADO of the other position on the eccentric circle at 17° of the Scorpion, that is, opposite 17° of the Bull.

> What is gathered from this?

The same as above, on page 910. For since the planes of all six eccentric circles meet at the one common center of the sun; then all cannot meet at once anywhere except at this center of the sun, because the line of section is not common to all, but proper to each planet. But different lines cannot meet at more than one point.

Accordingly, because the sun is the node common to all the systems: therefore either nature moves the planets by bodily virtues, or else mind, by rational commands. For the planets, the sun is a fixed mark which all their revolutions regard.

> What causes do you assign for the movement in latitude?

In the case of the planets, the sun is not the cause—unless the remote cause—for this deviation from the plane of the ecliptic; nor is there any need for the planet's intelligence in this work, nor for the above disproved substructure of solid spheres, upon which as upon chariots the planets travel along their orbit; and there is much less need of the spheres here than in the case of the librations into opposite altitudes or in the case of the movement in longitude. But some certain formation of the planetary bodies is alone sufficient to twist their orbits away from the ecliptic and to twist them back again.

> Why is not the sun ranked as a cause, since it has already been said that the lines of section go through the solar body itself?

Because one and the same sun, by means of one and the same form of its body, which form revolves in a uniform and very direct current along the mean circle between the poles of rotation of the sun, cannot carry different planets through other different paths, unless the planets add from out of themselves the causes of this differing digression in latitude.

> Of what sort do you hint that this formation of the planetary bodies is?

It can be either essential, that is, belonging to the inward rectilinear magnetic thread, or else accidental, namely, the rotation of the planetary globe around its axis performed in such a way that the threads or axis of rotation retain their parallel posture during the whole circuit of the body and have such a direction that, when the planet is on the ecliptic, it touches the orbit and deflects at one terminus somewhat towards the north, and at the other towards the south.

> Do you have a common example of this deflection?

The oars of ships supply some sort of example. For if the ship is being driven forward by winds, but an oar is tied obliquely to the stern, then the ship against which the line of wind is bearing is turned gradually to the side.

> The oar, pole, or rudder always directs the ship towards one single region. How therefore do the planets now depart to the sides of the ecliptic and now return from there to the ecliptic?

If the rudder of the ship is turned, the ship too deflects to the other side. Even though the planets keep their threads straight, in a parallel posture, and unturned, nevertheless the planets are transported to the opposite parts of their circuit, wherein the threads, by reason of their original posture, have the opposite inclination to their orbit; wherefore too the planets in the other semicircle are driven towards the opposite regions.

> In order that I may better understand this movement, state what surface one such thread or axis produces during the revolution of the planet around the sun?

Let us lay down that when the planet is on the ecliptic, as here at C and then AB the thread of latitude does not have any inclination with respect to the sun—though this can take place differently but with the same effect, if the posture is equivalent—but has such an inclination with respect to the plane of the ecliptic, that EA or CA the half [of the thread] is to be understood to be sunken below the paper—which represents the plane of the ecliptic—but the remaining half EB or CB stands out above the paper, and the angle of inclination is as great as the latitude is accustomed to be at the limits—F the limit above the paper and D the limit below. Moreover, let the movement of the solar form, as if of a river or wind, be from E towards F, C, and D.

Then since this movement at E is going to advance contrary to the sunken half of the thread AE, but at C is similarly going to advance contrary to BC the half which stands out and which is opposite AE. Furthermore, at E the movement pushes the planet up above the paper, in the direction whither B the front terminus tends; but at C it pushes the planet downward below the paper in the direction whither A the terminus in front of that position tends. In a rudder the opposite takes place, because the rudder is pushed by the force of the river, not driven by an inborn aptitude. But since meanwhile the thread AB remains in a posture parallel to itself throughout its whole circuit; hence, when the planet is most northern at F or most sunken in the south at D; neither terminus A nor terminus B is in front, but the thread AB, which stretches out as it were into the depth of this river, i.e., towards the sun, and which receives the attack on the right side, furnishes no cause for further removal into any region: wherefore a changing around takes place at these points, so that, although before point F the terminus B had been in front, now after point F the terminus A is in front; and so the planet begins to approach the ecliptic once more, at first with imperceptible progress.

From this it is now clear what sort of figure is engendered. For because the thread AB is moved from E towards that very region towards which the front terminus B tends; then the surface which is produced by AB is at point E diminished to a mere line, which nevertheless gradually becomes a surface, and, having arisen from the point E, acquires at F its greatest latitude, equal to the length of the thread AB: thence once more the surface is diminished as far as C, the segment of the circuit which is opposite E, the first-mentioned segment: there again the surface disappears into a line. The same things are to be understood of the opposite semicircle CDE. But the thread borne thus to F and D at an inclination and always following its own lead will produce a perfect plane, i.e., in so far as it keeps its posture parallel; and if this plane is continued, it will pass through the center of the sun because the thread AB looks towards the sun—at F with the terminus A; but at D, with the terminus B.

But with this continuation of the plane removed, if that which is produced by the thread is alone considered: it will be such a form as two little crescents exhibit between the two ellipses, BCAE the outer ellipse, and EACB the inner, which touch one another at C and E, so that the same line CE is the major diameter of the smaller ellipse EACB, but the transverse diameter of the greater ellipse CBAE.

Moreover, the center of the planetary body will revolve in a perfect plane, which in this figure was made circular, namely CDEF, although the plane itself also, as is clear from what was said above, bends away from the perfection of a circle to an ellipse with its lopped-off sides.

> The oar or rudder of a ship stretches out from the ship straight into the waves or wind: but these threads lie concealed within the round body of the planet: therefore it is not the same force which is in rudders.

It is not necessary that all things should correspond in an analogy. But in place of the oars there is the other much more suitable force in the threads. And just as, above, the threads have a natural inertia contrary to the deflection of themselves, or rather a power to keep their posture parallel during the transportation of the body; so now also there is present in the threads of latitude, in addition to the similar force to keep their posture parallel, a natural power of agility too, or of following exactly the same line and of directing along that line the movement produced in the planet, in so far as the movement tends towards the same region as the other extremity of the thread.

> Compare this form of movement in latitude with the ancient astronomy in an everyday example.

Here we entrust the planet to the river, with an oblique rudder, by means of which the planet, while floating down, may cross from one bank to the opposite. But the ancient astronomy built a solid bridge—the solid spheres—above this river—the width of the zodiac—and transports the lifeless planet along the bridge as if in a chariot. But if the whole contrivance is examined carefully, it appears that this bridge has no props by which it is supported, nor does it rest upon the Earth, which they believed to be the foundation of the heavens.

> Nevertheless is not this theory of the movement in latitude more difficult than if someone imagines solid spheres?

But, reader, you ought to remember that we are here busy with the physical theory of causes, on account of which any hypothesis is applied in order that we may know what of truth exists in such an hypothesis or astronomical fiction. But below, in Books V and VI, for the sake of understanding, we shall not reject the whole circles and their inclinations to the ecliptic; because they are equivalent to these attractions of threads to the sides of the ecliptic.

> If that earlier libration of the planet in altitude and this digression in latitude had the same boundary-posts on the ecliptic and were effected by the same threads, the causes which you assign would be probable.

Indeed, what prevents one and the same globe from having twofold rectilinear threads stretching out over the whole body, so that from some it receives a libration in altitude, and by the others is rowed backward and forward? Thus on the surface of rivers a threefold movement of the parts is discerned—each movement proceeding in its own direction: the first is the flow of water, the second that of the waves, which that flow casts crosswise to the banks in a continuous series, the third comes from the wind. For if a contrary wind blows obliquely, it roughens the surface of the waters, and starts another series of smaller waves moving in their own direction, and these waves advance on top of the earlier waves, which are not troubled. Thus above in Book I I mentioned the nature (*substantia*) of the body, which represents a triple-woven tunic and contains three kinds of threads, distinct as to their regions, the seats of the three faculties of attraction, retention, and expulsion: although the weaving belongs to not one but three tunics.

> Do not the farthest digressions of the planets always occur at the same positions on the zodiac, or do even these digressions change their positions?

Observation of the progression of the limits is more difficult still than that of the apsides: nevertheless they are seen to be going back gradually westward in the sphere of the fixed stars and more slowly than the apsides are progressing; there is a case of both in the movements of the moon.

> If the limits retrograde and the apsides progress, will the threads productive of latitude remain inwoven with the threads of longitude, both of which you have given to the same globe?

This retrogradation clears our way to the inward substance of the globes, into which narrows we have already been compelled to go, in the comparison of the daily revolution of the Earth with its threads of libration. Accordingly here too we can seek within the outer crust a separate globe—like the yolk within the white of egg—supplied with its own threads, and able to revolve according to the same laws, and with the strength of its forces different from that of the outer crust, if need be; so that both of them [the crust and the globe] can be deflected by the same outside cause, with different measures of speed, if there is need of this.

For thus in the case of the body which I have already brought in, there are three tunics: the outmost, the inmost, and the middle; and one of them can be passive, if the others are injured, or be active, while the others are at rest; although they are unlike this thing, in that they are not separated from one another.

The ancient astronomy places, solid and plainly adamantine spheres on top of other spheres, where no body is visible to us and the whole region is as transparent as if it were empty. Therefore it will not take offence if we construct something similar in the globes, which are visible and palpable bodies.

> Cannot this already mentioned axis of revolution of the outer crust of the planetary bodies perform this office of deflecting the movement of the planets latitudinally?

This cause rests upon very great probability, as will have to be said in Books VI and VII in the explanation of the schemata of the sun and the eighth sphere. Nevertheless nothing certain can be affirmed of all [the planets]: because even though we said it was believable that the remaining primary planets rotate around the axes of their bodies, nevertheless the regions towards which these axes tend or incline are unknown to us. Wherefore we have an example in the Earth alone. And the moon, a secondary planet does not rotate, although none the less it completes its latitudes.

> How can it be effected that the limits of digressions retrograde westward?

In Book VII part of this appearance will be explained as accidental, not as physical or real. But what remains of this movement and is real is caused by the deflection (*nutu*) westward of the threads of latitude: so that they remain in one and the same plane precisely, during their whole circuit, but the threads themselves—i.e., the globe itself—are deflected backward over the center of their body secretly in accordance with these threads.

> From what causes does this counter-deflection arise?

Up to now the probability of most of the causes brought forward was clear. But in this last train of astronomical matters, the causes have ill success; and both understanding and belief in those things which one is able to devise have to work hard. Let us however speak of as much as we can find out. We have said that the nature of the threads of latitude consists in an aptitude to move forward into the region of their own parallel direction. We have said moreover that while the planet is being transported from C or E, the position which it has on the ecliptic, into D or F, the position of farthest digression north or south, in the meantime those threads remain parallel, and for that reason it comes about that, since there at C and E the threads touched the orbit, now here at D and F they are sunken in the depth towards the sun, whither that movement to which they are deflected does not tend; rather at that time, the motor river from the sun, so to speak, meets the crosswise threads AB at right angles, more speedily below—that is, at A in the position F and at B in the position D—than above and on the outside. Therefore if the threads are deflected towards the movement, it is surprising if this deflection, which with its lower side seeks the region of the movement, takes something away from the parallelism and does so at both limits? So the retrogradation of the limits follows, since no counterbalancing exists. For A is pushed out, at F, along the road EAC; and B is pushed out, at D, along the same road GBE; so in both cases B will be deflected below the paper.

But if this cause is not admitted, then let the motor soul be summoned to twist together, by its laws, an inside kernel within the outer crust, according to the design of the Workman that by the interweaving of the orbits with one another and their frequent multiplication and condensation the solidity of the sphere might be somewhat penetrated by the planet in the succession of ages.

> Why is the regression of the limits slower than the progression of the apsides?

Although there is doubt concerning Mercury, there is also some doubt concerning Jupiter: nevertheless let us follow probability on account of the clear example of the moon, and let us say that the cause is as follows: because a disturbance, if there is any, coming from one and the same outside cause is necessarily more perceptible in a great movement than in a small. Now the transposition of the apsides arises from a great movement, which is the deflection and counter-deflection of the threads in any semicircle, and is as great as the optical additosubtractive difference (*aequatio*), and it would become greater and altogether total if it were not anticipated by the revolution of the planetary globe. But the transposition of limits takes place through a small movement, the digression of a few degrees in latitude, and is not greater than this measure of it, so that this digression can give rise to nothing else whereby the transposition of the limits may be hindered. Wherefore the same rays of the sun which introduce movements in both cases, by the laws already explained, have more manifest effects there [in the transposition of the apsides] than here [in the transposition of the limits]. In addition there is the fact that in the first case rays of the sun act in relation to a greater diversity than in the second, other things being equal. For in the first case the obliquity of the rays of the sun with respect to the threads—and this obliquity tends to the side—or the angle of latitude, whereby the work [of the threads] is weakened, was perceptible. In this second case the diversity between the parts of the planetary globe, and hence between the termini of the threads of latitude—the terminus nearest the sun and that farthest away from the sun—to which diversity we assign the movement of the limits, is mighty small. Accordingly by right this second work is less than that.

## 5. On the Twofold Irregularities of the Moon and their Causes

> These things which up to now have been argued concerning the causes by which the true movements of the primary planets are made irregular are not also to be understood concerning the moon, a secondary planet, are they?

1.  On the whole, the moon imitates the same general form of movement, around the Earth, as that which the planets keep to around the sun; and so too we ought to set down the same causes within the lunar body, that is, threads of magnetism, their rectilinear tract, and the contrary regions of that tract—one region friendly to the Earth and the opposite region unfriendly—and finally the approximate parallelism to itself of this tract throughout the whole circuit of the moon. Accordingly, when the moon has been transported into the opposite position, there is a changing around of the regions; and in conformity with the friendly region the moon is attracted by the form of the terrestrial body; and in conformity with the unfriendly region it is repelled. And its movement in longitude too is increased or decreased in that proportion; and similarly we must conceive of other threads in its body, by means of which threads the moon's digressions from the ecliptic are produced.

    In this diagram are represented some positions of the Earth going around the sun, together with the surrounding lunar heaven; and in the heaven of the moon some positions of the moon going around the Earth. But the image of the magnetized needle signifies the magnetic threads in the lunar globe, by reason of which the moon becomes eccentric to the Earth. For the points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G signify the region friendly to the Earth, and they lie at the second mean longitude, and so at A and G the moon is situated at the mean position between the perigee and the apogee; at B, D, and F it is a little before the apogee; at C, a little after the apogee; and at E and F, a little before the perigee.

2.  But since this movement of the Earth, as was explained above, is derived from two sources, as it were—namely, from the daily rotation of the Earth, and from the rotation of the sun around its own axis—and this sun is the midpart of the great sphere common to the Earth and the lunar heaven; so it will be reasonable that the true and real movement of the moon around the Earth—and in so far as that revolution around the sun, which is shared by both and is accidental to the whole lunar heaven, is removed from it mentally—has two sources, as it were, and suffers all those affects as twofold which the movements of the primary planets have as simple. And this is perfectly consonant with the experience and skill of artists, and with the words arising from this twofoldness. For not merely in the [pages] above, according as there was a solitary mean movement in some one of planets, was there a mean movement and a semimonthly variation of this mean movement in the case of the moon; but also here (*hoc loco*), where it is a question of the periodic irregularity of this movement, and this irregularity is not semimonthly like the variation but monthly or rather semiannual: we find in the moon a twofold intensification and remission of mean movement at the contrary moments of the period, instead of the simple intensification and remission found in any one of the primary planets—and finally instead of the simple digression of the primary planets in latitude also a twofold digression.

> What cause does the magnitude of the moon's eccentricity have?

In the *Harmonies* I demonstrate that the variety of lunar movements determines precisely the perfect fourth, which seems to have an affinity with the quadratures and syzygies of the moon. Therefore in order that this interval might be represented by a composite movement, the eccentricity was made to be as great as it is.

> What diversity is found between those irregularities common to the moon and the planets and these irregularities proper to the moon?

1.  Just as, in the above, the movement of the moon around the Earth had two elements, as it were, one from the rotation of the Earth around its axis, the other from the joining (*ex applicatione*) of the solar light with this motor form from the Earth—whereof the first was free of the phases of the moon, and the other was bound up with the phases; so now also, of the two irregularities, that earlier one is found to be an accident of the earlier element or the mean movement and to have its own proper termini, which we shall call the apogee; and the first type of digression in latitude has its own termini, distinct from the termini of the apogee, and they are called limits and nodes. But the later irregularity, which arises from a later element, or else is an accident of the acceleration in the syzygies, and is called by Ptolemy the nodding (*annutus*) of the epicycle, has termini in common with the lunar month and phases—as does the second type (*forma*) of digression in latitude.
2.  That earlier irregularity both of longitude and latitude is always constant throughout all its periods, that is, it is forever of the same magnitude: but each of the later irregularities becomes greatest in one month only of any half year, smaller in the remaining months, and in certain months, which divide the year into two parts, almost nil, namely, where the opposite affects, of this second acceleration and retardation and likewise of the northern and southern latitude, begin to pass into the contrary halves of the lunations.
3.  And so those earlier irregularities have their magnitude and the laws of their distribution from their own proper causes; but the second irregularities take their magnitudes and affects from the presence of the first irregularities in any one semicircle of lunation; they have laws of distribution alone separate, and adjusted to the cycles of lunations, but none the less similar to the earlier [laws].
4.  The following fact is also related: that in the moon we find the movement of the apsides eastwards, and the movement of the limits westwards, much faster than in the primary planets, not merely in the ratio of the faster periodic return of the moon, but quite perceptibly; and moreover the retrogression of the limits is more than twice as slow as the progression of the apsides.

> The moon is not seen alternately to turn now this part of its body, now the opposite, to the Earth. For we always view the same spots on the face of the moon. Wherefore the causes of the approach and withdrawal of the moon from the Earth cannot be sought from this.

1.  It is not necessary that at two opposite times of a period the lunar magnetic threads should point in a straight line towards the Earth; it is sufficient if at those moments they at least be deflected towards the Earth in their alternate regions, and if the posture of the threads remain parallel throughout the whole circuit of the moon. For it can come about in this way too that now one region of threads deflects more to the Earth, and now the opposite region. But if this deflection is small, our eyesight is not so sharp that in the disc of the moon it can observe very precisely whether on the rims of the lunar globe, which look towards the poles of the ecliptic, some minute particles present themselves to view, which are not seen at any other time. For those parts of the globe are shelving and of a very tenuous appearance, and the illumination frequently fails, now on this rim, now on that, on account of the inconstancy of the lunar countenance.

## EPITOME OF COPERNICAN ASTRONOMY, IV

2. For a long time we left it as uncertain whether there is a globe within the globe, like the kernel within the shell, having a different rotation from that — as the case of the Earth and also the movement in latitude suggested. And so such an inner globe could direct towards the Earth regions which are alternately reversed — notwithstanding that the outer crust always turns the same spots towards the Earth. For between these and similar things, it is uncertain exactly what the manner of this motion is: it is alone very certain that, whatever the manner is, it has been fitted to physical and magnetic causes, [614] i.e., corporeal and thus geometrical; and I have put forward examples of such causes in both cases here.

Then does not this second irregularity of longitude really come from some second eccentricity or digression of the moon from the Earth, just as the first irregularity has its cause in the change of the interval?

No: the observation of the parallaxes of the moon, together with a consideration of the eclipses, opposes this; and the ratios of the distance of the bodies from the first body militate against it — the ratios put forward in the first part of this book. But it can be argued that there is absolutely no change of interval bound up with the phases; because, though different experimenters make different corrections in the case of this hypothesis, the magnitude of this change is always made smaller and smaller. Ptolemy set it down as very large; Regiomontanus reduced it; Copernicus halved it and transposed it from the figure (*ex forma*) of an eccentric circle into the figure of the second epicycle; again, Tycho Brahe got hold of it and claimed a part for the equant circle, for which he together with Copernicus was accustomed to substitute an epicycle of twofold movement. I have changed around the intervals at the syzygies with those at the quadratures, and have transposed the cycles from the month to the year; relying upon these discoveries made in latter times, I at least found that absolutely no change of intervals occurred through the cycles of the phases.

Then from what comes this second acceleration and retardation which are bound up with the phases?

From the varying relation of the eccentric circle of the moon to the phases. For while the moon goes around the Earth, its mover, according to the simple and forever uniform law of eccentricity, just as any one of the primary planets goes around the sun; it comes about by accident that at different times the moon has different distances from its movement’s other mover, which accelerates the moon in the syzygies. For if its longer interval from the Earth occurs at the syzygies, where its greatest acceleration takes place; then the terrestrial form, unrolled in a wider sphere, is weakened at one of the syzygies — weakened not merely in its own native and archetypal vigour, but also in the reception of strengthening from the sun. In turn, if this longer interval between the moon and the Earth is found at the quadratures, where there is no acceleration; then there is no loss in the reception of vigour, and no gain with the short interval at the perigee.

In the diagram on page 952 are depicted in the globes of the Earth and moon the circles of illumination which divide the light part from the dark. But since the apogee of the moon, through the whole year and thus through all the positions of the lunar heaven, remains at the same point, i.e., the threads WF remain approximately parallel to themselves throughout the whole circuit, but the Earth together with the lunar heaven crosses from point to point; hence the threads are joined in different ways at different times to the circles of illumination — which spread out in accordance with a circle homocentric with the sun and exhibiting the density of the light in longitude — as you may see in the arcs DT, EV, FW, GX, AO, and BP. Accordingly the same thing takes place also at the apogee and perigee of the moon, as they always point towards the places 90° distant from the place or region of point A, B, Q, etc.

But what if the longer interval stretches towards the sun? Will not the movement be weakened in that way? And yet the moon is passing through a denser light.

Indeed, this is what we remarked about above. For the light of the sun does not move [the moon] by itself but by means of the form of the terrestrial body, to which it transmits the laws and modes of its own work. Accordingly just as above light did not give the direction of movement, but the form of the terrestrial body gave a direction, somewhere plainly contrary to the direction in which the sun moves around its axis; so now also the motor form from the Earth is strengthened in proportion to its own native strength, weakly where it is weak, namely at its farther distance from the Earth its source; strongly where it is strong, at its shorter distance from the Earth — whatever the variation in the distance of the moon from the sun may be, [616] as above, in the case of the causes of the variation, we spoke of the counterbalancings of this.

What is the measure (*modus*) of this monthly addito-subtractive difference, when it is very great, and what is the cause of its measure?

Tycho Brahe makes it equal to the physical part of the analyzed periodic addito-subtractive difference [*aequationis periodicae solutae*], according to my formulation, because since the total periodic difference is approximately 5° I claim half of that for the physical cause, the customary amount for all the planets — that is, 2°30′: accordingly Brahe exhibits the synodic difference to be that much — as if the motor form from the terrestrial body became precisely twice as strong at the near distance, and twice as weak at the far, through this strengthening by the light, and that is the time when it is without this strengthening. And if it is asked why that ratio holds, it seems that it can have no cause [617] except this relation of equality, as the most simple and therefore the most beautiful ratio.

But Ptolemy exhibits its measure as slightly greater, and just as much as above, from the addition of 132′45″ to 12 synods, we inferred the variation of one quadrant to be, namely 2°41′. But if this measure and magnitude is to be kept at both distances, then it seems that the cause must be transferred from design to geometrical necessity, namely, because the increase of the interval, i.e., the eccentricity, utterly exhausts that which the acceleration by the light at that syzygy had given; but in turn at the other syzygy the subtraction of the eccentricity from the interval adds as much to the speed as was also produced by the acceleration given by the light.

So in a month, which is without the synodic addito-subtractive difference, namely when in this diagram the apogee is at EF and the perigee at IK, the parts of acceleration given by the light are equal at both syzygies, because the intervals between the moon and Earth at both syzygies, as AC and AH, are equal during that month; in the succeeding months, as inequality of intervals arises gradually at the syzygies — for example, if L were the apogee and N the perigee, then the distance AC would certainly be greater than AH — there also arises some monthly addito-subtractive difference, which always becomes greatest during that whole month at EF and IK; finally in that month wherein the synodic addito-subtractive difference is complete — for example, if the apogee is at CD — there is no acceleration at the syzygy CD, but at the other syzygy GH the acceleration is twice as great as in the month just spoken of; at that time at the quadratures F and K the addito-subtractive difference is the greatest of all those which can occur during the total year. But at G very near to the perigee, there are four parts to the very small addito-subtractive difference, (1) the optical, as in the planets, (2) the physical, as in the planets, (3) the variation due to light, (4) the intensification of the same on account of the distance being diminished. The ratio of these four parts to one another is of geometrical necessity. But the sum composed thus of all four was so attuned by design that GH, the perigeal movement of the moon at the syzygy, would be to CD, the movement of the moon at the quadrature, as 4 is to 3; and that the harmony would be the perfect fourth.

[618] For that reason it comes about that although these two, (1) the measure of acceleration at the syzygies and (2) the measure of eccentricity, are bound to one another by no necessity; nevertheless the eccentricity exactly destroys the acceleration at the apogeal syzygy and doubles it at the perigeal syzygy. I say that at present, while I have been unable to investigate it.

What probable cause do you assign to the so great speed of the apsides and limits of the moon, if the apsides and limits of the primary planets are incomparably slower?

Indeed the effect of the composition of motor virtues in the moon is made clear. For just as in the above pages we said that the simple force of the Earth was attuned to harmonic numbers — at any rate in the rotation of the terrestrial body around its axis, to 360 perfect days, but in the revolution of the moon around the Earth, to exactly the 12 months in one year, or in one periodic return of the centre of the Earth around the sun; so now too let us say that in the deflection and restitution of the threads of the moon — those by which the libration and those by which digressions in latitude are produced — their simple forces are attuned to the great length of the periodic time of the moon in the same proportion as was kept in the other planets. But just as in the above, on account of additional aid from the sun, both in making the terrestrial globe rotate and in making the moon revolve, the archetypal numbers were disturbed in their final effect, so that instead of 360 days there were 365 1/4 and instead of 12 lunations in the year, approximately 12 3/4; so now too on account of this increase in the same acceleration of the moon from the illumination of the sun, the moon comes to the mean latitudes of its circuit before the threads are deflected in the right measure; and so the thread looks towards the sun from a deeper place (*loco profundiori*) than a quarter [of the distance] from apsis [to apsis]. And I inculcated above that the transportation of the apsides took place when that occurred. But it is quite right that this transposition of the apsides should be perceptible, because that increase [619] is perceptible, namely approximately 11°; nonetheless this transposition is smaller, i.e., slightly more than 3° in a month: (1) because those degrees [of increase] are for the most part added on at the syzygies, but the threads are most deflected and counter-deflected at the mean longitudes without reference to the syzygies; in such a way that the effects of degrees equal in number are very distant from one another; and it is probable that something still remains hidden at that node, and that by our ignorance of it the movements of the moon have not yet been worked out to the minute, not even in Tycho’s calculation. (2) Because the deflection of the threads is anticipated not merely in place and time but also in magnitude for that very reason. For if the moon had advanced more slowly, or if the deflection of the threads were as great in the accelerated moon as it would have been in the slow moon, the apsides would be transported even farther. But it comes about by the acceleration of the moon that the thread points towards the sun before it reaches the just measure of deflection originally assigned to it. And by the mixture of these things it comes about that a certain mean, 3 3/4° between the nothing or something imperceptible — which would be the case without the acceleration of the moon — and the 11° — which the acceleration causes — overflows into the movement of the apsides. The same things are to be said concerning the impulsion or deflection of the threads of latitude; for it ought to have been imperceptible, as in the primary planets — if the moon, like the primary planets, was going to advance according to a simple force. But because the acceleratory force which is added to the moon is evaluated at approximately 11° of longitude in efficacy; and if this force fell upon these threads of latitude during the whole cycle, it would deflect them, as not fortified against itself, the whole 11°; but since it gets possession of them only at the limits where they are in opposition to it, it gives them, however, a deflection of 1 3/4° one period. And the precession of the limits follows upon this deflection.

But although from the observation of so many ages exact determinations have been made of the magnitudes and ratio of these two movements of the apsides and the limits; there still remains room for talent. For he who brings forward such causes of these things that from the causes the magnitude itself follows, will drive his chariot to the goal. And philosophers ought all the more [620] to strive, because, over and above so many other experiments, in this question too the moon is our mistress in acquiring knowledge of the celestial bodies, and by its own example it throws light upon the nature of all the planets.

How is it that besides its accustomed periodic latitudes the moon also makes synodic digressions to the north and to the south?

Just as that force of light which strengthens the terrestrial form, the mover of the moon, borrows the region of movement and the proportions of the work itself from that very form which it strengthens; moreover just as, in the case of longitude, that force passes over into the inborn character (*ingenium*) of the orbit according to the measure of the mutual joining; so we must set down that that force does the same thing in the case of latitude. It facilitated the movement in longitude, because it extends in longitude; therefore it will facilitate the movement in latitude, because it has the other dimension of latitude also, i.e., because light is a surface partaking of density, as we have often recounted from optics. Accordingly at the syzygies, where the thread of latitude is tangent to the orbit and has been deflected in proportion to the latitude of the terrestrial form, the latitude of light joining itself to the terrestrial form facilitates the digressions, so that they take place at an angle greater than that which the thread makes with the plane of the ecliptic; and in that way the moon arrives in the quadratures at farther limits to the north and to the south than those which the thread showed at the syzygies. Conversely, during the other quarter of the year the thread of latitude, which is tangent to the orbit in the quadratures, does not fit itself to the dimension of the form of light in latitude, but points approximately towards the sun, just as the orbit itself of the moon does. Therefore just as in that place the movement in longitude is not at all facilitated by the light, but is made more difficult as it were; so the same thing overflows into the digression in latitude, so that it does not become greater than the angle by which the thread of latitude is deflected towards the ecliptic; and thus the moon does not arrive in the syzygies at limits farther than those which the thread showed in the quadratures. But what happens to the moon turning at the limits, or with what face the light of the sun beholds the moon, namely, when [621] the thread of latitude points towards the Earth, has nothing to do with latitude.

Since you reduce everything to the bodily threads of the globes and to the immaterial forms from the rotating bodies of the sun and Earth, and lastly to the light of the sun as a strengthening cause, you leave nothing to the animal faculties: hence you seem to be philosophizing just as if someone were to contend that its triple threads were sufficient to the belly for its operation and that there is no need of the animal faculty?

Rather, I admit a soul in the body of the sun as the overseer of the rotation of the sun and as the superintendent of the movement of the whole world. Nor in Book I did I deny absolutely that the planetary bodies had single souls as overseers of the rotation of their bodies. But just as it was not necessary to introduce a special soul into the threads of the belly; for it is sufficient for one common soul from the heart or liver to advance, through its own form or through heat, into the belly and to employ the faculties of its threads; so too in the world that form — of light, or heat, and thus too, if you will — from the soul of the sun, flowing out together with light and heat and penetrating even where light and heat are shut out, i.e., into the inner threads of bodies, seems to be sufficient; hence, just as the soul in the body has no power without the organ of the belly, so too the soul of the world has no power without these laws and without the geometrical lay-out of bodies.

Therefore let the status of the controversy be noted: for it is certainly one thing to reduce every cause [*rationem*] of dispensing celestial movements — although involving contradictions, and hence impossible — simply to the hidden forces of some soul, after rejecting all bodily organs and all the means which the human mind can devise — and that is the sanctuary [622] of all ignorance, the death of all philosophy, but is nevertheless the common practice of most of those who write or speak about astronomy, and in the above was noted in part even in Ptolemy himself. It is something else first to discern within the bodies everything suited for movement, so that the possibility of movements may be apparent — even with common examples — and afterwards finally to pour in a motor soul on top of all those things, as upon the human body compacted of all muscles and nerves. For if the soul can perform its functions anywhere by bodily organs, it will have no need in them for design and discourse, acts proper to an intellectual soul — just as, on the contrary, if it performed everything by design and discourse, it would not want those bodily organs.

In brief, the philosophers have commented upon the intelligences, which draw forth the celestial movements out of themselves as out of a commentary, which employ consent, will, love, self-understanding, and lastly command; the soul or motor souls of mine are of a lower family and bring in only an impetus — as if a certain matter of movement — by a uniform contention of forces, without the work of mind. But they find the laws, or figure, of their movements in their own bodies, which have been conformed to Mind — not their own but the Creator’s — in the very beginning of the world and attuned to effecting such movements.

### END OF BOOK FOUR, THE FIRST BOOK ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE SCHEMATA OR OF CELESTIAL PHYSICS

## BOOK FIVE

### LETTER OF DEDICATION

[631] To the Very Reverend, Most Illustrious, Most Highborn, Most Noble, Vigorous, etc. Lords, To the Orders of the Archduchy of Austria-on-the-Enns, To My Most Gracious Lords:

Four years after the publication of the first part of *Copernican Astronomy*, which contains the doctrine of the sphere unfolded in three books, one year after the publication of Book IV, wherein I have handed on the celestial physics, or the principles of the doctrine of the schemata of the planetary movements; there at last follows some time the speculative part — so called from the schemata, that is, the manual instruments wherein as in mirrors (*speculis*) the movements of the single planets are represented.

[632] If I regard the circumstances of the time, this publication, alas! arrives in town late, after a very destructive war has arisen and the assemblages of students for whom these things are written have either been dispersed by the confusions of war or thinned out and wasted away by the expectation of war; after Austria, hitherto my nurse and benefactor, has struck against a very hard reef and seems to be called away from the guardianship of these beauties to serious care for her own safety; and after I too, forced by the hatefulness of a private enemy to leave my home at Linz, have been moving around for nearly a year away from home.

If the causes of such great delays have to be mentioned, I shall not allege the supineness of my publisher — which has lasted from the publication of the doctrine of the sphere up to now — or the inconveniences of present war or the fears of threatening war: the fact that this publication has been prevented till now calls for thanks, not blame. Then what cause shall I mention, whereby I may preserve my reputation and wash away the charge of negligence? 

> “While our womanly manners are at work,” says *Comicus*, “while they dress their hair, a year passes by.”

But if the manners of astronomy are known to anyone, he will be able to say that he has never known a slower or more painstaking woman. [633] For unless this time had been interposed, wherein my designs might reach their maturity, there was danger that that finicalness, now that the whole world was squeamish, would demand new outlays and new adornments. For the computation of the *Ephemerides* and the publication of the books of the Harmonies — the works of the intermediate time — gave me many warnings that although most of the things which have to do with the six planets had been drawn up or at least indicated twelve years ago in my *Commentaries on Mars*; and although, taken over from that and put together into the form of a textbook, they had remained in my writing desk for seven years now, awaiting the work of the printer and engraver; nevertheless as often as I reread them, what with additions or elucidations or transpositions of the text, the necessity of making a new copy was imposed upon me. To such an extent that not a trace of the first draft was left in what was shown to the printer. Now as regards the moon, the last of the planets: when I first gave my attention to the publication of this *Epitome* I had no special concern about the moon, because Tycho Brahe's hypotheses about the moon already existed, and they could [634] in general be found to be equivalent to those hypotheses too by which the manifold movements of this planet were reduced to my physical causes. Moreover those hypotheses existed as shadowed forth in the *Commentaries on Mars* and as worked out further in my *Hipparchus*. But they were of such sort as to suppose two circles in the moon, eccentric in each case — a thing quite inimical to physical speculations, and hence intolerable. The computation of the *Ephemerides* rested upon those bases: and from the foreword to it, it is apparent that the form of the calculation has been changed again and again, because its agreement with appearance fluctuates and vacillates everywhere.

Finally the great felicity of my speculations freed astronomy from this cross in the month of April 1620, when, after the physical causes had been considered more carefully, it appeared that the second eccentric circle of the moon was superfluous, so that there was no further need for imagining it with reference to the movements in longitude. And it was already time to put the finishing touch upon the fourth book of the *Epitome*, which is about the principles of the doctrine of the schemata. That done, I transferred my attention to the publication of it, in the midst of the Bavarian armies and the frequent sicknesses and deaths both of soldiers [635] and of civilians. However, in the year 1621 the *Ephemeris* was at once computed, and — after the fashion of my other *Ephemerides* — the foreword was made to signify publicly my rejoicing over the conquering of the second eccentric circle of the moon. But, forestalled by the necessity of my journey, I could not yet publish this *Ephemeris*.

Now as regards this last part of the *Epitome*, comprehended in three books; although after the publication of Book IV, I am away from home and spend no little time in journeys and in the law-courts, nevertheless I have been allowed to be at leisure the greater part of the time, and I have devoted all that time to the care of this publication. When I came to Tübingen at the end of the year 1620, in order to expound to Maestlin a new rationale of lunar hypotheses, I began to write down questions about the other planets and the moon too in accordance with the physical hypothesis finally discovered.

As soon as I returned to my family at Ratisbon, I reread the questions and gave them over to be copied. In the meantime I turned to the last part of Book VI, up to now postponed, because I hoped of its being easy, and it seemed that it could be put together between proof-readings; but [636] I found it laborious, not so much for the difficulty as for the multitude and variety of questions and the worry over the method. A short time I spent at a monastery passed in drawing up the ancient epochs and in computing the eclipses. At once, as soon as I returned to Tübingen, I saw that the fourth part of Book VI, on the moon, would have to be reshaped and work repeated, because the definitions conceived verbally did not yet accurately represent the force of my hypothesis.

During the last months May and June, Stuttgart gave the last little book, which was also included in the last part of my cares up to now: because the

astronomers have too little evidence concerning the movements of the eighth sphere; but most of the things which could be said concerning this matter had been conceived by me in the *Commentaries on Mars*, in Book III of the *Epitome*, long published, and on other pages. Nevertheless many things arose on the occasion of my conversation with Mästlin, my old leader in taking the route of Copernican astronomy, and many things through the reading of books which I had hitherto been unable to get hold of in Austria. And if publication had not been postponed till now, these things would necessarily have to have been passed over.

[637] Meanwhile, with the shore of this voyage in sight—i.e., the end of this work—and after being refreshed by money sent secretly to Linz, then by the argument of the faith and kindness of your Very Reverend Doctor of Divinity, Antony, President at Kremsmünster, and finally with a truce intervening in the law-courts—my great grief—I gave June over to the journey to Frankfort, and to looking after the printing. And here once more, while the work is being undertaken, while the pages, diagrams, and forms are being prepared, a month passes by. And this sidereal lady, who heretofore bore witness to her fretfulness by her countenance and her noddings, now ratifies and exercises her fretfulness, after finally coming to the press, by quarrels and abusive language, only not by hands and weapons.

Therefore, Very Reverend, Illustrious, Highborn Lords, let her stand before you to plead my cause, which can be got hold of for me from the daily delayings of this publication. Come to an understanding with her. If you have become experienced in listening to her sarcasm, you will not easily demand scrupulous accounts of time from him who proves that the case is with him as with her, especially if he can show the value of the time and the work.

But after I myself too, whom I believe to care for those arts—i.e., the proclaiming of the divine works, [638] and who has followed the footprints of divine providence in an indefatigable search—after I recall to mind what utility the little book will have drained from this delay in time, I am not so frightened by your adversities, Masters—which have meanwhile risen up against you and the wretched province or else seem to make further threats—as not to perform my task, fulfill the promise made to you in the dedication of the little book on the sphere, and pay my debt, because I have hitherto been living off your subsidy. For I hope that there is so much divine mercy left in the store-house that He will that this horrible tempest be calmed, the clouds dispersed, and the sun at last shine again upon the penitent, and that some place be left even in Austria for these peaceful arts, the labour over which He does not stop caring for, and that there be gathered together in Austria once again some number of those who learn from these arts the praises of God their Creator. I hope that this little book will be of service to those people. For it contains the first adumbration, so to speak, of the *Rudolphine tables*, and the approximate numbers. If these numbers are assumed as true, the lovers of this discipline may exercise themselves with them until the *Rudolphine tables* themselves come out, furnished with everything accurately corrected, fixed for calculation, and ready for use. Furthermore, [639] if outsiders get any utility from my books, as there are very many people not only in Germany but also in the surrounding kingdoms and provinces who seek these books at Frankfort; it is right for them to learn from this dedication of mine that, for whatever value this book has, they ought to give thanks also to your liberality, Masters, wherewith uninterruptedly you have fostered me throughout these very difficult times. With that learnt, according as each is most disposed towards the arts of mathematics, most devoted to God, and most assiduous in gratitude, the crown of the virtues; so let him very frequently join his prayers with mine to the most merciful God: that, with the tumults of war calmed, the devastation restored, and hatred extinguished, golden peace returning may smile upon the Empire of the Most Powerful Divine Ferdinand II, Emperor of Rome, Our August Lord, and that God may revivify all the provinces of His Majesty, and especially Austria-on-the-Enns, with the fruitful showers of His grace. And that finally to you, Very Reverend, Illustrious, Highborn, Noble, Vigorous Masters, God may bring and make permanent for many years safety, health, riches, and dignities, for His own glory, for the preservation of the Church, for the adornment of the most glorious Emperor, and finally for the necessary cultivation of those arts [640] wherein the divine name is held in honour. Farewell, Masters, and hold within your liking your little client, who is absent in body for a short while, but quite present in spirit for all acts of obedience. At Frankfort on the Kalends of July 1621.

Reverend and Illustrious Lords, Farewell,
your most devoted Mathematician,

Johannes Kepler

## SECOND BOOK ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE SCHEMATA
### Part I. On the Eccentric Circles, or Schemata of the Planets

> [641] If you set up no solid spheres in the heavens and if all the movements of the planets are regulated by natural faculties, which are implanted in the bodies of the planets, then I ask what will the theory [*ratio*] of astronomy be? For it seems that the theory cannot do without the imagining of circles and spheres.

> It can easily do without the useless furniture of fictitious circles and spheres. But there is such great need of imagining the true figures, in which the routes of the planets are arranged, that we are impoverishing Astronomy and that the big job to be worked on by the true astronomer is to demonstrate from observations what figures the planetary orbits possess; and to devise such hypotheses, or physical principles, [642] as can be used to demonstrate the figures which are in accord with the deductions made from observations. Therefore when once the figure of the planetary orbit has been established, then will come the second and more popular exercise of the astronomer: to formulate, and to give the rules of, an astronomical calculus in accordance with this true figure, or even to make use of the figure as expressed in material instruments not otherwise than the solid spheres of the ancients were used, and through these figures to lay the movements of the planets before the eyes.

> Therefore what is the subject-matter of the Fifth Book, the second book on the doctrine of the schemata, and how do you keep its subject-matter separate from that of the preceding Fourth and the following Sixth?

> So far, in Book IV, the physical principles of movements—among other things—have been demonstrated by reasons and by experiments. Out of these physical principles Book V will form the figures of the planetary orbits and will explain the powers [*potestates*] of those figures; and there the inmost sanctuaries of geometry will have to be searched. Book VI will teach the use of these figures in the schemata of the single planets and put them into operation. So Book IV contains the theory; Book V, the instrument; and Book VI the practice; Book IV was physical, Book V is geometrical, and Book VI will be properly astronomical.

> How many parts does Book V have?

> Two: in the first part the eccentric circle and its plane are connected up with physical causes: in the second, there are given definitions of the astronomical terms which occur universally among all the planets in the case of the eccentric circle; and the method of calculation is explained in so far as it relates to this part.

> Then what sort of figure of the planetary orbit is formed according to the physical principles of Book IV?

> If the body of the planet did not have magnetic threads, [643] so that in accordance with one of the regions of magnetic threads it is drawn to the north, and in accordance with the other region towards the south—in accordance with one region it is attracted towards the sun, and in accordance with the other is repelled; then the sun in the rotation of its body around its axis, carrying around the immaterial form of its own body throughout the widest spaces of the world, would carry around with itself the planet held fast by that form, and (1) if the planet at the start had been situated under the ecliptic, its whole route would be arranged along the plane of the ecliptic; (2) and so the planet would always return to that very point where the start was made; (3) the body of the sun and the planetary orbit would have the same centre; (4) the figure of the orbit would be a perfect circle; (5) the planet in all equal portions of this circle would be moved with equal speed.

> But because we have laid down that in the body of any planet there are present twofold threads: therefore by the mingling of the faculties of the planet's body and the sun's motor power, (1) the planet describes an orbit oblique to the ecliptic; and because the threads of latitude remain in approximately a parallel posture during the whole circuit but not wholly so, and hence they are deflected gradually after many revolutions; therefore (2) the plane contained by the orbit of the planet is approximately a perfect plane but not wholly so; and hence, when one revolution has been completed, the centre of the planetary globe does not return exactly to its starting-point, but it entwines a new circle with the first circle traversed and described—after the fashion of the circles of the natural days—of which I have spoken in Book III, page 291—or after the fashion of the thread which the silk-worm drops, throwing the thread around itself and building a little house by the inweaving of many entwined circles. For this reason the longest digressions in latitude are not found in all ages in the same parts of the zodiac. And because the threads of libration make the planet to be drawn away from the sun to one side but then to be driven away from that region; accordingly the planet (3) describes its orbit around the sun but not as around its own centres, that is to say, it describes an orbit eccentric to the sun; [644] and for this reason the orbit is not (4) a perfect circle, but one slightly narrower and more pressed in on the sides, like the figure of an ellipse. (5) For the same cause and because the form of the solar body, which form gives movement to the planet, is slighter and weaker in the larger circle, it is not possible for the planet to be moved with the same speed in all the parts of its orbit; but the planet is slow at a long distance from the sun and fast at a short distance. Finally because too the threads of libration are moved out of their parallel posture by very many successive revolutions, so too the positions on the zodiac where the planets are highest and slowest do not always remain but gradually move eastward.

> Have you not described an intricate figure for the route of the planet and one that cannot readily be laid before the eyes especially in a plane?

> Even if this is true, it is nevertheless not new to astronomy or something found only in Copernicus; and there is no need for all things to be represented in the same plane; but those interweavings, which have arisen from the very slow movement of the boundary-posts of latitude and altitude, can be disentangled with the same dexterity which the ancient astronomers employed and with less apparatus.

> How did the ancients disentangle the movements of latitude and of altitude?

> They devised for the latitudes one circle or sphere which is the carrier or deferent of the nodes, the outermost circle of the whole schema of the planet—and for the altitudes two spheres of unequal thickness, which they named the altitudes of the *deferentium auges*.

> Why do you judge that those spheres or circles should not be used?

> Because they were made for laying physical explanations of movement before the imagination rather than astronomical. And so by their use [645] those false physical opinions concerning the solidity of the circles or spheres were established; and in turn the true judgments were obscured concerning the causes of their irregularities and of their very slow transportation—these causes were demonstrated in Book IV.

> Therefore what do you substitute for these three circles or spheres in laying your astronomical explanations before the imagination?

> It is sufficient if we draw two straight lines from the centre of the sun, one through the intersection of the planet’s orbit with the ecliptic, the other through the centre of the planet’s orbit—both lines, on either side and everywhere under the fixed stars—and if we teach that the movement of the first line is under the ecliptic towards the westward signs and that the movement of the second line is eastward under the circle, in the sphere of the fixed stars, which is in the same plane as the orbit of the planet—both movements most regular, the first movement from the mean equinoctial point and the second movement from the line of intersections [of the planet’s orbit with the ecliptic]. Unless something should here be taken from Book VII on the ground that even the ecliptic is dislocated and does not always run through the same fixed stars.

> When this separation has been made, what remains for our imagination concerning the figure of the route of the planet?

> The orbit remains as a perfect ellipse in a true and most regular plane inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at constant angles, by which plane of the ecliptic [646] this orbit is cut in the line drawn through the centre of the solar body—as was stated on page 946, Book IV. The planet moves in this orbit with unequal speed through its parts and returns to the intersections, and so to the equinoctial points—not to say to the fixed stars and to the line through the centres, by absolutely equal measures of periodic times, so far as they are considered in themselves.

> Does not this imaging trespass upon the physical causes and measures of the movements of one period?

> Not very far, provided we keep in mind that those things which are abstracted by means of the said two lines from the real inweaving and interconnection of many orbits [646] are not furnished physically by those two lines but by the inclination of the real threads of the planet's body.

> By what right do you make this also a part of Copernican astronomy, since that author abided by the opinion of the ancients concerning perfect circles?

> I admit that this formulation of the hypotheses is not Copernican. But because the part concerning the eccentric circle is subordinate to the general hypothesis which employs the annual movement of the Earth and the stillness of the sun: therefore the name comes from the more important part of the hypothesis. Moreover, this small part of the hypothesis is bound up with necessary arguments arising from the repose of the sun and the movement of the Earth, the doctrines of Copernicus; and so this part has a good title for being referred to Copernicus.

> What is the method of procedure whereby it will be demonstrated by the physical causes established in Book IV that such a figure of the orbit arises and what speed the planet has through the parts of its orbit?

> We must start with the approach and withdrawal of the planet from the sun; and first, we must determine the geometrical measure of the strength of the forces exerted in giving the planet a movement of libration in any posture of the threads. And second, we must prepare a compendious geometrical measure of the effect of the attraction or repulsion, which is heaped up through any whole arc of the orbit by all the increments of the forces. Third, we must demonstrate that the elliptical figure of the orbit arises from such a libration completed during the revolution. Fourth, we must show that the plane of the ellipse exhibits the measures of the time and of the delays which the planet makes in any arc of its elliptical orbit. Fifth, we must teach the equivalence of the plane of a circle and the plane of an ellipse with respect to this measuring of time. Finally, we shall have to demonstrate that when the revolution of the threads of latitude has been thus procured, as [647] was laid down in Book IV, the regularity of the orbital plane is established. By these demonstrations the studious astronomer—for the popular astronomer has no need of Book IV or of this first part of Book V—will have his curiosity satisfied concerning this part of the calculus of movements. The other part of Book V will teach how to construct this calculus; and Book VI, how to bring it into use by the application of this elliptical orbit and its plane to the great circle or sphere.

### 1. Concerning the Increment of Libration

> Begin with the first and say on what principles the measure (*modus*) of increment of the libration in every position of the planet is formed or determined.

> Two causes, one active and one passive, come together for the formation of this increment. The active cause is the quantity (*modulus*) of the forces of libration in themselves, that is to say, how great the quantity (*modulus*) is found to be in any equal arc of the eccentric orbit. The passive is the varying lay-out of the planetary body with respect to the sun; for not every lay-out receives or admits that whole quantity (*modulus*) of forces, but any lay-out receives its own proper portion [of the forces].

> So what measures the quantity of the forces for giving the planet a movement of libration?

> These three do: first, the distance of the arc of the orbit from the sun; secondly, the magnitude of this arc; and thirdly, the time which the planet takes to turn through this arc.

> What does this distance of the arc—and of the planet in the arc—from the sun have to do with the forces of libration?

> The ratio of the distances is the inverse of the ratio of the tenuity of the solar form. This same form carries the planet around and gives it a movement of libration, now attracting it and now repulsing it, as was said in Book IV, page 903. And so the farther the arc is distant from the sun, the weaker at any moment of time is the libration of the planet moving in the arc. For this reason alone, the sun would expend unequal forces in different arcs of the eccentric circle which are equal to one another.

> [648] What effect does the magnitude of the arc of the planet have?

> Because in a long arc much force is expended, and in a short arc little force: therefore if equal arcs are assumed, so much and so far should the forces be equal.

> What does the time, taken separately, have to do with the increase of forces, and what do all three causes, taken together?

> Since—Book IV, pages 903-06—it has been shown that the farther the planet is distant from the sun, the longer does it delay in the equal arcs of the orbit; and so much the longer does it feel the motor force of the sun, the greater the magnitude of that arc; but since it has already been said that the farther any one of the equal arcs of the orbit is distant from the sun, so much the feebler is the movement of libration which the planet undergoes; wherefore the more feeble the libration is in one moment of time, in any of the equal arcs of the orbit, so much the longer does the planet revolve and undergo a libration in that arc. Therefore since the feebleness of the forces is balanced by the stretch of time wherein the planet experiences those forces in itself—and this occurs in the same ratio on both sides, namely, in the ratio of the distances from the sun; hence there is the final effect that in the equal arcs of the eccentric circle the quantity (*modulus*) of the forces of libration is disbursed by the sun and is absolutely equal with respect to the sun as an agent. See diagrams on pages 903 and 934.

> Now therefore state the measure of the portion of the quantity of the solar forces which the planet admits into itself in any posture with respect to the sun.

> We must consider the angle which the rays [*radii*] of the sun make with the magnetic threads of the planetary globe. For the sine of the angle complementary to this measures this portion of forces admitted. For since the efficient causes of the libration are the ray of the sun and the magnetic threads of the planet's body, two physical lines, it is right to seek the measure of the strength of the libration from the angle between these lines and from its sine.

> [649] For example, let A be the sun; and I, the centre of the planetary body; RP the line drawn through A the sun and through B the centre of the orbit; EG and IH the magnetic threads will be practically perpendicular to RP—at least if the counterbalancing of the semicircles is considered—and H and F are the solipetal termini. For it was laid down in Book IV, page 935 that during the revolution of the body the magnetic threads stay practically parallel to themselves and at points P and R provide no occasion of attraction or repulsion, because there the positions of both the solipetal and the solifugal termini are equally distant from the sun at A. But in the intermediate positions, where the solipetal or the solifugal termini regard the sun directly, the strength of the libration is greatest of all. AE and AI are the rays of the sun. Let lines ED and IO be drawn parallel to line RP, and let perpendiculars be dropped upon them from points F and C, wherein the rays of the sun cut the middle circles of the planetary globe; and let the perpendiculars be CL and FK. Here the angles made by the rays of the sun with the threads are AEG and AIH; the complementary angles are CED and FIO, or the arcs CD and FO, and CL and FK are the sines of these angles, according as IH or EG is the total sine of 100,000. Therefore it is established that as EG and IH are to LC and KF, so the total quantity of the forces from the sun which are present at I or F is to the portion which the planet admits at the postures of the threads EG and IH.

> Why do you take the sine as the measure, rather than the complement of the angle or arc?

> Because, although any magnetic thread is present in a spherical body, nevertheless it is not a circle, but is a physical straight line; because it works most strongly towards undergoing attraction or is very strongly disposed towards admitting the forces of the solar ray into itself, when it points towards the sun in a straight line; or else—what is the same thing—when it is perpendicular to the plane of illumination of the circle, which bounds the part of the globe which is turned towards the sun; but when [650] it is inclined obliquely to that plane, it is equivalent, as to a shorter line, to the perpendicular drawn from its terminus to that plane. Thus the solar ray, considered with respect to the work of heating, heats most strongly when it strikes a surface at right angles; but when at oblique angles, it warms less, in the measure that the line drawn from the sun perpendicularly to the same plane continued is shorter than the oblique ray.

> The following explanation will be more elegant: If you consider that the whole globe is made up simply of threads, whereof the longest threads are those in the great circle of the globe; and the shorter, those in the latitudinal circles. In this way not only will EG, like be a thread; but also the aforementioned sines LC and KF, which are marked out by the solar ray AE and AI at the termini C and F: those sines are latitudinal threads. Therefore the smaller CL and FK are than GE and HI, so much the less of the forces from the solar ray does any one thread of the whole body admit into itself, on account of the solar ray falling obliquely upon itself. Thus the solar ray, by marking out the latitudinal thread, marks out the sine, which is the measure of the portion of its virtue received into the threads.

> Furthermore, every artificial or natural movement, in which the same or analogous principles concur, is measured out by the sines of the angles; but principally and most clearly, the movement or tendency [*nisus*] of the arms in the balance and in the lever. Accordingly since this libration too takes place between movements which are natural in a wider signification—because the libration power of the solar form is a partaker of dimensions, and somehow, though without matter, corporeal; but the lay-out of the threads in the planet again is corporeal; it is not absurd that this libration too should get the same laws as the balance and the lever. And that is all the more probable in the case of the libration towards the sun, because the progression of the planet in longitude along its orbit, by reason of intensification or remission—i.e., by reason of speed and slowness—obeys the laws of the same balance or lever, as was said in

Book IV, page 887 and 906, and will be made clear below in many ways.

*Compare this speed of libration with the proportions of the balance.*

The line from the sun into the threads is like the haft of the balance, the threads like the arms of the balance; and the regions of the threads like the tray; and the weights in the trays are, in the case of the planet, the attraction towards the sun, or repulsion from the same; and both are of the same family of things. For as the sun attracts the planet, so the Earth attracts bodies, and on account of this attraction, bodies are said to be heavy. But the sun attracts the planet with respect to one region and repels it with respect to the other, and does this with varying intensity; while the Earth attracts weights without any distinction being made as to posture. Accordingly that which in the balance is inequality of weights, in the planet becomes the diversity of posture of the threads with respect to the sun: for here the planet exhibits both weights on the balance as the same weight. And just as in the balance, the heavier weight comes down towards the Earth, and the lighter moves up away from the Earth; so in this case the whole globe of the planet suffers the affect (*affectionem*) of the prevailing region. Hence if the friendly region is more attracted by the sun [than the unfriendly region is repelled], the whole planet approaches the sun; but if the unfriendly region is more repelled, the whole globe of the planet is repelled by the sun. Therefore too the measure, in accordance with which the weights of the balance are at war with one another, will be dominant in the disbursing of this attraction and repulsion. But in the balance the victory of the weights is evaluated at the sine of the complement of the angle between the haft or handle (*manubrium*) and the arm of the lighter weight, as will be proved. Wherefore

too in the libration of the planetary body towards the sun, the passion of the region of thread nearer the sun will overcome the passion of the opposite region in the ratio of the sine of the complement of the angle between the solar ray and the thread. But the effect of victory, in the movement of the planets, is the strength of the libration belonging to each position. Accordingly this strength, or the increment born of that [strength] of libration, will similarly be evaluated at the sine of the complement of the angle with the threads.

Let AD be the handle or haft; and let AB and AC, the arms in the same straight line BC, be each equal to AD. Let H be the lighter weight hanging from B: and I, the heavier weight, hanging from C. Accordingly the weights, which by their power (*potestate*) are at points B and C, have an altitude as great as BC the length of the arms; and the weights contend for this altitude, which is DE. For if the greater weight completely overcame the other, the arm BA would coincide with the handle DA; and the greater weight C would be in the place of altitude E, and would lift the lesser up to D the very top; but because the heavier weight does not overcome the lighter completely, therefore the perpendicular BE drawn from the end of arm B to the handle DA shows that the weight B is lifted through FA, a part of the altitude, and that the weight C goes down the same amount, namely through AG. Accordingly
DF : FE : : weight H : weight I.
FE : FG : : weight I : weight I—weight H.
DE : FG : : DA : FA : : weights I & H : weight I—weight H.

But if BA is set down as the total sine, FA will be the sine of angle FBA, which is the complement of angle FAB.

In the same way if EA is the ray from the sun, BC the magnetic thread of the planetary body, H or B the lesser strength of repulsion, and I or C the greater strength of attraction—because C has approached nearer to the sun than B—then, if BA exhibits the strongest attraction and with no angle BAD, AF will represent the attraction at the existing angle BAF or GAC.

Apply these things to the proportionality of the lever too.

The proportionality [ratio] of the lever is the same, with only the following difference: in the balance the fulcrum A is at the midpoint between B and C the extremities of the arms, and thence the unequal weights make BC not remain parallel to the horizon: but in the lever the line of weights remains parallel to the horizon, while the fulcrum divides the length of the arms not at the midpoint but nearer the heavier weight, so that the arms have the inverse ratio of the weights.

For example, if DA the handle of the balance is equal to the arms BA and AC, a lever will be formed, and the weights hanging from B and C will be suspended at equilibrium with respect to the horizon—as follows: DK the perpendicular drawn from D to BC will be the handle; and BK and KC will be the arms; and as formerly DF was to FE, so now BK is to KC. Then as BK the shorter arm is to KC the longer arm, so the lesser weight H to be suspended from C is to the greater weight I to be suspended from B.

The reader must be warned that mechanical experimentation is difficult: because the weight and thickness of the arms themselves cannot be guarded against mechanically. Now they ought to constitute geometrically a pure line without weight and width. It may be seen in Archimedes how we must meet this hindrance in part.

*I grasp that the measure of the strength, or of the increment of libration, at any given posture of the threads of the planetary body must be sought from the complement of the angle made by the thread with the solar ray; but because it seems that this angle is discovered with difficulty, in that not only is the body continually transported from place to place, but also its threads are deflected; does not this measure seem uncertain and therefore unsuited for use?*

On the contrary, on account of this deflection of the threads, that angle can be converted to the arc of the orbit, so that from this arc will come the same sine, i.e., the same measure, and for this reason that measure is very well adapted to use.

*Teach and demonstrate this converting of the angle to the orbit.*

You remember that at the start when the planet is at the apsides, i.e., at the beginning of the orbit, the angle between the ray of the sun and the thread is a right angle. Again in Book IV, page 941, it was shown that thread AQ of this figure points towards A the sun, or is one with NA the ray from the sun—the angle here being null—when PN a quadrant of the orbit from apsis P has been traversed: hence the arc of the orbit from the apsis measures the complement of this angle. Therefore it remains to be demonstrated, that even the intermediate angles made by the thread and the sun, as HIA, between a right angle and no angle, have as their complements the middle arcs of the orbit, as PI, between no arc and a quadrant, so that the two together make 90°.

It is demonstrated as follows: On page 944, it was said that IS : NB : : angle HIS : angle QNB. That [ratio] is used for the sake of discerning IS and NB, although, by the force of physical speculation, that [ratio] is true of the sines of angles IAP and NAP. But now
sin AIB : sin ANB : : sin IAP : sin NAP.
For
BI : BA : : sin BAI : sin BIA.
And
BI : BA : : BN : BA : : sin BAN : sin BNA.
Therefore
sin BAI : sin BAN : : sin IAP : sin NAP : : sin AIB : sin ANB.
Therefore if the foregoing terms are compared with one another, angle HIS will be found equal to angle AIB, and angle QNB to angle ANB; and, if equals are subtracted [from equals], angle SIB will be equal to angle HIA—just as, by proportion, angle BNB will be equal to angle ANA. But the measure of angle SIB is arc IN, because the measure of angle SBI is arc PI. Therefore too the measure of angle HIA will be arc IN, the complement of arc PI. Therefore, given PI the arc of the orbit, SI the sine of the arc, i.e., the measure of the increment of libration, is also given immediately.

## 2. On the Sum of the Libration Gone Through With

*I comprehend the measure of the increment, or of the strength of libration, at any given moment. But I should like to know the measure of the part of the libration gone through with from the beginning up to that moment.*

That measure is got from the versed sine of the same orbital arc so far traversed. For as the whole major diameter of the ellipse is to the total libration, or—what amounts to the same—as the semidiameter of the orbit is to the eccentricity, so also the versed sine of each arc on the orbit starting from the apsis is to the part of the libration which is gone through with in the meantime, while the planet is traversing that arc.

*By what means is this demonstrated?*

By means of that very measure of the increments of libration which has just now been confirmed by its own demonstration.

For let PD be a perfect circle whose centre is B. Let A be the sun, and PBAR the line of the apsides: and let P and R be the highest and lowest apsides. Let AB be the eccentricity; and let its double, PB, be the total libration. Now let the circle be divided into equal least parts—starting at P. And let the parts be PK, KG, GD, DN, NS and SR. And from these divisions let the perpendiculars KX, GF, DB, NA, and SY be drawn to PR. Therefore, by the foregoing, as the sine KX is to sines GF, DB, NA, SY, and RR—a point instead of a line—so the increments of libration corresponding to arcs PK, KG, etc. are to one another—that is, as PM is to MI, IF, FQ, QV, and VB. And that is true provided it is understood that the division is continued to infinity, when KX and RR are understood to be equal. Therefore since points P, M, I, F, Q, V, and B are put down as separating the said increments of libration; let them be transposed to the different distances of the planet from the sun A: that is to say, with A as centre and with intervals AM, AI, AF, AQ, and AV let the arcs ML, IH, FE, QO, and FT be described in such fashion that a planetary orbit which is an ellipse may be understood to drop from P to R through the points L, H, E, O, and T. The distances of the planet from the sun will be AP, AL, AH, AE, AO, AT, and AR. But the versed sines of the said arcs PK, PG, etc. will be PX, PF, PB, PA, PY, and PR. I say that as the whole diameter PR, the sagitta of arc PDR, is to PB the total libration, so the sagittae of the single arcs are to the single increments of libration, namely so is PX to PM, so PF to PI, so PB to PF, so PA to PQ, so PY to PV.

For it has been put down that PM and PI the parts of the libration are in the ratio of the sines KX, GF, etc. But now also the parts PX, PF, etc. of the total sagitta PR are in the same ratio of the sines KX, GF, etc.—and in the same state of infinite division, where—no less than before—the point R plays the role of line RR.

Therefore, by alternation, the parts of the libration correspond in the same ratio to the parts of the sagitta—and as a consequence, any total portion of the libration from the beginning P corresponds to its total sagitta in the same ratio.

*Whence do we know that the parts PX and XF of the diameter PR, considered as the sagittae, are in the ratio of the sines KX and GF which determine them?*

Pappus made a demonstration. *Mathematical Collections*, Book V. Prop. 36. If a sphere—to be understood by PGZ—is cut by any number whatsoever of parallel planes, as KW, GZ, etc., then the surface of the sphere and the axis of the sections, as PR, are always cut in the same ratio: so that, as the spherical surface KPW is to portion of the axis PX, so too the surface KWZG is to the portion XF, and so for the rest.

But if the spherical surface is understood to be divided into an infinite number of equal zones, then any zone, say KW or GZ, will be as a circle without width. But the circles KXW and GFZ are to one another, with respect to length, as their semidiameters KX, and GF, etc. Wherefore too the corresponding portions of the axis PR, namely PX, XF, will obey the ratio of the sines KX, GF, by which they are determined.

See the *Commentaries on Mars*, Chapter 57, for an attempted demonstration of the same theorem by means of numbers and the sectioning of the circle. But in that place this ratio seemed to be somewhat deficient, because I had not yet read Pappus. But the reason for that was that I did not take the first sagitta from a small enough arc, and that is just as if, in Pappus, you were to divide the spherical surface into parts not smaller than 1° in width. For then the width of the narrowest zone would necessarily be twice that which would be true.

*Although PK, KG, and the remaining arcs taken from the circle are equal, yet it does not seem that PL, LH, etc., the arcs of the true orbit are equal, but are greater towards E. Does not this destroy the certitude of the demonstration?*

Not at all. For the fact that the arcs are greater towards E must be attributed to these very librations, as will be apparent below. But the same thing cannot be either the only cause or a concurrent cause of itself: so that I may pass over the disturbance, because, even if any is to be admitted, it would clearly be imperceptible.

## 3. On the Figure of the Orbit

*I see that the measure of the libration is found in the versed sines of the arcs of the orbit starting from the apsis—by the principles and causes of movement which have been assumed. It is left for you to prove that by this form of libration an elliptic orbit is constituted, concerning which you have said the observations bear witness.*

That the planetary orbit PLHEOTR and the opposite half becomes an ellipse is demonstrated from the properties of this figure which are identical with the properties which the libration so far described exhibits.

*What are the identical properties of the ellipse?*

1. It is clear, from the *Conics* of Apollonius of Perga, that the ellipse around which a circle is circumscribed, with the longer diameter of the ellipse as the common diameter, cuts all the ordinates to that diameter in the same ratio of the segments.

For example, if the lines KX, GF, DB, NA, and SY are ordinates applied to PR, and if the curved line PLHEOTR is an ellipse, then necessarily DB : BE : : GF : FH : : KX : XL : : NA : AO : : SY : YT.

2. The ellipse has two points, from which it is described as from centres; I am accustomed to call these two points the "foci." Accordingly if the lines drawn from the two foci to any point on the ellipse, or even the lines drawn from one focus to the points opposite the centre of the ellipse, are added together, they are always equal to the longer diameter. Hence when they are drawn to those points on the ellipse which are in the shorter diameter lying midway between the vertices, each of them is equal to the semidiameter of the circle.

For example, if A is the focus, B the centre of the circle, AB and BF equal, F will be the other focus. And the sum of AH and HF will be equal to the diameter PR. So will the sum of AL and LF, and the sum of AO and OF. Wherefore, since BE is the shorter semidiameter, and E is the point on it, AE and EF will be equal, and each of them will be equal to the semidiameter BP or BR, or BD.

This is applied to the planets, as follows: we have said that observations bear witness that the planets are at a distance of the semidiameter of the eccentric circle from the sun—one focus of this ellipse—at a time when they have traversed exactly a quadrant of the orbit from apsis P.

*Demonstrate that these properties of an ellipse are exhibited in the planetary orbit which arises from these librations.*

Then, in accordance with the laws so far given, let there be described a new figure, namely, with centre B, the circle PDR, to which the ellipse should be tangent. Let PR be the longer diameter of the ellipse, and on PR let A be a focus, or the place of the sun. Now let DT be drawn through B perpendicular to PR; the shorter diameter will be on DT. And because BA the eccentricity is half of the libration, therefore half the libration has been completed at the completion of the quadrant. Therefore the planet falling upon line DB will be less distant from the sun than at P, and the difference will be equal to BA. Therefore it will have a distance equal to the magnitude PB. Wherefore let an interval equal to DP be extended from A to DP, and let its terminus be E. Therefore the orbit of the planet will cut DB at E.

Again let there be taken PG an arc of the circle, and GFZ its sine or ordinate, and PF the versed sine. Accordingly make BP be to PF as BA half of the libration is to the part [of the libration] belonging to PG. And when that [part of the libration] has been subtracted from AP, let the remainder be extended from A to GF, and let its terminus fall upon H. I say that DB : BE : : GF : FH. For let square GIOF be described on GF, but square HK on HF, so that the gnomon HIK is made. Then let GA and GB be joined; and let the perpendicular AC be drawn to GB continued.

*I say in the first place that the square on AC is equal to the gnomon HIK.*

For
BP : PF : : BA : AP - AH.
Wherefore too
PB : BF : : BA : AH - BP.
But too
PB : BF : : GB : BF : : AB : BC
because the right triangles GFB and ACP have their vertical angles GBF and ABC equal. Therefore
PC = AP - BP.
But too
CG - BP = CG - BG - BC.
Wherefore
GC = -HA.
But
sq. GC + sq. AC = sq. GA.
But on the other hand
sq. AF + sq. FG = sq. GA.
Therefore
sq. GF + sq. FA = sq. GC + sq. CA.
Therefore
(sq. GF + sq. FA) - sq. AH = gnom. HIK,

From this the remainder of the proposed demonstration is easily woven together.

For as one sine GF is to its perpendicular AG, so all the other sines are to their own perpendiculars from A. Therefore as GO the square on the sine is to the square on AG, i.e., to the gnomon HIK, so the squares of all the sines are to their gnomons. Wherefore also, if the gnomons are subtracted, as GO the square of one sine GF is to HK the square on FH—which has been determined by HA the distance of the planet from the sun—so the square on any sine is to the square of its minor determined by its distance. But if the squares are proportional to one another, the sides themselves are proportional to one another. Therefore as GF is to FH, the portion terminated by AH; so any sine, such as DB, is to BE, the portion terminated by AE. And this proportionality [ratio] is true of the ellipse.

The other property of the ellipse is clear of itself.

For in accordance with the rule of the laws of libration, that is, because half of the libration, equal to BA, should be completed in PE a quadrant of the orbit, we extend AF—which is equal to BP the remainder [of the libration]—from A to DB. For, because A is one focus, if the line extended from B along BP is set down equal to BA, the other focus will be marked out: its distance from E will be equal to AF, and the sum of the two focal distances will be equal to the diameter—and that is the case in an ellipse.

*What is the ratio of DE, the width of the crescent cut off by the ellipse from the circle, to the eccentricity BA?*

The eccentricity BA is a mean proportional between DE and ET. In the same way too, every perpendicular, such as AG, is a mean proportional between GH and HZ, the remainder of the chord.

For the rectangle GH, HZ is equal to the gnomon HIK. But this gnomon is equal to the square on AG. Therefore too the rectangle GH, HZ is equal to the same square on AC. Therefore GH, AC, and HZ are in continued proportion.

*What shall I hold concerning the length of this elliptical orbit and of its parts?*

If the figures of the circle and the ellipse are cut by an infinite number of ordinates, GF, DB etc., the first portions ending in P will be—GP will be to PH—as GF is to FH; but the last portions ending in D and E—GD will be to HE—will be equal to one another: so the ratio of DB to BE, which started at P, is gradually obliterated, and at D and E vanishes into the mere ratio of equality. But the total arcs, which started at P, have to one another a ratio compounded of all the ratios of all the least particles; and so they never lay aside completely the full ratio DB to BE. For the quadrant DP is to the quadrant PE, and also the total circular line is to the total elliptical line, as DB is to the arithmetic mean between DB and BE, which is slightly longer than the mean proportional.

*Because use will also be made of the plane of the ellipse, I ask in what ratio will the plane of the ellipse be to the plane of the circle; and hence the plane of any segment of the semicircle to the plane of the segment—of the semiellipse—made by the same ordinate?*

Apollonius demonstrates in his *Conics* that the ratio of the longer diameter to the shorter holds everywhere. Hence if DB and GF are ordinates, as DB is to BE, so is the area of the semicircle PDR to the area of the semiellipse PER; and as GF is to FH, i.e., as DB is to BE, so GPF a segment of the semicircle is to HPF a segment of the semiellipse; and so too GRF a greater segment of the semicircle is to HRF a greater segment of the semiellipse.

Now let the semicircle be cut by the straight line GA, but the semiellipse by the straight line HA; there will be the triangles HAF and GAP having the same altitude PA. Wherefore
base GP : base FH : : area GAP : area HAF.
But
GP : PP : : area GPP : area PPP.
Wherefore
GP : FH : : DB : BE : : comp. area PGA : comp. area PHA.

*Finally I should like to know what ratio the lines from the centre of the figure to the circumference of the ellipse have to the semidiameter of the circle?*

A very small ratio indeed, as BE is less than the semidiameter BD by DE the total width of the crescent. But all the remaining lines, such as BP, have a lesser difference between themselves and the semidiameter BG than at any given place, the width of the crescent, such as GH, is.

For in the triangle GHB, the sum of the two sides GH and BH must exceed the third side GB. Therefore the ratio of the defect at E to the defect at H is greater than the ratio of DE to GH. But this last is the ratio of the sine DB to sine GF. Therefore the ratio of the defect at E to the defect at H is greater than that of sine DB to sine GF.

Conversely, the ratio of the squares on GF and HF is as [some ratio]. But
sq. GF + sq. BF : sq. HF + sq. BF < GF : FH.
Wherefore
side GB : side BH < GF : FH.

Therefore the greater BF is, the more the ratio GB : BH is diminished, so as not to equal the ratio GF : FH. And conversely, the more PF increases, the more the ratio GB : BH increases, approaching the ratio GF : FH. But PF increases slowly from P, but quickly near DB. Therefore if GH everywhere stayed of the same magnitude, it would vary the defect HB slowly around P, quickly around D. But GH does not remain the same, but increases quickly around P, slowly around D—that is, it increases with its sines GF and DB. Again therefore the defect HB increases quickly around P, but slowly around E. Therefore
defect EB : defect BP < sag. PB : sag. PF.
But
arc DP : arc PG > sin DB : sin GF
< sag. BP : sag. FP.
Therefore the ratio of the defect, of lines BP, approaches the ratio of the degrees PG. However, towards D it verges upon the ratio of sine DB to sine GF. But towards P it verges upon the ratio of sagitta BP to sagitta FP.

## 4. On the Measure of Time, or of the Delay made by the Planet in any Arc of its Orbit

*How is the plane of the segment of an ellipse fitted for measuring the delay of the planet in the arc of that segment?*

Not otherwise than if by the division of the circle into equal parts unequal arcs of the ellipse are constituted—small arcs around the apsides, and greater around the mean longitudes—as follows:

With centre B and distance BP, let the circle PDRT be described. Let PBR be its diameter, and on PBR, as on the line of the apsides, let A be the sun, the source of movement, towards R, AB the eccentricity, and BV equal to AB, towards P; so that P and R are the apsides.

Now with the points A and V as the foci, let the ellipse PERI be described, which is tangent to the circle at P and R, and which represents the orbit of the planet. And let EI be the shorter diameter, and DT the diameter of the circle, which are at right angles to PR.

Now let the semicircle PDR be divided into small equal parts, and let P, O, N, D, S, and T be the points between the divisions; and from these points let there be drawn to PR the line of apsides the perpendiculars, such as OM and NK, cutting the ellipse at points C and K. Therefore if the points C, K, E, and I of the sections are joined with A the sun, I say that the delay of the planet in arc PC is measured by the area PCA, the delay in the arc PCK is measured by the area PCKA, the delay in PE is measured by the area PEA, and finally the delay in PER, half of the orbit from apsis P to apsis R, is measured by the area PER, which is half of the total area of the ellipse PERIP.

*Show in what ratio, by means of this sectioning, the mean parts of the planetary orbit are made greater than the parts around the apsides.*

In the ratio of the longer semidiameter to the shorter.

For in the circle let there be the equal parts PO and ND—PO at the apsis P, and ND at the mean longitude D. Therefore, since on the sectioned ellipse the arcs PC and KE correspond to them, it has already been said above that KE is equal to ND—the most minute division being supposed—then KE will also be equal to PO. Moreover, it was said that as OM is to MC, i.e., as PB is to BE, or the longer semidiameter PB to the shorter semidiameter BE, so PO the arc of the circle is to PC the arc of the ellipse; therefore as

PB is to BE, so also will KE the arc of the ellipse at the mean longitude be to PC the arc at the apsis.

What follows from this sectioning of the elliptic orbit into unequal arcs?

It follows that equal areas are assigned to the sum of the [two] smaller orbital arcs taken around both apsides and to the sum of the [two] greater arcs taken around both mean longitudes, as the measures of the delays in those arcs — though nevertheless the sum of the [two] smaller arcs is as equally distant from the sun as the sum of the [two] greater arcs.

For as above let PC and RG be equal. The areas PCB and RGB will also be equal. Again let KE and LI be equal to one another, but greater than the former arcs, as has already been demonstrated: the areas KEB and LIB will also be equal.

But it has already been demonstrated that

PB : BE :: KE : PC

in the given sectioning of the orbit. Accordingly there are the triangles BPC and BEK — rectilinear, or as it were, reciprocal, because as BP the altitude of the first triangle is to BE the altitude of the second, so is KE the base of the second triangle to PC the base of the first triangle.

Wherefore

area BEK = area BPC.

Therefore

area BEK + area BIL = area BPC + area BRG.

But

area BPC + area BRG = area APC + area ARG,

because

alt. CP + alt. RG = alt. AP + alt. AR.

And

area BEK + area BIL = area AEK + area AIL,
because on base PK or on the line touching it at P, the triangles BEK and AEK have the same altitude BE and the same base PK, and on base IL or on the line touching it at I the triangles BIL and AIL have the same altitude BI and the same base IL. Therefore the areas AEK and AIL are assigned to the long arcs KE and LI; and areas APC and ARG, which are equal to them [in sum], are assigned to the shorter arcs PC and PG, since nevertheless the sum of the distances EA and AI from the sun is equal to the sum of the distances PA and AP, as was demonstrated before.

If equal areas are assigned to unequal arcs equally distant from the sun, while the times or delays of unequal arcs equally distant from the sun ought also to be unequal — by the axiom employed above — then how do equal areas measure unequal delays?

Although in this way the pairs of arcs are really unequal to one another, nevertheless they are equivalent [*aequipollent*] to equal arcs in partaking of periodic time.

For it has been said in the above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the most minute equal parts, the delays of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun. But this is to be understood not of all equal parts as such, but principally of those which are opposite the sun in a straight line, as PC and PG, where there are the right angles APG and APG. But in the case of the other parts which face the sun obliquely, this is to be understood only of that which in any of those parts belongs to the movement around the sun. For since the orbit of the planet is eccentric, therefore in order to form it two elements of movement are mingled together — as has been demonstrated already: one element comes from the revolution around the sun by reason of one solar virtue; the other comes from the libration towards the sun by reason of another solar virtue distinct from the first. For example, in arc IL the termini I and L are at unequal distances from A the source of movement; therefore let AL continued to Q as AQ be a mean proportional between AL and AI. And if with centre A and distance AQ the arc QS is described cutting the longer line AI in S, arc QS is of the first element of the composite movement; but the difference between AL and AI, or the sum of LQ and SI, is of the second element of the movement, which must be separated out in mind. For none of the periodic time is due to it, since it [the second element] has already in the above received its own portion under other laws, when it was a question of the libration. But this second element of movement can be separated out in no other way than by this sectioning of the orbit into unequal parts, which we gave above. For the quantity whereby the sum of the arcs KE and LI exceeds the sum of the arcs PC and PG comes wholly from the second element of the movement; and with that excess separated out, there remains of the first element something which is equal to the sum of the arcs PC and PG, which I demonstrate as follows.

For by the above demonstrations, AE and AI are equal to BP and AR. Let arcs [of circles] be described through points E and I, and let the first arc cut away and subtract as much from the area AEK towards K, as the second arc adds to area AIL above L: Hence in this fashion the triangles — or rather sectors — get these new right bases instead of the oblique bases KE and LI: Wherefore if the area equal to the sum of PCB and RGB is applied to AE and AI, the bases or arcs described through E and I are equal to the bases described through P and R. But it was previously demonstrated that

area AEK + area AIL = area PCB + area RGB,

Therefore the sum of the oblique bases KE and LI which has to do with the revolution around the sun is equal to the sum of the arcs PC and PG, where almost no libration with respect to the sun is mixed in with it, because AP and AC are imperceptibly different, like AR and AG.

The same things will also be demonstrated of the other small parts of the orbit: for example, if CF is taken and CB and FB are continued to G and P, and if GH, corresponding to CP, is joined, and the four points are connected with A the source of movement. For it was demonstrated in the above that

CA + AG = PA + AR = PA + AR

and

FA + AH = PA + AR = PA + AR,

Wherefore too, as previously,

area ACP + area AGH = area BCP + area BGH,

and hence

area ACP + area AGH = area APC + area APC,
although by the proportionality of sectioning set up, CP will be slightly longer than PC, and GH longer than RG. For the sum of the new arcs described with centre A and distances AC and AG and cutting AP and AH will be equal to the arcs PC and RG; because the greater the circle of the first arc than the circle of the second arc, the smaller an angle CAP does the first arc measure, and the greater an angle GAH does the second arc measure, so that thus

angle CAP + angle GAH = angle PAC + angle PAG.

Therefore, since the regularity of the first element in the planetary movement, namely the regularity of the progression around the sun, consists in the equality of the angles around the sun, i.e., in the equality of the sum of two angles; and since the area of the ellipse is equally distributed among the arcs which subtend these angles, that is, two areas are always equal to two other areas: therefore rightly — up to now and in so far as we are dealing with pairs of arcs — is the area set up as the measure of time; because the delays of time ought to be equal not to equal arcs as such but to their equal progressions around the sun, at the same distance from the sun.

Then in this way let the area of the ellipse be rightly distributed between the pairs of opposite arcs; now demonstrate that the single triangles are separately the most exact measures of the single delays?

The demonstration is easy by means of the foregoing.

For since by our axiom the delay of the planet in arc PC is to the delay in the equal arc RG, as AP the distance of arc PC from the source of motion is to AR the distance of arc RG; but since also the area of triangle PCA is to the area of triangle RGA — which has its base RG equal to PC the base of the first triangle — as PA the altitude of triangle PCA is to RA the altitude of triangle RGA: Wherefore the delay of the planet in arc PC is to the delay in the equal arc RG as the area of triangle PCA is to the area of triangle RGA.

In the same way it will be demonstrated that the delay of the planet in CF — which is equal in power (*potestate*) to CP — is to the delay of the same in GH, as the area ACF is to the area AGH — where the sum of each pair of areas is equal to the sum of the [two] prior areas, and so on in order. Therefore the total area of the ellipse — which has been cut up at A into triangles — is distributed among the arcs in the same proportion wherein the total periodic time has been distributed among them. Therefore the single triangles are proportionally the most exact measures of their single arcs.

A demonstration of this full equivalence is given in my *Commentaries on Mars*, Chapter 59, page 291. On that page at the line *Apsis longiorem*, one word, *erit*, has brought in great obscurity; and if you change it to *computaretur*, everything will be clearer. Although I confess that the thing is given rather obscurely there, and most of the trouble comes from the fact that there the distances are not considered as triangles, but as numbers and lines.

### 5. On the Equivalence of the Circular Plane and the Plane of the Ellipse in Measuring the Delays in the Arcs

Does it not seem to be a hard, unaccustomed, not to say complicated, job for the calculator to be reduced to using the plane of the ellipse in computing the time?

On the contrary, in the opinion of all the job becomes easier by the employment of the elliptical plane instead of the circular; so much so that the ancient calculus is by no means to be compared to this new one for ease.

Demonstrate the equivalence of the planes with respect to measuring time.

Then let there be repeated the figure exhibited on page 978 where we demonstrated the generation of the plane of the ellipse.

And because it has already been demonstrated that as half of the periodic time — wherein the planet traverses PER half of the orbit — is to the time which the planet spends in PH or in PE, precisely so is the area PER to the area PHA or PEA. But it was also demonstrated above that

PDR : PER :: PGA : PHA :: PDA : PEA.

For they all have the same ratio as DB to BE. And thus too, by alternation, as the area PER is to PHA or to PEA, so the area PDR is to PGA or to PDA. Therefore as half the periodic time of arc PER is to the time of arc PH or PE, so the area PDR is to PGA or PDA. Wherefore in these segments of the semicircular plane there is found a very exact measure of the delays which the planet makes in any given arc of the ellipse.

Now also show the convenience of this measuring.

Let the segment PGA be taken, and let a straight line be drawn from G to the centre B. Therefore the ratio of the sector GBP to the whole plane of the circle is given by the given magnitude of the arc PG — so that there is no need of computation. For the total periodic time and the total plane of the circle are divided into 360° — astronomical fashion. Therefore GBA the other part of the segment is left. But the computation of it is easy. For as DB the total sine is to GF the sine of the given arc PG, so is area DBA to area GBA. Therefore once the area of the great triangle DBA has been determined, that is, by the multiplication of half the eccentricity by the total sine and by the conversion of the result into astronomical terms, it will ever afterwards be useful.

Does not the circular plane have some other further use?

In the schema of the moon there is a special use of it in demonstrating one of its irregularities, which the moon possesses uniquely, in contrast to all the other planets. But because this Fifth Book is given over only to those properties which are common to all the planets; therefore what remains of the geometrical apparatus for carrying out the demonstration of this special use is rightly postponed to Book VI, Part IV, i.e., to the schema of the moon.

In what way does the old Ptolemaic astronomy measure the delays of the planet in any arc of its eccentric circle, or what does it have instead of the circular plane?

For this it uses a special circle, which has the name of “equant,” of which the centre would in our figures be the other focus — in the last diagram, F, in the next to the last, V; because the other focus is as far distant, towards P the highest apsis, from B the centre of the eccentric circle, as A the sun, towards R the lowest apsis, is distant from the same centre of the eccentric circle. For if a line is drawn from V the centre of the equant through the body of the planet, the arc of the equant intercepted between this line and VP the line of the apsides is set down as the measure of the time which the planet spends in the arc of its orbit.

This hypothesis seems to be more convenient for manual representations by means of the instruments called *schemata*: why do you not keep it, since you have already twice employed substitute quantities in place of the true?

1.  Because the equant never says the truth perfectly, unless we wish to give its centre an irregular movement of libration. And in that way we should draw away from simplicity of hypotheses, and set up an astronomy which is more complicated and laborious in practice than the astronomy of these two books, the fourth and fifth, in the explanation of causes. And with these causes once perceived, and not even believed in but merely laid down, practice afterwards becomes easy in the second part of Book V and in Book VI.
2.  Because in Ptolemy the proportionality (*ratio*) of this equant is one thing in the higher planets, something else in the two lower planets, something else in the moon, and now it would be something else again in the sun. But for us the plane of the eccentric circle serves the same use in the same way in all the planets.
3.  Because the equant circle is very distant from the true causes of the movements. And the plane of the [eccentric] circle represents these causes very closely, because it is of the same family as the plane of the ellipse.

Let it be understood that the same things are spoken against other equivalences, which the wonderful force of human ingenuity is accustomed to bring forward: for example, by means of a single libration of the centre of the eccentric circle in the shorter diameter of our ellipse — although the libration needs the contrary motions of two equal circles — David Fabricius both saves the movements inward of the planet away from the sides (*a lateribus*) of our immovable eccentric circle and at the same time gives the apsis a movement of libration — so that now, by means of numbering continued from the apsis, which has the libration, to the planetary body, the eccentric circle itself furnishes us with a measure of time. For neither absolute regularity of movements nor perfect precision is obtained, nor is there a curtailment of labour. And the causes of the movements are hidden and denied.

But I absolutely reject the Copernican machinery, which makes two epicycles having the ratio of one to two in their movements revolve on a concentric circle. For observations bear witness that at the mean positions between the apsides the planet moves inward towards the sides. But this Copernican hypothesis by a contrary proportionality [*ratione*] makes it wander outward.[^1] These small parts of the Copernican hypotheses must be completely corrected. But his general hypothesis of the annual movement of the Earth must be saved, whence the name of this teaching comes.

### 6. On the Regularity of the Digressions in Latitude

The calculus of latitude is not certain, is it, if there are no solid spheres, even though special threads in the planetary body take their place?

If we lay down those things which were laid down in Book IV, page 948, and which are absolutely possible and concordant, then it is absolutely necessary for the perfect plane of an ellipse to arise.

For in this diagram let TZX be a circle through the poles of the ellipse. Either let A be the sun, if TZX is a plane; or, if TAX is a hemisphere, let A first be the position, on the concave surface, of the lower intersection of the ellipse TX and EG the orbit of the planet, — so that the poles of the orbit are at Z and W. Let the threads of latitude point along GA [*dirigantur secundum GA*]; and let them have the faculty of deflecting the movement XAT given by the sun, through the angle GAX; and during the whole circuit let the threads remain parallel. It is clear that while the planet is turning at A the lower section, the threads stretched along GA will direct the planet according to the total angle, and the planet will come in a perfect plane as far as G, by ascending up to the plane drawn through the poles. And because now the thread at G points towards the sun A and not crosswise over the ecliptic; accordingly here the planet will not digress any farther, but G will be the limit: thence, gradually raised up above the plane ZXW, the planet will direct its thread along the line drawn from intersection A through the sun A, until the planet comes to A, now the upper intersection on the convex surface. Therefore just as at A there is the greatest angle of inclination of the thread with the ecliptic TX, and the angle decreases rapidly; but at G and E there is no angle of inclination of the thread with the plane [*longitudinem*] of the ecliptic, and this smallness of inclination lasts a long time; so too if out of the circuit EAG there is made a perfect plane, its parts at A have their greatest inclination with the ecliptic TX, and the inclination decreases quickly. But around G and E the rim of the plane — which is understood to stretch downward into the depth of the sphere or upward — extends for a long time approximately parallel to the plane of the ecliptic. Therefore if instead of the operation of the thread we employ the product itself, that is, EAG, as a perfect plane, the calculus will be absolutely consonant with the principles.

### Conclusion of the First Part of Book V

Then let what has been written so far be done for geometers endowed with a keen mind, who do not think it right to admit into their calculus that which has not been confirmed by a very accurate demonstration and deduced from the natural principles of the movements.

## Part Two
### On the Astronomical Terms Arising from Calculations and the Eccentric Orbit

How is the orbit of any planet called?

It is called by the ancient name of “eccentric,” sc. circle. For even if the orbits are elliptical, as PERI here, and have as it were two centres, A and L, which, in physical language, we call the “hearths” or “foci,” and the sun itself, as centre of the world, is situated at one of those foci; nevertheless also the point midway between the foci, as B, is with peculiar rightness called the “centre” by writers on conics. And furthermore, for the sake of measurement, a perfect circle PDR having its centre B distinct from A the centre of the world is circumscribed around the figure.

In astronomy, what name does PR the longer diameter of the ellipse have?

It is called the “line of apsides,” because, since it is drawn through A the centre of the world and B the centre of the orbit, its sections with the orbit designate P the highest apsis and R the lowest.

Why are they called the highest apsis and the lowest, and what other name do they have?

The word “*apsis*” is taken from wheels; for the *apsides* are points on the eccentric, P the farthest away from A the sun and R the nearest to it. But in geometry the explanation of the meaning is clearer. For the word “*apsis*” is derived from “being tangent”; and indeed in points P and R the director circle is tangent to the elliptic orbit. The Latin translations of Arabian books express the Greek words “*apsis*,” “*apsides*” by the words “*aux*,” “*auges*” — as if the Arabs had changed the Greek Psi to Xi. However some one who boasts a knowledge of the Arabic language asserted to me that the word “*augh*” signifies altitude.

Book VI will call those points the “aphelion” and the “perihelion,” in the case of the primary planets; and in the case of the moon, the “apogee” and the “perigee.”

What necessity compels us to suppose, instead of the circular route of the planet believed in by the ancients, an elliptical route, i.e., one falling away from the circle, and to set up in it a longer diameter and on that longer diameter the sun?

Both of them are demonstrated from the observations and by means of a very sure demonstration in the *Commentaries on the Movements of the Planet Mars*, and they are employed in Book IV on page 862 in the diagrams and on pages 910 and 932 and 933, and also in the first part of Book V. Therefore, unless we made these hypotheses, we should never represent the observations.

By what names do we distinguish from one another the semicircles into which the line of apsides divides the eccentric?

The one half, PER or PDR, is called the descending or the prior semicircle; the other, RIP or RTP, the ascending or posterior.

What is eccentricity?

In Greek, *ἐκκεντρότης* is the line joining A the centre of the world, or of the body around which the movement is arranged, and B the centre of the eccentric — namely AB, part of the line of apsides PR.

What is the name of the lines drawn to the eccentric orbit from the centre of the body around which the movement is arranged?

In Greek, they are called *ἀποστήματα*; as latinized, “intervals” or “distances”; in translations from the Arabic, “elongations” — for example, AP, AC, AE, AM, AS, AF, AR, AN, AQ, etc.

Which among these elongations are the more important?

AP, the longer elongation, in Arabic, or the aphelial or apogeal distance; AR, the shorter elongation or perihelial distance or perigeal distance, in the case of the moon; and the mean elongation, which is the arithmetic mean between the longer and shorter elongation: the one which is in the descending semicircle, namely AE, is called the first mean elongation, and the one in the ascending semicircle, such as AI, the second.

What else does “mean elongation” signify?

By metonymy, it is used for those points on the orbit which are at a mean distance from the sun, such as E and I, namely those points which are at a distance of a quadrant or 90° before or after the apsides. And sometimes it is also used for the point in the zodiac which is 90° distant before or after the position in the zodiac on which the extension of the line of apsides falls.

Here we must note emphatically that it is not the extension of line AP of the same name which falls upon this degree of the ecliptic called the mean elongation, but rather line BE from the centre, or its parallel, AM — as being lines which make right angles with PR the lines of apsides.

What is the name for the difference between the mean elongation or distance and any other whatsoever?

This difference is called the “libration” of the planet, because the total libration, as in the movement of the trays of the balance, is slow in the beginning, when the planet is at its greatest distance from the sun, and in the end, when the planet is nearest the sun; it is fast in the middle.

In the diagram, since AP is the longest distance, and AR the shortest, then let AR be transposed to line AP and extended from A to G, so that the total libration can be laid before the eyes in a single line AP which is as it were at rest; the total libration will be PG, twice the eccentricity BA. Accordingly this libration is slow around P and G, namely when the planet is either in P or in R, fast around B, when the planet or line AH has been transferred to line AE or AI.

You have said that a circle is circumscribed around the orbit for the sake of measurement. State in how many ways this circle conduces towards the measurement of that orbit.

Four ways: (1) This circle designates and divides the arcs of the elliptic orbit. For example, arc PC receives its name and specification from arc PK. (2) The circle gives the measures of the librations of the planet and thus determines the lengths of the intervals between the planet and the sun. For example, AC or AO is determined by arc PK or its complement KD, because arc PK gives the magnitude of the libration HO which must be added to the semidiameter AH. (3) The circle exhibits also the measure of the time which the planet spends in any arc of its elliptic orbit. For example, we learn through arc PK how long the planet moves in arc PC. (4) When those things have been found, we can also investigate the angle at the sun subtended by the arc of the orbit. For example, if arc PK is not known, if line AC is unknown, angle CAP cannot be found.

### 1. Concerning Designation

In what way does the circle designate and divide the arcs of the ellipse, and by what means, and wherefore?

Since the circumference of an ellipse cannot be divided geometrically into equal parts, nor can parts into which it has been divided be designated from their number: therefore, in place of the ellipse, the circle is divided into equal parts — starting from the apsides, and from the points of division perpendiculars cutting the ellipse are drawn to the line of apsides. Therefore the arc of the circle between the aphelion and any perpendicular whatsoever supplies the name for the arc of the ellipse intercepted between the same limits and applies its number of degrees and minutes to that arc.

Let arc PK be 50°0', and KL cutting the ellipse in C perpendicular to PR. Therefore too PC the arc of the ellipse is said to be 50°0'.

But the name is untrue, since the arc of the ellipse is not so great — neither with reference to the circle nor with reference to the total elliptic orbit.

This causes no trouble, for there is no question of anything at present except the name; and the name is not the name of the apparent measure, but of the geometrical determination and division. And there is no need to know the true length of the arc of the ellipse as if measured with a yardstick, provided we may afterwards learn how great an angle is made at the centre of the sun

[^1]: See *Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*, Book V, Chapter IV.

## 1. Concerning Perpendiculars

by the arc of the ellipse so determined and how long the planet delays in that arc. As a matter of fact, in the first part of Book V, I demonstrate that this arc of the ellipse is as great, if not in length, at least in power.

How are these perpendiculars called which cut the ellipse?

In the circle, they are called the sines of the arcs of the circle which begin at the aphelion; in the ellipse, they are generically called ordinates, viz., to the axis. For example, here KL is the sine of arc KP. CL is the ordinate.

But specifically, that which is drawn through the centre of the figure — as EBI — is called the shorter diameter or minor axis of the figure. We can employ the Greek term *miacentre*. Finally, the perpendicular, such as MAN, which passes through the centre of the sun is without a name, although it is among the principal ones. Let it be called by the new name “dihelion.”

Now what is the function of those two perpendiculars — the diacentre and the dihelion?

They divide the orbit into upper and lower parts: the diacentre, into parts which are equal but unequal in respect to time and apparent movement; the dihelion, into parts which are [682] unequal both in time and in length but which nonetheless appear equal as it were from the sun.

For example, EPI which is constituted by EBI is 180°, but it appears to be less than 180° by angle EAI. But the greater segment MPN cut off by line MAN and MRN the lesser segment both appear equal in magnitude to 180°.

## 2. Concerning Libration

Tell how to measure and compute the librations and how to determine the intervals.

Let PK be an arc of the eccentric less than 90°, for example, 46°18'51"; therefore KD its complement will be 43°41'9", and BL its sine, .69070; and let eccentricity AB or half libration PH be 9.265, whereof BP is 100.000. Therefore

9.265 × .69070 = 6.399,

if the last five decimals are ignored; and hence the libration OH will be 6.399, which is to be added to BP or AH in the upper semicircle; and AO or its equal AC, namely the distance of the planet from the sun, will be 106.399 (whereof the semidiameter is 100.000) which goes with arc PK or PC.

But if the arc of the eccentric is 313°41'9", the excess over and above three quadrants or 270° will also be 43°41'9", which gives the same sine as a multiplicand. Hence when the libration of 6.399 is produced, that same number is to be added to the upper semicircle which is an ascending semicircle.

But if the semidiameter BP receives a different mensuration, for example, 152.342, we shall multiply BP by the 1.06399 of AC and (if the last five decimal places are ignored) AC will be 162.090 at this distance.

By means of Napier's invention, this whole operation is finished most expeditiously in a single addition. For the logarithm of the sine of arc KD is added to the logarithms of 9.265 the eccentricity and of 152.343 the mensuration proposed; and the sum produced as a logarithm will give a libration of 9.748 to be added to the distance 152.342.

[683] So next, if arc PW is greater than 90°, viz., 133°39'7"; DW its excess over and above 90° is 43°39'7", and its sine or logarithm, together with the two aforesaid beginnings, will give a libration of 9.777 to be subtracted from 152.342, as in the semicircle below the diacentre: hence the corresponding interval AS will be 142.565.

The same thing will hold, if the arc of the eccentric is 226°20'53". For its complement with respect to 270° will be 43°39'7" — as great in the ascending semicircle as was DW in the descending semicircle.

Review the principal moments in the libration.

1. When the planet begins to move away from the apsis, then simultaneously the libration commences — that is, the planet, which had just before finished its ascent away from the sun, begins to descend towards the sun.

2. When the planet is 60° away from the apsis, then the libration is equal to half the eccentricity.

3. When the planet has traversed 90° of the orbit from the apsis, then half of the libration has been completed, so that the planet is at a distance from the sun of a semidiameter of the eccentric. For example, if PD is 90°, then AE equals BD.

4. When the planet has traversed 120° from the apsis, three quarters of the libration have been completed.

5. When the planet is at the lowest apsis, then it is nearest to the sun and has completed the total libration. The order through the ascending semicircle is the reverse.

6. If the planet has traversed equal arcs on the eccentric, on one occasion from the aphelion, on the other occasion from the perihelion, then the sum of those two distances from the sun is equal to the diameter. For example, if a straight line is drawn from B to Q, then the sum of CA and AQ is equal to RP.

## 3. Concerning the Delay of the Planet in Any Arc

What does the word anomaly mean?

Although, properly speaking, anomaly — irregularity — is an effect of the movement of the planet, nevertheless astronomers employ this [684] word for the very movement in which the irregularity is present. And since the following three measurable things come together in the movement: the space to be traversed, the temporal delay in the space, and the apparent magnitude of the space; the word "anomaly" is to be applied to all three. And again, with reference to time, the use of the word is twofold. For, primo, Ptolemy employs it for the total time which the planet spends while its total irregularity returns to its starting point, and he counts as many anomalies as there are periodic returns such as these.

Secundo, parts of this total time are commonly called anomalies, according as Ptolemy said a movement was a complete part of the full anomaly.

Then how many anomalies are there as parts of a whole?

Three anomalies are denominated in any position of the planet whatsoever: (1) mean anomaly; (2) anomaly of the eccentric; and (3) the corrected anomaly.

What is the mean anomaly?

It is the interval of time which the planet spends in any arc of its orbit — beginning at the apsis: this interval is reduced to degrees and minutes, whereof the total anomaly is equivalent to 360° by mathematical or astronomical enumeration.

Why is it called mean?

Not from being, as it were, a mean proportional between its related anomalies, as will be remarked a little later; but it is called mean in imitation of the ancient astronomy which usually speaks of the mean anomaly instead of the mean — i.e., uniform — movement of anomaly, because the time thus reduced to mathematical terms indicates, by means of the number of degrees and minutes, how great an arc of its circle the planet would have been going to traverse, if during that whole time which we call the mean anomaly it had moved in a uniform movement which was a mean between the slowest and the fastest movement.

How should the mean anomaly be determined or measured in these diagrams according to the ancient astronomy?

If the distance BL equal to the eccentricity is marked off in the line of apsides BPY as was said in Part I of Book V; the mean anomaly, according to the ancient astronomy, would be the arc of the equant circle described around L — the arc which progresses eastwards and is intercepted by two lines drawn from L, the one through apsis P and the other through the planetary body C. Or it would be the angle between those lines at L, or the difference between that angle and 360°. For example, in this case if C were the planet, then angle PLC could be used instead of the mean anomaly approximately.

Define the line of mean movement and the mean position of the planet, according to this ancient hypothesis of the equant.

It would be the line drawn from the centre of the sun to the sphere of the fixed stars parallel to the line which has been drawn from the centre of the equant, or from the other focus of the ellipse, through the planetary body. And either one of these lines in the sphere of the fixed stars would indicate the mean position of the planet. In the diagram, if C were the planet and AM were parallel to LC, then AM would be the line of its mean movement.

If therefore in this new formulation of astronomy, no equant circle is expressed, then in terms of what other magnitude will the mean anomaly be computed or measured?

In terms of the area comprehended between the arc of the circle which designates and determines the proposed arc of the orbit and between the two straight lines which connect the extremities of the arc with the centre of the sun. For example, if the proposed position of the planet is C, then if a line be drawn from C perpendicular to PR which will cut circle PD in K, and if PA and KA are joined, area PKA is the measure of the mean anomaly, whereof the area of the whole circle is equivalent to 360°.

[686] Tell how to compute the mean anomaly or the amount of time which the planet spends in the proposed arc.

Again, let eccentricity AB be 9.265, whereof the semidiameter BP is 100.000. First of all, we must take the area of the greatest triangle which has a right angle at B and an altitude BD. The multiplication of this area by half AB will give a product of 4632.50000. The value of this area DAB is to be expressed by the number of seconds, whereof the total area of the circle PDT is 360° or 21,600' or 1,296,000". Therefore, since if BP is 100.000, the area of the circle by calculation is 314,159.26536, area DAB is 19,110".

Now let arc PC be given by arc PK which designates it; and let it be 46°18'51". Therefore the sine of PK, namely KL the altitude of triangle BKA, multiplied by the value of the greatest triangle — and the last five decimals cut off from the product — will give triangle AKB a value of 3,819", which is 3°50'19". But sector KBP is equal in value to the number of degrees which have been given in arc PK, namely 46°18'51". Therefore by the addition of the areas, PKA is 50°9'10", and the mean anomaly is of that magnitude.

In this way, the area of the addito-subtractive triangle (triangulum aequatorium) is to be added, as long as the sector or arc is smaller than a semicircle; but if the arc is greater than a semicircle, the area is to be subtracted.

State the rule for the relation between these triangles.

Any two triangles equally distant from the vertices, the one from the highest apsis, and the other from the lowest apsis, are of equal magnitude. For example, if arcs PK and RW are equal, areas BKA and BWA will also be equal.

What is the anomaly of the eccentric?

It is the arc of the eccentric circle measured eastwards and intercepted between the line of apsides and the perpendicular drawn to that line through the planetary or through any proposed [687] point on the orbit. For example, with C as the proposed point on the orbit or with the planet revolving at that point, if through C perpendicular to PAR line KCL is drawn cutting the circle in K, arc PK will be the anomaly of the eccentric.

In what sense is anomaly of the eccentric used?

Here too the phrase “of movement” is understood [between “anomaly” and “of the eccentric”]. For although, according to the figure, in arc PK of the circle no irregularity or anomaly is apparent: nevertheless the movement of the planet in orbit PC is truly anomalous or irregular in three respects: first, by reason of its elliptic figure which bends with unequal curvature according to the difference of its parts and is unequally distant from the centre of the figure; second, by reason of its speed, which is not the same in all parts of its orbit; thirdly, by reason of its apparent movement as seen from the sun, because equal parts of the orbit subtend unequal angles at the sun. Therefore since the arc PK concurs in all those determinations, as has been said: wherefore with the same right wherewith the ancient astronomy introduced the equant circle and by means of that computed the mean anomaly, we ourselves circumscribe an eccentric circle PK around the real orbit PC and by means of that compute the anomaly of the eccentric, employing something uniform in measuring that which is not uniform.

And indeed in the ancient astronomy the equant circle seduced the physicists into imagining that either the circle or at any rate the movement was real: but here no one can be seduced, since it is apparent to the eyes that PC the true orbit of the planet coincides with this artificial circle PK only in the two points P and R, the apsides, and throughout the remaining tract it betakes itself, within the embrace of the eccentric, towards the centre of the figure.

What is the corrected anomaly?

It is the arc of the great circle in the plane of the ecliptic which is marked out by the continuation of the plane of the planetary orbit: this arc is measured eastwards from the position of the apsis to the very position of the planet or the apparent position of any other point on the orbit. Or — which amounts to the same thing — it is the angle which any arc of the true planetary orbit subtends or which is formed by the two aforesaid lines at the centre of the sun, or the difference between that angle and 360°.

For example, if the planet is in C, the corrected anomaly is angle PAC. And if the planet is at Q, then the corrected anomaly is made up of the two right angles PAM and MAR and also angle RAQ. But if with centre A a circle of any magnitude whatsoever be described, and thus even a circle in the sphere of the fixed stars, the arc of this circle measured eastwards from AP as far as AC or continued to AC will also be called the corrected anomaly.

Why is it called “corrected” (*coaequata*)?

Practitioners used to call it the corrected movement of anomaly or simply the corrected anomaly, not as if the irregular movement assumed had been corrected in such a way as to become a regular (*aequalis*) movement, but with a plainly contrary meaning: Now since in the beginning a time or portion of the periodic time is laid down, and since this time, as reduced to astronomical terms, indicates how great an arc of its circle the planet would have been going to traverse within this interval of time, if it had been moving with a uniform movement: so it is the office of the astronomer to show how much of the really irregular apparent movement of the planet corresponds to this time and this fictitious uniform movement. Therefore “corrected movement” means the same thing as movement to which an addito-subtraction has been applied and which has been converted to an apparent movement, namely by putting on the irregularity which the appearances introduce into it: on account of this irregularity the total period is called the anomaly.

Therefore since you have distinguished these three anomalies and formulated them by means of a fictitious eccentric circle circumscribed around the orbit: I ask whether the true orbit of the planet could not be put to the same use.

Although there is no need, nevertheless that is possible on account of their equipollence. For, as has been said in Book V, Part I, the area PCA measures the time and hence the mean anomaly; and anyone who wishes can understand the anomaly of the eccentric circle also by arc PC. But angle PAC has even before this been called the corrected anomaly.

How are these three related anomalies distinguished in magnitude?

The number of degrees and minutes of the anomaly of the eccentric is always a mean between the others. But before a semicircle has been completed, the so-called mean anomaly is always the greatest of the three, and the corrected, the least; but after the semicircle, the so-called mean is the least in magnitude and the corrected the greatest.

---

## 4. Concerning the Angle at the Sun

Tell how to compute the corrected anomaly or the angle at the sun.

There are various modes; but the most compendious is the one which [690] employs the interval between the planet and the sun. For we need that for other uses too.

Now there are three cases of this mode. For either the planet is above the diacentre, or below the dihelion, or between the diacentre and the dihelion.

1. Therefore first let the planet be above the diacentre DBT, viz., in C; and let PK the anomaly of the eccentric be 47°42'20", and let LB the sine of its complement KD be .67277, so that the libration of the planet will be 6.233. By the addition of 6.233 to BP let AC the interval between the planet and the sun be exactly 106.233 in terms whereof BP is 100.000. Accordingly let this same LB the sine of the complement be added to the 9.265 of eccentricity BA, in such fashion that LA the other side of right triangle CAL is 76.542. Accordingly if LA is divided by CA and five ciphers are added, the quotient of 72.051 as a sine shows the arc to be 46°5'48", which is equal to angle LCA, whereof the complement, which is 43°54'12", is the required angle LAC or PAC.

If you subtract the logarithm of half the divisor from the logarithm of half the dividend, the logarithm of the same sine or arc remains.

2. Secondly, let the planet be below the dihelion MAN, viz., in S, and let PW be the anomaly of the eccentric and DW its excess over and above 90°. Accordingly in the same way as above, the libration found by means of BZ the sine of that arc is to be subtracted from the radius, so that the exact interval AS may be manifest. So too the eccentricity BA is now to be subtracted from sine BZ, so that AZ the other side of the right triangle remains. Then once more, if the number of side AZ — to which five ciphers have been added — is divided by side AS, the quotient will be the sine of angle ASZ, to which angle MAS is equal, which is the excess of the required angle PAS over and above angle PAM which is right or 90°.

3. Thirdly, let the planet be between DBT and MAN. Accordingly let PX be the anomaly of the eccentric and DX its excess over and above 90°, and BY the sine whereby the subtractive libration is computed, since the sine lies below B. But since the sine is less than eccentricity BA, it is to be subtracted from this eccentricity, so that YA remains. Accordingly we must operate on YA and on the exact interval, as in the first case.

[691] What do you call the eccentric position of the planet?

That point in the zodiac on which there falls the straight line drawn from the centre of the sun through the planetary body.

What is the equalization (aequatio) or *prosthaphaeresis*, and what is the reason for the name?

It is the difference between the number of degrees and minutes of the mean anomaly and the degrees and minutes of the corrected anomaly. Or, according to the old astronomical formulation, it is the angle at the centre of the sun and its measure, the arc of the great circle in the sphere of the fixed stars intercepted between the lines of the mean and of the apparent movement of the planet. Now since in one semicircle this angle is to be subtracted [from the mean movement] and in the other semicircle it is to be added to the mean movement, so that the movement may be corrected: hence it has been called by the compound name “addito-subtraction” (additio-subtractio). But it has been called the “equalization” because by its addition to, or subtraction from, the corrected anomaly, which divides unequal arcs and times into equal portions, there comes to be the mean and uniform anomaly.

By what epithet or title is the addito-subtraction called?

By two words or their index letters or syllables: A., add., additive; S., sub., subtractive.

How many parts are there to the addito-subtraction and what is the measure of each?

There are two parts, the one physical, and the other optical, to the aforesaid addito-subtraction. For the physical part is due to the irregularity which really accedes to the planetary movement on account of physical causes. But the optical part is due to an irregularity which is merely apparent or as it were apparent, i.e., on account of the greater or less distance between the arc of the orbit and the sun. Both parts are somehow distinguished in the same triangle, which is hence called addito-subtractive (aequatorium).

For if A and B the termini of the eccentricity are joined to [692] the planetary body C, the physical part of the addito-subtraction finds its measure in area BAC — or by equipollence, in area BKA — while the optical part of the addito-subtraction would be equal to angle BCA, if that were computed: angle BKA which is easier to compute, is always slightly less than angle BCA.

What use is there for this addito-subtraction?

In this formulation of astronomy made new, there is no necessary or very great need of the total addito-subtraction composed of both elements. For the anomalies are not determined through this addito-subtraction; but on the contrary through the comparison of the corrected anomaly — which we first compute — with the mean anomaly, we elicit the addito-subtraction, if at any time we wish to use it.

But three distinct anomalies are laid down in the tables. For, first, the anomaly of the eccentric is placed on the left, according to the order of the whole degrees, from 1° to 180°; and that is done [693] because the anomaly of the eccentric being given becomes the starting-point for computing the others, and also the distance or interval between the planet and the sun. Secondly, there is found under the same head and as corresponding to this anomaly of the eccentric, the physical part of the addito-subtraction or the value of the area of the addito-subtractive triangle in degrees and minutes and seconds: and from this inclusion of the anomaly of the eccentric together with the physical part of the addito-subtraction beneath the same head, we understand that the sum of the two constitutes the corresponding mean anomaly. Thirdly, to the right of this and in a separate column is placed the corrected anomaly corresponding to the arc. If anyone now wishes to learn the composite addito-subtraction, let him subtract the corrected anomaly from the mean anomaly found next to it or from the sum of the anomaly of the eccentric and the physical part of the addito-subtraction; and the remainder will be the required addito-subtraction, which in the descending semicircle is called subtractive, and in the ascending, additive.

Nevertheless state how these parts of the addito-subtraction are related, if they are compared with one another.

The smaller the eccentricity, the nearer they approach to equality: in the upper semicircle however, above the diacentre, the optical part is slightly smaller than the physical part; but in the lower semicircle, below the diacentre, it is slightly greater.

For example, in the accompanying diagram, let A be the sun and PAR the line of apsides, and DBT and MAN are at right angles to PAR; and DPT the upper semicircle, or so to speak, and DRT the lower semicircle. In the upper semicircle let the addito-subtractive triangles be BCA and BFA, and BSA and BQA in the lower. Therefore since the areas of the triangles are the measure of the physical part of the addito-subtraction, while the angles at C, F, S and Q are the measure of the optical part: then surely the upper areas are greater parts, while the lower areas are lesser parts, of the area of 360° of the total circle than those angles of theirs are of four right angles or 360°. For the centres C and S and CB and SB as the lengths of the semidiameters, let there be described the arc BL ending at CA and the arc BH ending at SA continued: these arcs measure angles C and S. But areas CBL and SBH are equivalent to these same arcs. Therefore if these areas were the optical [694] parts of the addito-subtractions, the two parts of one addito-subtraction would be equal. But not CBL but the greater area CBA is the measure of the optical part; and thus, in the lower semicircle, not SBH but the smaller area SBA in the lower. Therefore in the upper semicircle the physical part exceeds, and the optical part in the lower.

Where is the composite addito-subtraction greatest?

Of the parts, the prior one, the physical, is greatest at D and T, the extremities of the diacentre, because the altitude of no triangle can be greater than BD or BT, which is the semidiameter in the circle and even in the ellipse, the longest of the ordinates. The posterior part, the optical, would be greatest, if the orbit were circular, at M and N the extremities of the dihelion: for there the line drawn from centre B perpendicular to the straight line MA would be the longest, but that line is the sine of angle BMA the optical part, whereof BM is the sine of the total addito-subtraction. For upon EA, a higher line, there falls from B a shorter perpendicular than BA.

But because the orbit of the planet is elliptical, accordingly the optical part of the addito-subtraction is [695] greatest between M and E, and thus between N and T.

For, first, angle BMA is greater than angle ADB because both are right triangles upon the same base, but altitude DB is greater than altitude MA, namely the shorter diameter is greater than any other ordinate whatsoever. Second, if points B and E are marked at the centres of arcs DM and TN or thereabouts, angles AEB and AIB will again be greater than AMB and ANB. For, of all the lines drawn from centre B to the orbit, BD is the shortest; and the farther away the other lines are, the longer they are. Therefore BM is perceptibly longer than BE. But the perpendicular from B to AM is not perceptibly longer than the one from BE to AE. Therefore the ratio of MB to BA is greater than the ratio of EB to its perpendicular. And so angle BEA is also greater than angle BMA. Therefore if BA is bisected at G, and the perpendicular EGI is drawn, the optical addito-subtraction will be greatest around E and I. But the physical was greatest around D and T. Therefore the composite addito-subtraction is greatest at the mean position between D and E and between T and I.

You have taught us how to compute the mean anomaly and the corrected anomaly from the assumption of anomaly of the eccentric; but practice more frequently requires us, given the mean anomaly, as from the time given, to find the others: teach this too.

Here there is no direct way; but he who wishes to compute this without tables must apply the rule of suppositions, namely by supposing that the anomaly of the eccentric—PK, in the accompanying diagram—is of this or of that magnitude, and upon that assumption, compute the mean anomaly PKA. For if PKA turns out to be as great as it was given to be, then the supposition as to PK, the anomaly of the eccentric, will be right. But if it does not turn out as great, then the supposition is to be corrected in view of the result, and the work done over again.

**Could you by way of example teach a convenient method, lest through unfamiliarity one err too much in mistaken suppositions?**

Then let the foregoing example be used again, and let the said mean anomaly [696] or area PKA be 50°9'10". It is manifest that, if the area of triangle KBA were known, the remaining area KBP would have the same number of degrees as its arc PK; and hence, if the value of KBA is subtracted from PKA, the remainder will be PK, the anomaly of the eccentric. Therefore since PKA is greater than PK; the sine of arc PK will be smaller than the sine of 50°9'10", and therefore smaller than 76.775. In our first supposition, let this sine be 70.000 for the sake of ease in multiplication.

Accordingly if this sine is multiplied by the value of triangle DBA—which was 11,910" in the preceding example—and the last five decimal places are cut off, the product KBA will be 8,337" or 2°18'57". Add these 2°18'57" to the arc of sine 70.000, which is 44°25'. The area PKA will be 46°44'. This is too small, for it is deficient by 3°25', since it ought to be 50°9', the quantity given.

Accordingly, in the second supposition, let a greater sine be supposed, by the addition of the deficiency of 3°25' to the 44°25' of the arc previously supposed, so that PK will be about 47°50'; its sine is approximately 74.000, which I choose for the sake of ease in calculation again. The multiplication of 74.000 by 11,910" makes KBA to be 7'56" greater, namely 2°26'53". Add this to the PK of the second supposition, namely to 47°44'6". Arc PKA will be 50°10'59"; and there will be an excess of 1'49" over the required 50°9'10".

And so we understand that this very small excess is to be subtracted from the third supposition of PK, and the remainder will be the required anomaly of the eccentric, or PK will be equal to 47°42'17". It is possible to prove this. For the sine of this arc is 73.969, and the multiplication of that by 11,910" gives 2°26'50" for KBA. And the addition of that to 47°42'17" gives 50°9'7", which is imperceptibly different from the requisite 50°9'10".

## 5. On the Digression of the Planets Away from the Ecliptic

**What is understood by the name “orbit”?**

Properly speaking, it is that line which the planet describes around the sun by means of the centre of its body. For example, in the diagram, if ECGD is a part of the plane of the ecliptic, HCFD will be the orbit.

But in a secondary sense, it is understood to be the [697] great circle wherein the plane of the orbit continued cuts the sphere of the fixed stars. For example, here it is section MN which has been made by plane CAK continued.

**What do you call the “inclination of the planet” or “of any point in its orbit,” and what is the “circle of inclination”?**

Properly speaking, planets or points do not have inclination, but lines or planes do. But because those planes are circumscribed around the orbits of the planets, and because the lines of movement of the planets are understood as having been described in those planes: in common usage these words have been transferred to the planets themselves, for the sake of brevity in speaking.

Therefore since that which below, in Book VI, will be called latitude, participates in that adventitious or optical irregularity—which is the second thing we will investigate—wherefore, in order that things which are distinct may also be distinguished by their names, let the real digression of the planet from the ecliptic be called not latitude, but inclination. Now it is defined as being the arc of the great circle, in the sphere of the fixed stars, described around the sun, [698] perpendicular to the ecliptic and called the circle of inclination, which arc is intercepted between the ecliptic and the eccentric position of the planet. Or, it is the angle at the sun which this arc measures.

In the diagram, if A is the sun, FKDHC the orbit, and MLO the ecliptic, the inclination of point K will be angle KAI or NAL or its arc NL described around the sun A.

**What do you call “nodes,” and what, “limits”?**

The nodes are the two points on the ecliptic wherein it is cut by the plane of the orbit continued. In Greek, *συνδεσμοί*, because in them different routes, the apparent route of the sun and that of the planet, are knotted together. The one is “The ascending node,” where the planet leaves the southern hemisphere and turns northward; the other “The descending node,” which transfers the planet to the south—the words “ascending” and “descending” having been accommodated to our hemisphere, as that in which the first founders of astronomy lived. For example, if the plane of the orbit and the plane of the ecliptic coincide in line CAD, which, on being prolonged into the sphere of the fixed stars, designates the ecliptic section, M and O will designate the nodes.

[699] But the points on the ecliptic which are 90° distant from the nodes are called the limits: the northern limit, wherefrom the planet is distant to the north, and the southern limit, wherefrom it is distant to the south. They are called limits because the planet arriving at those points does not digress farther in any direction but from that place turns around and begins to return to the ecliptic. For example, in the diagram points E and G on the ecliptic are called the limits. But also points H and F on the real orbit and the corresponding points in the sphere of the fixed stars, are called by the same name, and more frequently too.

**What do you call “the argument of the inclination”?**

It is the arc of the planetary orbit in the sphere of the fixed stars intercepted between the ascending node and the eccentric position of the planet and measured eastwards. For example, if O is the ascending node, N the eccentric position of the planet, OMN will be the argument of inclination. Copernicus uses the northern limit instead of the ascending node.

**The greatest inclination of the limit for any given planet is not the same throughout all the ages, is it?**

According to the physical principles employed in Book IV, of itself it is unchangeable. But on account of the dislocation of the ecliptic—concerning which I shall speak in Book VII—it can change *per accidens*.

**How is the inclination of the planet computed?**

No differently from the way in which the declination of a point on the ecliptic was computed in Book III. If the sine of the greatest inclination is multiplied by the sine of the argument of the inclination, and the last five decimal places are cut off from the product, the sine of the inclination will be given. See the method followed on *folio* 245 *et seqq*. If instead of the sines of the arcs you employ their logarithms, the multiplication will be converted to simple addition.

**What is the eccentric position of the planet on the ecliptic?**

That point on the ecliptic wherein it is cut by the circle of inclination drawn through the eccentric position [700] in the simple sense. For example, if the eccentric position—in the simple sense—of the planet is at N, and NL is the circle of inclination, and angles NLM and NLO are right, L will be the eccentric position of the planet on the ecliptic. It is not called the ecliptic position simply, because it also involves the second irregularity, the matter of Book VI; but the word “eccentric” is added in order for us to understand that it is a question of that position which is determined on the ecliptic by the eccentric alone, without the introduction of the great sphere, whereof I shall speak in Book VI.

**What is the eccentric longitude of the planet held to be?**

The arc of the ecliptic measured eastwards from the beginning of the Ram to the circle of inclination of the planet or its eccentric position on the ecliptic. It is called the eccentric longitude, not because it is measured on the eccentric but because the eccentric causes it.

**What is meant by “the reduction to the ecliptic”?**

The small arc which is equal to the difference between the argument of the inclination and the eccentric longitude—that is, the difference between the two arcs, one on the orbit and the other on the ecliptic, beginning at the common node and ending at the circle of inclination. For example, in this case it is the difference between MN and ML.

**How is it computed?**

Not otherwise than on page 255, Book III, the difference between the right ascension and the corresponding arc on the ecliptic is computed. For if the sine of the complement of the greatest inclination is multiplied by the tangent of the argument of the inclination, and the last five decimal places are cut away from the product, the tangent of the argument of the reduction will be given.

Or else: the antilogarithm of the greatest inclination is added to the mesologarithm of the argument, and thus the sum will be the mesologarithm of the argument of the reduction.

A compendious and more useful method, even for the ascension, is as follows. The greatest reduction around 45° from the node, if multiplied by the sine of twice any arc, and the last five decimals cut off, constitutes the required reduction for the arc taken simply.

**[701] How is this reduction to be employed, and in relation to what?**

When the planet is progressing from the nodes to the limits, the reduction is to be subtracted from the argument of the inclination; it is to be added, when the planet is progressing from the limits to the nodes; then the result, if added to the ascending node, constitutes the eccentric longitude of the position of the planet.

**What do you call “the foreshortening”?**

It is the particle of the distance of the planet from the centre of the sun which corresponds to the sagitta of the inclination of the planet in the same ratio in which the total interval corresponds to the total sine.

Let A be the sun, and P and Q the poles of the ecliptic. Let TAX represent the plane of the ecliptic and EAG the plane of the orbit. Let the planet now be at E or G, and with A as centre and intervals AE, AG let the arcs EH and GF be drawn; and from E and G let the perpendiculars ER and GS be dropped upon TX. HR and SF will be the foreshortenings.

**What is the foreshortened distance?**

It is the straight line in the plane of the ecliptic between the centre of the sun and the perpendicular from the centre of the planetary body. In the diagram, if the planet is at E or G, then AR or AS is the foreshortened distance.

**How is the foreshortened distance computed?**

The assumed distance, expressed in the numbers of the measurement proper to each planet, is multiplied by the sine of the complement of the inclination of the assumed distance, and the last five decimal places are removed from the product. Or, the logarithm [702] of the distance is added to the antilogarithm of the proper inclination, and the sum is the logarithm which is the index of the foreshortened distance.

**Where is the distance foreshortened the most?**

Around the limits, and more around the limit which is nearer the aphelion. For example, if V and Y are the limits, and thus Z and W are the poles of the orbit, and V is nearer the aphelion than Y, then HR will be longer than FS and will be the longest of all.

## 6. On the Movement of the Apsides and Nodes

**How do you define the movement of the apsis among the primary planets?**

It is the arc of the orbit in the sphere of the fixed stars intercepted between that point on the orbit which is at the same distance from the moving node as a fixed point on the ecliptic—viz., the beginning of the Ram, or even the first star of the Ram—and the position of the highest apsis, and measured eastwards.

**What kind of movement is this movement of the apsides?**

It is set down as being uniform, (1) on account of its unbelievable slowness whereby astronomers are impeded to such an extent that they cannot precisely investigate this movement in its single parts; (2) because we have an instance of regularity in one planet, where the period of the apsis of this physical movement, which we touched upon in Book IV, page 945, as resting upon mere conjectures, cannot be prejudicial to this regularity at all, although in virtue of them it seems that this movement can be made irregular. But more about this in Book VI, in connection with the single planets.

**What is to be understood by the movement of the nodes in the primary planets, or what is the longitude of the node?**

The movement of the node is the arc on the ecliptic measured westwards [703] from a fixed point on it—namely, either from the beginning of the Ram or from the position of the first star of the Ram—to the position of the ascending node. But if the measurement is made eastwards, then this arc too can be called the longitude of the node.

**What kind of movement is this movement of the nodes?**

Although it is reasonable that even the movement of this point is uniform of itself, nevertheless it seems that some irregularity is present in it *per accidens*, on account of the dislocation of the ecliptic, with which Book VII is concerned.

**What figures do the movement of the nodes and limits describe?**

The nodes proceed along the great circle of the ecliptic, while the limits of the orbit, in so far as their inclination is assumed to remain unchangeable, proceed in circles parallel to the ecliptic or to that circle with reference to which their inclination is unchangeable.

In order to aid the understanding, their movements can be represented by a not absurd picture [of the movements] of the poles, provided we remember that, physically speaking, there is no need of the poles. For example, in the accompanying diagram, let the orbit be VY—by the continuation of the plane to the sphere of the fixed stars—and let its poles Z and W move in small circles around P and Q, the poles of the ecliptic TX. Therefore in what direction away from P pole Z moves at any time, the limit V moves in this same direction away from point T on the ecliptic, and so does the limit Y away from point X on the ecliptic; and the circuit of Z in the small circle, which is parallel to TX in the same direction, is followed by the limit V in a northern parallel which is as much greater [than the small circle] as it is nearer to TX, and similarly Y, in the southern parallel. For the following six points will always be found in the great circle of inclination: Z and W the poles of the orbit, P and Q the poles of the ecliptic, and V and Y the limits of the orbit.

Accordingly, up to now we have been concerned with the definitions of the terms having to do with the planetary orbit and the eccentric circle circumscribed around it. Since they are common to all the five planets, they have been put ahead in Book V. However, we shall teach their employment, with respect to the single planets, in Book VI, which follows.
