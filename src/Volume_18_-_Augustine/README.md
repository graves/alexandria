# Volume 18 - Augustine

## AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO (354-430 A.D.)

Saint Augustine was the most influential theologian in Western Christianity. A convert from Manichaeism through Neoplatonism to Christianity, his works shaped Christian doctrine, philosophy, and spirituality for centuries.

### Works in This Volume

- **The Confessions** - Augustine's spiritual autobiography, tracing his journey from youthful dissipation through philosophical searching to Christian conversion. A profound meditation on memory, time, sin, and grace, it is one of the first great works of introspective literature.

- **The City of God** - A monumental work of Christian philosophy and apologetics, written in response to the sack of Rome in 410 A.D. Augustine contrasts the "City of God" (the community of the faithful) with the "City of Man" (earthly society), offering a comprehensive Christian philosophy of history and politics.

- **On Christian Doctrine** - A treatise on biblical interpretation and the use of classical learning in Christian education, establishing principles of hermeneutics and rhetoric for Christian preaching and teaching.
