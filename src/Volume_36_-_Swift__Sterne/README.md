# Volume 36 - Swift, Sterne

## JONATHAN SWIFT (1667-1745)

Jonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, and clergyman, Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. The foremost prose satirist in the English language, Swift used irony and parody to expose human folly and political corruption.

### Works in This Volume

- **Gulliver's Travels** - Swift's masterpiece of satirical fiction, recounting the voyages of Lemuel Gulliver to Lilliput (where he is a giant among tiny people), Brobdingnag (where he is tiny among giants), Laputa (a flying island of impractical philosophers), and the land of the Houyhnhnms (rational horses who rule over brutish Yahoos). A devastating critique of human nature, politics, and the pretensions of reason.

## LAURENCE STERNE (1713-1768)

Sterne was an Irish-born English novelist and clergyman, author of one of the most innovative novels in the English language. His experimental narrative techniques, digressions, and typographical games anticipated modern and postmodern fiction.

### Works in This Volume

- **Tristram Shandy** - *The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman*, a comic novel that playfully subverts every convention of narrative. Ostensibly an autobiography, it takes hundreds of pages before the hero is even born, as Sterne digresses endlessly on his family, philosophy, and the nature of storytelling itself.
