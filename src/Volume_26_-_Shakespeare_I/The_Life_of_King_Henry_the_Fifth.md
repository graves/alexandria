## Prologue

*Enter Chorus.*

Chor. O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire
Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object: can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Into a thousand parts divide one man,
And make imaginary puissance:
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Admit me Chorus to this history;
Who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

*Exit.*

## Act I

### Scene I. London: An Antechamber in the King's Palace

*Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of Ely.*

Cant. My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.

Ely. But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

Cant. It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the Church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the King's honour,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the King beside,
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.

Ely. This would drink deep.

Cant. 'Twould drink the cup and all.

Ely. But what prevention?

Cant. The King is full of grace and fair regard.

Ely. And a true lover of the holy Church.

Cant. The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelope and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood
With such a heady current, scouring faults;
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this King.

Ely. We are blessed in the change.

Cant. Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the King were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude, and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.

Ely. The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the Prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

Cant. It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.

Ely. But, my good lord,
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons? Doth his Majesty
Incline to it, or no?

Cant. He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exhibitors against us;
For I have made an offer to his Majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his Grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.

Ely. How did this offer seem received, my lord?

Cant. With good acceptance of his Majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

Ely. What was the impediment that broke this off?

Cant. The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

Ely. It is.

Cant. Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

Ely. I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene II. The Same: The Presence Chamber

*Enter King Henry, Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Warwick, Westmoreland, and Attendants.*

K. Hen. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

Exe. Not here in presence.

K. Hen. Send for him, good uncle.

West. Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?

K. Hen. Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

*Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of Ely.*

Cant. God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!

K. Hen. Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
'Gainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note, and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.

Cant. Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives, and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your Highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
*In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:*
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land":
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloss
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear the Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France;
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, who deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, who was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son
To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Louis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengarde,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Louis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your Highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

K. Hen. May I with right and conscience make this claim?

Cant. The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
"When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord,
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit.
And your great-uncle's Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English, that could entertain
With half their forces the full pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!

Ely. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

Exe. Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.

West. They know your Grace hath cause and means and might;
So hath your Highness; never King of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.

Cant. O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.

K. Hen. We must not only arm to invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
With all advantages.

Cant. They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

K. Hen. We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
With ample and brimfulness of his force,
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
That England, being empty of defence,
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.

Cant. She hath been then more feared than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.

West. But there's a saying very old and true,
"If that you will France win,
Then with Scotland first begin":
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.

Exe. It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity.
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high and low and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.

Cant. Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.

K. Hen. Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.

*Exeunt some Attendants.*

Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
Ruling in large and ample empery
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.

*Enter Ambassadors of France.*

Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him, not from the King.

1st Amb. May't please your Majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

K. Hen. We are no tyrant, but a Christian king:
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

1st Amb. Thus, then, in few.
Your Highness, lately sending into France,
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
In answer of which claim, the Prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth,
And bids you be advised there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.

K. Hen. What treasure, uncle?

Exe. Tennis-balls, my liege.

K. Hen. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chases. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days.
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous license; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days.
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.

*Exeunt Ambassadors.*

Exe. This was a merry message.

K. Hen. We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lord, omit no happy hour
That may give furtherance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France,
Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought,
That this fair action may on foot be brought.

*Exeunt. Flourish.*

## Act II

### Prologue

*Flourish. Enter Chorus.*

Chor. Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits Expectation in the air,
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial, crowns, and coronets,
Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England! model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Have, for the gilt of France—O guilt indeed!—
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton,
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
The abuse of distance; force a play:
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
The King is set from London; and the scene
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
But, till the King come forth, and not till then,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

*Exit.*

### Scene I. London: A Street

*Enter Nym and Lieutenant Bardolph.*

Bard. Well met, Corporal Nym.

Nym. Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.

Bard. What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little; but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but what though? it will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man's sword will: and there's an end.

Bard. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it be so, good Corporal Nym.

Nym. Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the rendezvous of it.

Bard. It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you were troth-plight to her.

Nym. I cannot tell; things must be as they may: men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time; and some say knives have edges. It must be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I cannot tell.

*Enter Pistol and Mistress Quickly, the Hostess.*

Bard. Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!

Pist. Base tike, call'st thou me host?
Now, by this hand, I swear, I scorn the term;
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.

Quick. No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentle-

### SCENE I

Mistress Quickly. Women that live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight. [Nym and Pistol draw.] O, welladay! Lady, if he be not drawn now, we shall see willful adultery and murder committed.

Bardolph. Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.

Nym. Pish!

Pistol. Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!

Bardolph. Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.

Nym. Will you shog off? I would have you solus.

Pistol. "Solus," egregious dog? O viper vile!
The "solus" in thy most marv'ling face;
The "solus" in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
I do retort the "solus" in thy bowels;
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
And flashing fire will follow.

Nym. I am not Bardolph; you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk off, I would prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.

Pistol. O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;
Therefore exhale.

Bardolph. Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier. [Draws.]

Pistol. An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.

Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give;
Thy spirits are most tall.

Nym. I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair terms: that is the humour of it.

Pistol. "Couple a gorge!"

That is the word. I thee defy again.
O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
No; to the spitalo,
And from the powdering-tub of infamy
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
For the only she; and—pauca, there's enough.

Go to.

Enter Boy.

Boy. Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed. Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.

Away, you rogue! go.

Mistress Quickly. By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days. The king has killed his heart. Good husband, come home presently.

[Exeunt Mistress Quickly and Boy.

Bardolph. Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France together: why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats?

Pistol. Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!

Nym. You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?

Pistol. Base is the slave that pays.

Nym. That now I will have: that's the humour of it.

Pistol. As manhood shall compound: push home.

They draw.

Bardolph. By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll kill him; by this sword I will.

Pistol. Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.

Bardolph. Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends: an thou wilt not, why, then be enemies with me too. Prithee, put up.

Nym. I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?

Pistol. A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
And liquor likewise will I give to thee.
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:
I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;
Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
Give me thy hand.

Nym. I shall have my noble?

Pistol. In cash most justly paid.

Nym. Well, then, that's the humour of't.

Re-enter Mistress Quickly.

Mistress Quickly. As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold. Sweet men, come to him.

Nym. The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's the even of it.

Pistol. Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
His heart is fractured and corroborate.

Nym. The king is a good king; but it must be as it may; he passes some humours and careers.

Pistol. Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we will live.

---

### Scene ii. Southampton: a council-chamber

Enter Exeter, Bedford, and Westmoreland.

Bedford. 'Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.

Exeter. They shall be apprehended by and by.

Westmoreland. How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

Bedford. The king hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.

Exeter. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.

Trumpets sound. Enter King Henry, Scroop, Cambridge, Grey, and Attendants.

King Henry. Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?

Scroop. No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

King Henry. I doubt not that: since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us.

Cambridge. Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
Than is your Majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government.

Grey. True: those that were your father's enemies
Have steep'd their galls in honey, and do serve you
With hearts created of duty and of zeal.

King Henry. We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
And shall forget the office of our hand
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness.

Scroop. So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
And labour shall refresh itself with hope
To do your Grace incessant services.

King Henry. We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
Enlarge the man committed yesterday
That rail'd against our person: we consider
It was excess of wine that set him on;
And on his more advice we pardon him.

Scroop. That's mercy, but too much security:
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

King Henry. O, let us yet be merciful.

Cambridge. So may your Highness, and yet punish too.

Grey. Sir, you show great mercy, if you give him life
After the taste of much correction.

King Henry. Alas, your too much love and care of me
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man.
Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person,
Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:
Who are the late commissioners?

Cambridge. I, one, my lord:
Your Highness bade me ask for it to-day.

Scroop. So did you me, my liege.

Grey. And I, my royal sovereign.

King Henry. Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
There yours. Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
Read them; and know I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
We will aboard to-night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
That hath so cowarded and chas'd your blood
Out of appearance?

Cambridge. I do confess my fault,
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.

Grey. Which we all appeal.

Scroop. [Aside]...

King Henry. The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers,
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here:
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honour; and this man
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
And sworn unto the practises of France,
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
That almost might'st have coin'd me into gold,
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use!
May it be possible that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural cause
That admiration did not hoop at them:
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder;
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd
From glistering semblances of piety;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
If that the same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back
And tell the legions, "I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishman's."

O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
Why, so didst thou; or are they spare in diet,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the ear,
And but in purged judgement trusting neither?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practises!

Exeter. I arrest thee of high treason, by the name
Of Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name
Of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name
Of Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

Scroop. Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
And I repent my fault more than my death,
Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
Although my body pay the price of it.

Cambridge. For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended:
But God be thanked for prevention,
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.

Grey. Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
Prevented from a damned enterprise:
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

King Henry. God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspir'd against our royal person,
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his coffers
Received the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
His princes and his peers to servitude,
His subjects to oppression and contempt,
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
You patience to endure, and true repentance
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.

[Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, guarded.

Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you, as us, most glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God,
Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
No king of England, if not king of France.

[Exeunt.

### Scene iii. London: before a tavern

Enter Pistol, Mistress Quickly, Nym, Bardolph, and Boy.

Mistress Quickly. Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.

Pistol. No; for my manly heart doth yearn. Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:
Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead.
And we must yearn therefore.

Bardolph. Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell!

Mistress Quickly. Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. He made a finer end and went away as if he had been any christom child; he parted even just between twelve and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and he babbled of green fields. "How now, Sir John!" quoth I: "what, man! be of good cheer." So he cried out "God, God, God!" three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bad him he should not think of God; I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bad me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold as any stone.

Nym. They say he cried out of sack.

Bardolph. Ay, that he did.

Bardolph. And of women.

Mistress Quickly. Nay, that he did not.

Boy. Yes, that he did; and said they were devils incarnate.

Mistress Quickly. He could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.

Boy. He said once the devil would have him about women.

Mistress Quickly. He did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.

Boy. Do you not remember, he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose, and he said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?

Bardolph. Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's all the riches I got in his service.

Nym. Shall we shog? the king will be gone from Southampton.

Pistol. Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables:
Let senses rule; the word is "Pitch and Pay":
Trust none;
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes.
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
Therefore, Cave to be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys.
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

Boy. And that's but unwholesome food, they say.

Pistol. Touch her soft mouth, and march.

Bardolph. Farewell, hostess. [Kissing her.]

Nym. I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.

Pistol. Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.

Mistress Quickly. Farewell; adieu.

[Exeunt.

### Scene iv. France: the King's palace

Flourish. Enter the French King, the Dauphin, the Dukes of Berri and Bretagne, the Constable, and others.

French King. Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth.
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.

Dauphin. My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so lull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations
Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected
As were a war in expectation.

Constable. O peace, Prince Dauphin!
You are too much mistaken in this king:
Question your Grace the late ambassadors,
With what great state he heard their embassy,
How well supplied with noble counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution.
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly.
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.

Dauphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable;
But though we think it so, it is no matter:
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak and niggardly projection
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.

French King. Think we King Harry strong;
And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths:
Witness our too memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
And all our princes captived by the hand
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him
Mangle the work of nature and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him.

Enter a Messenger.

Messenger. Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your Majesty.

French King. We'll give them present audience.
Go, and bring them.

[Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords.

You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.

Dauphin. Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head:
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.

Re-enter Lords, with Exeter and train.

French King. From our brother England?

Exeter. From him; and thus he greets your Majesty:
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, 'long
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
And all wide-stretch'd honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
He sends you this most memorable line
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing you overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger.

French King. Or else what follows?

Exeter. Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove too,
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens' groans
For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threatening, and my message;
Only he adds, "If not," then he intends to try
A bloody course.

French King. For us, we will consider of this further:
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England.

Dauphin. For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him: what to him from England?

Exeter. Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
And anything that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king; and if your father's highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it
That caves and wombs of France shall chide your trespass
And return your mock in second accent of his ordnance.

Dauphin. Say, if my father render fair return.
It is against my will; for I desire
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
As matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls.

Exeter. He'll make your Paris' Louvre shake for it,
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
And, be assur'd, you'll find a difference,
As we his subjects have in wonder found
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
In your own losses, if he stay in France.

French King. To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.

Exeter. Dispatch us with all speed, lest our king
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.

French King. You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions;
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence.

[Flourish. Exeunt.

## ACT III

### PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus.

Chorus. Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phœbus fanning:
Play with your fancies, and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
You stand upon the rivage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance;
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
With one appearing hair, that will not follow
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
Behold the ordnance on their carriages
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back,
Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches.
Alarum, and chambers go off,
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.

[Exit.

---

### Scene i. France: before Harfleur

Alarum. Enter King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Gloucester, and Soldiers, with scaling-ladders.

King Henry. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let it pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry, "God for Harry, England, and Saint George!"

[Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off.

---

### Scene ii. The same

Enter Nym, Bardolph, Pistol, and Boy.

Bardolph. On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!

Nym. Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot; and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives: the humour of it is too hot, that is the very plain-song of it.

Pistol. The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound:

"Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
And sword and shield,
In bloody field,
Doth win immortal fame."

Boy. Would I were in an alehouse in London!

Bard. I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and
safety.

Pist. And I:
> If wishes would prevail with me,
> My purpose should not fail with me.
> But thither would I hie.

Boy.
> As duly, but not as truly,
> As bird doth sing on bough.

Enter Fluellen.

Flu. Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you
cullions!
[Driving them forward.]

Pist. Be merciful, great Duke, to men of mould.
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage.
Abate thy rage, great Duke!
Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet
chuck!

Nym. These be good humours! your honour
wins bad humours.
[Exeunt all but Boy.]

Boy. As young as I am, I have observed these
three swashers. I am boy to them all three: but
all they three, though they would serve me, could
not be man to me; for indeed three such antics
do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is
white-faced and red-faced; by the means whereof
a' faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he
hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the
means whereof a' breaks words, and keeps whole
weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of
few words are the best men; and therefore he
scorns to say his prayers, lest a' should be thought
a coward: but his few bad words are matched
with as few good deeds; for a' never broke any
man’s head but his own, and that was against a
post when he was drunk. They will steal anything,
and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case,
bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three
halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers
in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel:
I knew by that piece of service the men would
carry coals. They would have me as familiar
with men’s pockets as their gloves or
their handkerchers: which makes much against
my manhood, if I should take from another’s
pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing
up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some
better service: their villainy goes against my weak
stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.
[Exit.]

Re-enter Fluellen, Gower following.

Gow. Captain Fluellen, you must come presently
to the mines; the Duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

Flu. To the mines! tell you the Duke, it is not
so good to come to the mines; for, look you, the
mines are not according to the disciplines of the
war: the concavities of it are not sufficient; for,
look you, th' adversary, you may discuss unto
the Duke, look you, has digged himself four yards
under the countermines: by Cheshu, I think a'
will plow up all, if there is not better directions.

Gow. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the
order of the siege is given, is altogether directed
by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

Flu. It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

Gow. I think it be.

Flu. By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world:
I will verify as much in his beard: he has no
more directions in the true disciplines of the wars,
look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a
puppy-dog.

Enter Macmorris and Captain Jamy.

Gow. Here a' comes; and the Scots captain,
Captain Jamy, with him.

Flu. Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gen-
tleman, that is certain; and of great expedition
and knowledge in th' ancient wars, upon my
particular knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu,
he will maintain his argument as well as any
military man in the world, in the disciplines of
the pristine wars of the Romans.

Jamy. I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.

Flu. God-den to your worship, good Captain
James.

Gow. How now, Captain Macmorris! have you
quit the mines? have the pioneers given o'er?

Mac. By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work is
given over, the trumpet sounds the retreat. By my
hand, I swear, and my father’s soul, the work is
ill done; it is given over: I would have blowed up
the town, so Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O,
tish ill done, tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill
done!

Flu. Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now,
will you vouchsafe me, look you, a few disputa-
tions with you, as partly touching or concerning
the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in
the way of argument, look you, and friendly
communication; partly to satisfy my opinion,
and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my
mind, as touching the direction of the military
discipline; that is the point.

Jamy. It sall be vary good, good faith, good cap-
tains both: and I sall quit you with good leave, as I
may pick occasion; that sall I, marry.

Mac. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save
me: the day is hot, and the weather, and the
wars, and the King, and the Dukes: it is no time
to discourse. The town is beseeched, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach; and we talk, and,
be Chrish, do nothing: ’tis shame for us all: so
God sa' me, ’tis shame to stand still; it is shame,
by my hand: and there are throats to be cut, and
works to be done; and there is nothing done, so
Chrish sa' me, la!

Jamy. By the mess, ere these eyes of mine take
themselves to slumber, I'll do good service, or
I'll lie i' the ground for it; ay, or go to death;
and I'll pay 't as valorously as I may, that sall
I surely do, that is the brief and the long. Marry,
I would full fain hear some question 'tween you
twa.

Flu. Captain Macmorris, I think, look you,
under your correction, there is not many of your
nation—

Mac. Of my nation! What ish my nation? Is a
villain, and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal—
What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?

Flu. Look you, if you take the matter other-
wise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, perad-
venture I shall think you do not use me with that
affability as in discretion you ought to use me,
look you; being as good a man as yourself, both
in the disciplines of war, and in the derivation of
my birth, and in other particularities.

Mac. I do not know you so good a man as myself:
so Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.

Gow. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each
other.

Jamy. Ay, that’s a foul fault.

A parley sounded.

Gow. The town sounds a parley.

Flu. Captain Macmorris, when there is better
opportunity to be required, look you, I
will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines
of war; and there is an end.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene III. The same: before the gates

The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the
English forces below. Enter King Henry and his
train.

K. Hen. How yet resolves the governor of the
town?
This is the latest parle we will admit:
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up.
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering
infants.
What is it then to me, if impious war,
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
What is't to me, when you yourselves are
cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people.
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of
grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.
If not, why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking
daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the
walls.
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls con-
fused
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? will you yield and this avoid,
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

Gov. Our expectation hath this day an end:
The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,
Returns us that his powers are not yet ready
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great
King,
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
For we no longer are defensible.

K. Hen. Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain.
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest;
To-morrow for the march are we addressed.
[Flourish. The King and his train enter
the town.]

### Scene IV. The French King's Palace

Enter Katharine and Alice.

Kath. *Alice, tu as été en Angleterre, et tu parles
bien le langage.*

Alice. *Un peu, madame.*

Kath. *Je te prie, m'enseignez; il faut que j'apprenne
à parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglais?*

Alice. *La main? elle est appelée de hand.*

Kath. *De hand. Et les doigts?*

Alice. *Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais
je me souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont
appelés de fingres; oui, de fingres.*

Kath. *La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres.
Je pense que je suis le bon écolier; j'ai gagné deux
mots d'Anglais vraiment. Comment appelez-vous les
ongles?*

Alice. *Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.*

Kath. *De nails. Écoutez; dites-moi, si je parle
bien: de hand, de fingres, et de nails.*

Alice. *C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon
Anglais.*

Kath. *Dites-moi l'Anglais pour le bras.*

Alice. *De arm, madame.*

Kath. *Et le coude?*

Alice. *De elbow.*

Kath. *De elbow. Je m'en fais la répétition de tous
les mots que vous m'avez appris d'ici à présent.*

Alice. *Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.*

Kath. *Excusez-moi, Alice; écoutez: de hand, de
fingres, de nails, de arm, de elbow.*

Alice. *De elbow, madame.*

Kath. *Ô Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! de elbow.
Comment appelez-vous le col?*

Alice. *De nick, madame.*

Kath. *De nick. Et le menton?*

Alice. *De chin.*

Kath. *De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin.*

Alice. *Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en vérité, vous
prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.*

Kath. *Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grâce de
Dieu, et en peu de temps.*

Alice. *N'avez-vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai
enseigné?*

Kath. *Non, je réciterai à vous promptement: de
hand, de fingres, de nails—*

Alice. *De nails, madame.*

Kath. *De nails, de arm, de elbow.*

Alice. *Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.*

Kath. *Ainsi dis-je; de elbow, de nick, et de sin.
Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?*

Alice. *De foot, madame; et de coun.*

Kath. *De foot et de coun! Ô Seigneur Dieu! ce sont
mots si mauvais, corruptibles, gros, et impudiques,
et non pour les dames d'honneur à user: je ne voudrais
prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France
pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le coun!
Néanmoins, je réciterai une autre fois ma leçon en-
semble: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arm, de
elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.*

Alice. *Excellent, madame!*

Kath. *C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous à dîner.*
[Exeunt.]

### Scene V. The same

Enter the King of France, the Dauphin, the Duke
of Bourbon, the Constable of France, and
others.

Fr. King. 'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river
Somme.

Con. And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
Let us not live in France; let us quit all
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

Dau. *Ô Dieu vivant!* shall a few sprays of us,
The emptying of our father’s luxury,
Our scions put in wild and savage stock,
Spirit up so suddenly into the clouds
And overlook their grafters?

Con. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman
bastards!
*Mort de ma vie!* if they march along
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

Con. *Dieu de batailles!* where have they this
mettle?
Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull,
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden
water,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses’ thatch, whiles a more frosty
people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Poor we may call them in their native lords.

Dau. By faith and honour,
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

Bour. They bid us to the English dancing-
schools,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;
Saying our grace is only in our heels,
And that we are most lofty runaways.

Fr. King. Where is Montjoy the herald?
speed him hence:
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;
You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berry,
Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
Jaques, Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and
knights,
For your great seats now quit you of great
shames.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.

Con. This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear
And for achievement offer us his ransom.

Fr. King. Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on
Montjoy,
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

Dau. Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.

Fr. King. Be patient, for you shall remain with
us.
Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all,
And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene VI. The English camp in Picardy

Enter Gower and Fluellen, meeting.

Gow. How now, Captain Fluellen! come you
from the bridge?

Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent serv-
ices committed at the bridge.

Gow. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as
Agamemnon; and a man that I love and honour
with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and
my life, and my living, and my uttermost power:
he is not—God be praised and blessed!—any
hurt in the world; but keeps the bridge most
valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an
aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge, I think
in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as
Mark Antony; and he is a man of no estimation
in the world; but I did see him do as gallant
service.

Gow. What do you call him?

Flu. He is called Aunchient Pistol.

Gow. I know him not.

Enter Pistol.

Flu. Here is the man.

Pist. Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours.
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

Flu. Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some
love at his hands.

Pist. Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of
heart,
And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,
And giddy Fortune’s furious fickle wheel,
That goddess blind,
That stands upon the rolling restless stone—

Flu. By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. For-
tune is painted blind, with a muffler afore her
eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and
she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you,
which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and
her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
Fortune is an excellent moral.

Pist. Fortune is Bardolph’s foe, and frowns on
him;
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must he
be:
A damned death!
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate:
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price.
Therefore, go speak: the Duke will hear thy
voice;
And let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut
With edge of penny-cord and vile reproach:
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee
requite.

Flu. Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand
your meaning.

Pist. Why then, rejoice therefore.

Flu. Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to
rejoice at: for if, look you, he were my brother,
I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure,
and put him to execution; for discipline ought to
be used.

Pist. Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friend-
ship!

Flu. It is well.

Pist. The fig of Spain!
[Exit.]

Flu. Very good.

Gow. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal;
I remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.

Flu. I’ll assure you, a' uttered as prave words at
the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day.
But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that
is well, I warrant you, when time is served.

Gow. Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now
and then goes to the wars, to grace himself at his
return into London under the form of a soldier.
And such fellows are perfect in the great com-
mander’s names; and they will learn you by rote
where services were done; at such and such a
sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who
came off bravely, who was shot, who disgraced,
what terms the enemy stood on; and this they
con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they
trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what a beard
of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp
will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed
wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But you must
learn to know such slanders of the age, or else
you may be marvellously mistaken.

Flu. I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do per-
ceive he is not the man that he would gladly make
show to the world he is: if I find a hole in his
coat, I will tell him my mind.
[Drum heard.]
Hark you, the King is coming, and I must speak
with him from the pridge.

Drum and Colours. Enter King Henry,
Gloucester, and Soldiers.

God pless your Majesty!

K. Hen. How now, Fluellen! comest thou from
the bridge?

Flu. Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of
Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge:
the French are gone off, look you; and there are
gallant and most prave passages; marry, th' ad-
versary had possession of the pridge; but
he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of Exeter
is master of the pridge: I can tell your Majesty,
the Duke is a prave man.

K. Hen. What men have you lost, Fluellen?

Flu. The perdition of th' adversary hath been
very great, reasonably great: marry, for my part,
I think the Duke hath lost never a man, but one
that is like to be executed for robbing a church,
one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man:
his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs,
and flames o' fire: and his lips blow at his nose,
and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and
sometimes red; but his nose is executed, and his
fire’s out.

K. Hen. We would have all such offenders so
cut off: and we give express charge, that in our
marches through the country, there be nothing
compelled from the villages, nothing taken but
paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused
in disdainful language; for when lenity and
cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

Tucket. Enter Montjoy.

Mont. You know me by my habit.

K. Hen. Well then I know thee: what shall I
know of thee?

Mont. My master’s mind.

K. Hen. Unfold it.

Mont.
> Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry
> of England: Though we seemed dead, we did but
> sleep: advantage is a better soldier than rashness.
> Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur,
> but that we thought not good to bruise an injury
> till it were full ripe: now we speak upon our cue,
> and our voice is imperial: England shall repent
> his folly, see his weakness, and admire our suffer-
> ance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom;
> which must proportion the losses we have borne,
> the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have
> digested; which in weight to re-answer, his petti-
> ness would bow under. For our losses, his exche-
> quer is too poor; for the effusion of our blood, the
> muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and
> for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our
> feet, but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To
> this add defiance: and tell him, for conclusion, he
> hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
> is pronounced.” So far my King and master; so
> much my office.

K. Hen. What is thy name? I know thy quality.

Mont. Montjoy.

K. Hen. Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee
back,
And tell thy King I do not seek him now;
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
My numbers lessen'd, and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me,
God,
That I do brag thus! This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
My army but a weak and sickly guard;
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himself and such another neigh-
bour
Stand in our way. There’s for thy labour, Montjoy.
Go, bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour: and so, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle, as we are;
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
So tell your master.

Mont. I shall deliver so. Thanks to your
Highness.
[Exit.]

Glou. I hope they will not come upon us now.

K. Hen. We are in God’s hand, brother, not in
theirs.
March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves,
And on to-morrow bid them march away.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene VII. The French Camp, near Agincourt

Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ram-
bures, Orleans, Dauphin, with Others.

Con. Tut! I have the best armour of the world.
Would it were day!

Orl. You have an excellent armour; but let my
horse have his due.

Con. It is the best horse of Europe.

Orl. Will it never be morning?

Dau. My Lord of Orleans, and my Lord High
Constable, you talk of horse and armour?

Orl. You are as well provided of both as any
prince in the world.

Dau. What a long night is this! I will not change
my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Ha, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
entrails were hairs; *le cheval volant*, the Pegasus,
*chez les narines de feu!* When I bestride him, I
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

Orl. He’s of the colour of the nutmeg.

Dau. And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast
for Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him,
but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
may call beasts.

Con. Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and
excellent horse.

Dau. It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is
like the bidding of a monarch and his coun-
tenance enforces homage.

Orl. No more, cousin.

Dau. Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot,
from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the
lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a
theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into
eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for
them all: ’tis a subject for a sovereign to reason
on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on;
and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to
lay apart their particular functions and wonder at

# KING HENRY V

him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began
thus: “Wonder of nature”—

Orl. I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mis-
tress.

Dau. Then did they imitate that which I com-
posed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.

Orl. Your mistress bears well.

Dau. Me well; which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress.

Con. Nay, for methought yesterday your mis-
tress shrewdly shook your back.

Dau. So perhaps did yours.

Con. Mine was not bridled.

Dau. O then belike she was old and gentle; and
you rode, like a kern of Ireland, your French
hose off, and in your strait strossers.

Con. You have good judgement in horseman-
ship.

Dau. Be warned by me, then: they that ride so
and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had
rather have my horse to my mistress.

Con. I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

Dau. I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears
his own hair.

Con. I could make as true a boast as that, if I
had a sow to my mistress.

Dau. *Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie lavée au bourbier*: thou makest
use of anything.

Con. Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress,
or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.

Ram. My Lord Constable, the armour that I
saw in your tent to-night, are those stars or suns
upon it?

Con. Stars, my lord.

Dau. Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.

Con. And yet my sky shall not want.

Dau. That may be, for you bear a many super-
fluously, and ’twere more honour some were
away.

Con. Even as your horse bears your praises;
who would trot as well, were some of your brags
dismounted.

Dau. Would I were able to load him with his
desert! Will it never be day? I will trot to-
morrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with
English faces.

Con. I will not say so, for fear I should be faced
out of my way: but I would it were morning;
for I would fain be about the ears of the English.

Ram. Who will go to hazard with me for twenty
prisoners?

Con. You must first go yourself to hazard, ere
you have them.

Dau. ’Tis midnight; I’ll go arm myself.
[Exit.

Orl. The Dauphin longs for morning.

Ram. He longs to eat the English.

Con. I think he will eat all he kills.

Orl. By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant
prince.

Con. Swear by her foot, that she may tread out
the oath.

Orl. He is simply the most active gentleman of
France.

Con. Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.

Orl. He never did harm, that I heard of.

Con. Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep
that good name still.

Orl. I know him to be valiant.

Con. I was told that by one that knows him
better than you.

Orl. What’s he?

Con. Marry, he told me so himself; and he said
he cared not who knew it.

Orl. He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in
him.

Con. By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody
saw it but his lackey: ’tis a hooded valour; and
when it appears, it will bate.

Orl. Ill will never said well.

Con. I will cap that proverb with “There is
flattery in friendship.”

Orl. And I will take up that with “Give the
devil his due.”

Con. Well placed: there stands your friend for
the devil: have at the very eye of that proverb
with “A pox of the devil.”

Orl. You are the better at proverbs, by how
much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”

Con. You have shot over.

Orl. ’Tis not the first time you were overshot.

*Enter a messenger.*

Mess. My Lord High Constable, the English lie
within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.

Con. Who hath measured the ground?

Mess. The Lord Grandpre.

Con. A valiant and most expert gentleman.
Would it were day! Alas, poor Harry of Eng-
land! he longs not for the dawning as we do.

Orl. What a wretched and peevish fellow is
this King of England, to mope with his fat-
brained followers so far out of his knowledge!

Con. If the English had any apprehension, they
would run away.

Orl. That they lack; for if their heads had any
intellectual armour, they could never wear such
heavy head-pieces.

Ram. That island of England breeds very valiant
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable
courage.

Orl. Foolish curs, that run winking into the
mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads
crushed like rotten apples! You may as well say,
that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on
the lip of a lion.

Con. Just, just; and the men do sympathize with
the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on,
leaving their wits with their wives: and then give
them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they
will eat like wolves and fight like devils.

Orl. Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of
beef.

Con. Then shall we find to-morrow they have
only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it
time to arm: come, shall we about it?

Orl. It is now two o’clock: but, let me see, by
ten
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
[Exeunt.

## ACT IV

### PROLOGUE

*Enter chorus.*

Chor. Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of
night
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fix’d sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each other’s watch:
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other’s umber’d face;
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation:
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and over-lusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning’s danger, and their gesture sad
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruin’d band
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”
For forth he goes and visits all his host,
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers, friends, and country-
men.
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night,
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where—O for pity!—we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.
[Exit.

### Scene i. The English camp at Agincourt

*Enter King Henry, Bedford, and Gloucester.*

K. Hen. Gloucester, ’tis true that we are in
great danger;
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
There is some soul of goodness in things evil.
Would men observingly distil it out.
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
Besides, they are our outward consciences,
And preachers to us all, admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
And make a moral of the devil himself.

*Enter Erpingham.*

Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.

Erp. Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me
better.
Since I may say, “Now lie I like a king.”

K. Hen. ’Tis good for men to love their present
pains
Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
And when the mind is quicken’d, out of doubt,
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move.
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
Commend me to the princes in our camp;
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
Desire them all to my pavilion.

Glou. We shall, my liege.

Erp. Shall I attend your Grace?

K. Hen. No, my good knight;
Go with my brothers to my lords of England:
I and my bosom must debate a while,
And then I would no other company.

Erp. The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble
Harry!
[Exeunt all but King.

K. Hen. God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak’st
cheerfully.

*Enter Pistol.*

Pist. *Qui va là?*

K. Hen. A friend.

Pist. Discuss unto me; art thou officer?
Or art thou base, common, and popular?

K. Hen. I am a gentleman of a company.

Pist. Trail’st thou the puissant pike?

K. Hen. Even so. What are you?

Pist. As good a gentleman as the Emperor.

K. Hen. Then you are a better than the King.

Pist. The King’s a bawcock, and a heart of
gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?

K. Hen. Harry le Roy.

Pist. Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of
Cornish crew?

K. Hen. No, I am a Welshman.

Pist. Know’st thou Fluellen?

K. Hen. Yes.

Pist. Tell him, I’ll knock his leek about his pate
Upon Saint Davy’s day.

K. Hen. Do not you wear your dagger in your
cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.

Pist. Art thou his friend?

K. Hen. And his kinsman too.

Pist. The figo for thee, then!

K. Hen. I thank you: God be with you!

Pist. My name is Pistol call’d.
[Exit.

K. Hen. It sorts well with your fierceness.

*Enter Fluellen and Gower.*

Gow. Captain Fluellen!

Flu. So! in the name of Jesus Christ, speak
lower. It is the greatest admiration in the uni-
versal world, when the true and ancient pre-
rogatives and laws of the wars is not kept: if you
would take the pains but to examine the wars of
Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you,
that there is no tittle-tattle nor pibble-pabble in
Pompey’s camp; I warrant you, you shall find
the ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it,
and the forms of it, and the sobriety of it, and the
modesty of it, to be otherwise.

Gow. Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all
night.

Flu. If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a
prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we
should also, look you, be an ass and a fool
and a prating coxcomb? in your own conscience,
now?

Gow. I will speak lower.

Flu. I pray you and beseech you that you will.
[Exeunt Gower and Fluellen.

K. Hen. Though it appear a little out of fashion,
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.

*Enter three soldiers, John Bates, Alexander
Court, and Michael Williams.*

Court. Brother John Bates, is not that the morn-
ing which breaks yonder?

Bates. I think it be: but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

Will. We see yonder the beginning of the day,
but I think we shall never see the end of it. Who
goes there?

K. Hen. A friend.

Will. Under what captain serve you?

K. Hen. Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

Will. A good old commander and a most kind
gentleman: I pray you, what thinks he of our
estate?

K. Hen. Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that
look to be washed off the next tide.

Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?

K. Hen. No; nor it is not meet he should. For,
though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a
man, as I am: the violet smells to him as it doth
to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me;
all his senses have but human conditions: his
ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears
but a man; and though his affections are higher
mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they
stoop with the like wing. Therefore when he sees
reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are: yet, in reason,
no man should possess him with any appearance
of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten
his army.

Bates. He may show what outward courage he
will; but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could
wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I
would he were, and I by him, at all adventures,
so we were quit here.

K. Hen. By my troth, I will speak my con-
science of the King: I think he would not wish
himself any where but where he is.

Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so
should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many
poor men’s lives saved.

K. Hen. I dare say you love him not so ill, to
wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to
feel other men’s minds: methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented as in the King’s com-
pany; his cause being just and his quarrel hon-
ourable.

Will. That’s more than we know.

Bates. Ay, or more than we should seek after;
for we know enough, if we know we are the
King’s subjects: if his cause be wrong, our obe-
dience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.

Will. But if the cause be not good, the King
himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when
all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in
a battle, shall join together at the latter day and
cry all, “We died at such a place”; some swear-
ing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their
wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts
they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I
am afeard there are few die well that die in a
battle; for how can they charitably dispose of
anything, when blood is their argument? Now, if
these men do not die well, it will be a black
matter for the King that led them to it; whom to
disobey were against all proportion of subjection.

K. Hen. So, if a son that is by his father sent
about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the
sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your
rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent
him: or if a servant, under his master’s command
transporting a sum of money, be assailed by
robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities,
you may call the business of the master the
author of the servant’s damnation: but this is not
so: the King is not bound to answer the particular
endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor
the master of his servant; for they purpose not
their death, when they purpose their services.
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so
spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords,
can try it out with all unspotted soldiers: some
peradventure have on them the guilt of premedit-
ated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling
virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some,
making the wars their bulwark, that have before
gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and
robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the
law and outrun native punishment, though they
can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from
God: war is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so
that here men are punished for before-breach of
the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel: where
they feared the death, they have borne life away;
and where they would be safe, they perish: then
if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty
of their damnation than he was before guilty of
those impieties for the which they are now visited.
Every subject’s duty is the King’s; but every
subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every
soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his
bed, wash every mote out of his conscience: and
dying so, death is to him advantage; or not
dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such
preparation was gained: and in him that escapes,
it were not sin to think that, making God so free
an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His
greatness and to teach others how they should
prepare.

Will. ’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the
ill upon his own head, the King is not to answer
it.

Bates. I do not desire he should answer for me;
and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

K. Hen. I myself heard the King say he would
not be ransomed.

Will. Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheer-
fully: but when our throats are cut, he may be
ransomed, and we ne’er the wiser.

K. Hen. If I live to see it, I will never trust his
word after.

Will. You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot
out of an elder-gun, that a poor and a private dis-
pleasure can do against a monarch! you may as
well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning
in his face with a peacock’s feather. You’ll never
trust his word after! come, ’tis a foolish saying.

K. Hen. Your reproof is something too round: I
should be angry with you, if the time were con-
venient.

Will. Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.

K. Hen. I embrace it.

Will. How shall I know thee again?

K. Hen. Give me any gage of thine, and I will
wear it in my bonnet: then, if ever thou darest
acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.

Will. Here’s my glove: give me another of thine.

K. Hen. There.

Will. This will I also wear in my cap: if ever
thou come to me and say, after to-morrow, “This
is my glove,” by this hand, I will take thee a box
on the ear.

K. Hen. If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

Will. Thou darest as well be hanged.

K. Hen. Well, I will do it, though I take thee in
the King’s company.

Will. Keep thy word: fare thee well.

Bates. Be friends, you English fools, be friends:
we have French quarrels enow, if you could tell
how to reckon.

K. Hen. Indeed, the French may lay twenty
French crowns to one, they will beat us; for they
bear them on their shoulders: but it is no English
treason to cut French crowns, and to-morrow the
King himself will be a clipper.
[Exeunt Soldiers.

Upon the King! let us our lives, our souls,
Our debts, our careful wives,
Our children, and our sins lay on the King!
We must bear all. O hard condition,
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
But his own wringing! What infinite heart’s-ease
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idol Ceremony?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
O Ceremony, show me but thy worth!
What is thy soul of adoration?
Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form,
Creating awe and fear in other men?
Wherein thou art less happy being fear’d
Than they in fearing.
What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
But poison’d flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
And bid thy Ceremony give thee cure!
Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s
knee,
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose;
I am a king that find thee, and I know
’Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running ’fore the King,
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world.
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who with a body fill’d and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, cramm’d with distressful
bread;
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
And follows so the ever-running year,
With profitable labour, to his grave:
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
The slave, a member of the country’s peace,
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
What watch the King keeps to maintain the
peace,
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

*Re-enter Erpingham.*

Erp. My lord, your nobles, jealous of your
absence,
Seek through your camp to find you.

K. Hen. Good old knight.
Collect them all together at my tent:
I’ll be before thee.

Erp. I shall do’t, my lord.
[Exit.

K. Hen. O God of battles! steel my soldiers’
hearts;
Possess them not with fear; take from them
now
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O
Lord,
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
My father made in compassing the crown!
I Richard’s body have interred new;
And on it have bestow’d more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood;
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
Who twice a-day their wither’d hands hold up
Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have
built
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard’s soul. More will I do;
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after all,
Imploring pardon.

*Re-enter Gloucester.*

Glou. My liege!

K. Hen. My brother Gloucester’s voice? Ay;
I know thy errand, I will go with thee:
The day, my friends, and all things stay for me.
[Exeunt.

### Scene ii. The French camp

*Enter the Dauphin, Orleans, Rambures,
and others.*

Orl. The sun doth gild our armour; up, my
lords!

Dau. *Montez à cheval!* My horse! varlet! *laquais!* ha!

Orl. O brave spirit!

Dau. *Via! les eaux et la terre!*

Orl. *Rien puis? L'air et le feu!*

Dau. *Ciel*, cousin Orleans!

*Enter Constable.*

Now, my Lord Constable!

Con. Hark, how our steeds for present service
neigh!

Dau. Mount them, and make incision in their
hides,
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

Ram. What, will you have them weep our
horses’ blood?
How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?

*Enter a messenger.*

Mess. The English are embattled, you French
peers.

Con. To horse, you gallant princes! straight to
horse!
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
And your fair show shall suck away their souls.
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands;
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
To give each naked curtal-axe a stain,
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on
them,
The vapour of our valour will o’erturn them.
’Tis positive ’gainst all exceptions, lords,
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
Who in unnecessary action swarm
About our squares of battle, were enow
To purge this field of such a hilding foe.
Though we upon this mountain’s basis by
Took stand for idle speculation:
But that our honours must not. What’s to say?
A very little little let us do,
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
For our approach shall so much dare the field
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

*Enter Grandpre.*

Grand. Why do you stay so long, my lords of
France?
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
Ill-favouredly become the morning field:
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar’d host
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,
With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor
jades
Lob down their heads, dropping their hides and hips,
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chew’d grass, still and motionless;
And their executors, the knavish crows,
Fly o’er them, all impatient for their hour.
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.

Con. They have said their prayers, and they
stay for death.

Dau. Shall we go send them dinners and fresh
suits
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?

Con. I stay but for my guidon: to the field!
I will the banner from a trumpet take,
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
[Exeunt.

### Scene iii. The English camp

*Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham,
Salisbury and Westmoreland.*

Glou. Where is the King?

Bed. The King himself is rode to view their
battle.

West. Of fighting men they have full three
score thousand.

Exe. There’s five to one; besides, they all are
fresh.

Sal. God’s arm strike with us! ’tis a fearful odds.
God be wi’ you, princes all; I’ll to my charge:
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord
Exeter,
And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!

Bed. Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck
go with thee!

Exe. Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day;
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it.
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.
[Exit Salisbury.

Bed. He is as full of valour as of kindness;
Princely in both.

*Enter the King.*

West. O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!

K. Hen. What’s he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark’d to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God’s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God’s peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more, methinks, would share from
me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one
more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my
host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man’s company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is call’d the feast of Crispian:

He that outlives this day and comes safe home
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say, “To-morrow is Saint Crispian”:
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
And say, “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.”
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
But he’ll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names,
Familiar in his mouth as household words,
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember’d.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remembered;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile.
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.

Re-enter Salisbury.

Sal. My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:
The French are bravely in their battles set,
And will with all expedience charge on us.

K. Hen. All things are ready, if our minds be so.
West. Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
K. Hen. Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
West. God’s will! my liege, would you and I alone,
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
K. Hen. Why, now thou hast unwish’d five thousand men;
Which likes me better than to wish us one.
You know your places: God be with you all!

Tucket. Enter Montjoy.

Mont. Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
Before thy most assured overthrow:
For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
Thou needs must be engluttcd. Besides, in mercy,
The Constable desires thee thou wilt mind
Thy followers of repentance; that their souls
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
Must lie and fester.

K. Hen. Who hath sent thee now?
Mont. The Constable of France.
K. Hen. I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion’s skin
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime.
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Mark then abounding valour in our English,
That being dead, like to the bullet’s grazing,
Break out into a second course of mischief,
Killing in relapse of mortality.
Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch’d
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There’s not a piece of feather in our host—
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly—
And time hath worn us into slovenry;
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
They’ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
The gay new coats o’er the French soldiers’ heads
And turn them out of service. If they do this—
As, if God please, they shall—my ransom then
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald;
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
Which if they have as I will leave ’em them,
Shall yield them little, tell the Constable.

Mont. I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
Thou never shalt hear herald any more. [Exit.

K. Hen. I fear thou’lt once more come again for ransom.

Enter York.

York. My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
The leading of the vaward.

K. Hen. Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day! [Exeunt.

### Scene iv. The field of battle

Alarum. Excursions. Enter Pistol, French Soldier, and Boy.

Pist. Yield, cur!
Fr. Sol. *Je pense que vous êtes gentilhomme de bonne qualité.*
Pist. *Qualtitie calmie custure me!* Art thou a gentleman? what is thy name? discuss.
Fr. Sol. *O Seigneur Dieu!*
Pist. O, *Signieur Dew* should be a gentleman:
Perpend my words, O *Signieur Dew*, and mark;
O *Signieur Dew*, thou diest on point of fox.
Except, O *signieur*, thou do give to me
Egregious ransom.
Fr. Sol. *O, prenez miséricorde! ayez pitié de moi!*
Pist. *Moy* shall not serve; I will have forty *moys*;
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
In drops of crimson blood.
Fr. Sol. *Est-il impossible d'échapper la force de ton bras?*
Pist. Brass, cur!
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
Offer’st me brass?
Fr. Sol. *O pardonnez-moi!*
Pist. Say’st thou me so? is that a ton of *moys*?
Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
What is his name.
Boy. *Écoutez: comment êtes-vous appelé?*
Fr. Sol. *Monsieur le Fer.*
Boy. He says his name is Master Fer.
Pist. Master Fer! I’ll fer him, and firk him, and ferret him: discuss the same in French unto him.
Boy. I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.
Pist. Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.
Fr. Sol. *Que dit-il, monsieur?*
Boy. *Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous prêt; car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure de couper votre gorge.*
Pist. *Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy.*
Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
Fr. Sol. *O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison: gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents écus.*
Pist. What are his words?
Boy. He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of a good house; and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns.
Pist. Tell him my fury shall abate, and I
The crowns will take.
Fr. Sol. *Petit monsieur, que dit-il?*
Boy. *Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner aucun prisonnier, néanmoins, pour les écus que vous l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la liberté, le franchissement.*
Fr. Sol. *Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercîments: et je m'estime heureux que je suis tombé entre les mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave, vaillant, et très distingué seigneur d'Angleterre.*
Pist. Expound unto me, boy.
Boy. He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave, valorous, and thrice-worthy *seigneur* of England.
Pist. As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
Follow me!
Boy. *Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.* [Exeunt Pistol, and French Soldier.] I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart: but the saying is true, “The empty vessel makes the greatest sound.” Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i’ the old play, that every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger: and they are both hanged; and so would this be, if he durst steal anything adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with the luggage of our camp: the French might have a good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is none to guard it but boys. [Exit.

### Scene v. Another part of the field

Enter Constable, Orleans, Bourbon, Dauphin, and Rambures.

Con. *O diable!*
Orl. *O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!*
Dau. *Mort de ma vie!* all is confounded, all!
Reproach and everlasting shame
Sits mocking in our plumes. *O méchante fortune!*
Do not run away.

A short alarum.

Con. Why, all our ranks are broke.
Dau. O perdurable shame! let’s stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we play’d at dice for?
Orl. Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
Bour. Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
Let us die in honour: once more back again;
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand,
Like a base pandar, hold the chamber-door
Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
His fairest daughter is contaminated.
Con. Disorder, that hath spoil’d us, friend us now!
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
Orl. We are enow yet living in the field
To smother up the English in our throngs,
If any order might be thought upon.
Bour. The devil take order now! I’ll to the throng:
Let life be short; else shame will be too long. [Exeunt.

### Scene vi. Another part of the field

Alarums. Enter King Henry and forces, Exeter, and others.

K. Hen. Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
But all’s not done; yet keep the French the field.
Exe. The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty.
K. Hen. Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
I saw him down; thrice up again, and fighting;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
Exe. In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep’d,
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
That bloodily did yawn upon his face;
And cries aloud, “Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry!”
Upon these words I came and cheer’d him up:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And, with a feeble gripe, says, “Dear my lord,
Commend my service to my sovereign.”
So did he turn and over Suffolk’s neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss’d his lips;
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal’d
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp’d;
But I had not so much of man in me,
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.
K. Hen. I blame you not;
For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.

Alarum.

But, hark! what new alarum is this same?
The French have reinforced their scatter’d men:
Then every soldier kill his prisoners;
Give the word through. [Exeunt.

### Scene vii. Another part of the field

Enter Fluellen and Gower.

Flu. Kill the boys and the luggage! ’tis expressly against the law of arms: ’tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offer’d; in your conscience, now, is it not?
Gower. ’Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive; and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha’ done this slaughter: besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the King’s tent; wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat. O, ’tis a gallant king!
Flu. Ay, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What call you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig was born?
Gower. Alexander the Great.
Flu. Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations.
Gower. I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon: his father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
Flu. I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is born. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the world, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is out of my brains what is the name of the other river; but ’tis all one, ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmon in both. If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well; for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicated in his brains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
Gower. Our King is not like him in that: he never killed any of his friends.
Flu. It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it: as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits and his good judgements, turned away the fat knight with the great-belly doublet: he was full of jests, and gibes, and knaveries, and mocks; I have forgot his name.
Gower. Sir John Falstaff.
Flu. That is he: I’ll tell you there is good men born at Monmouth.
Gower. Here comes his Majesty.

Alarum. Enter King Henry, and forces; Warwick, Gloucester, Exeter, and others.

K. Hen. I was not angry since I came to France
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
Or void the field; they do offend our sight:
If they’ll do neither, we will come to them
And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have,
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

Enter Montjoy.

Exe. Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
Glo. His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
K. Hen. How now! what means this, herald? know’st thou not
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Comest thou again for ransom?
Mont. No, great King:
I come to thee for charitable license,
That we may wander o’er this bloody field
To look our dead, and then to bury them;
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes—woe the while!—
Lie drown’d and soak’d in mercenary blood;
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great King,
To view the field in safety and dispose
Of their dead bodies!
K. Hen. I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no;
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop o’er the field.
Mont. The day is yours.
K. Hen. Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
What is this castle call’d that stands hard by?
Mont. They call it Agincourt.
K. Hen. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
Flu. Your Grandfather of famous memory, an’t please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Black Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles, fought a most brave battle here in France.
K. Hen. They did, Fluellen.
Flu. Your Majesty says very true: if your Majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps; which, your Majesty know, to this hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Davy’s day.
K. Hen. I wear it for a memorable honour;
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
Flu. All the water in Wye cannot wash your Majesty’s Welsh blood out of your body, I can tell you that: God bless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases His Grace, and His Majesty too!
K. Hen. Thanks, good my countryman.
Flu. By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman, I care not who know it; I will confess it to all the world: I need not be ashamed of your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
K. Hen. God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither,
[Points to Williams. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy.]
Exe. Soldier, you must come to the King.
K. Hen. Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?
Will. An’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.
K. Hen. An Englishman?
Will. An’t please your Majesty, a rascal that swaggered with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box o’ th’ ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.
K. Hen. What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this soldier keep his oath?
Flu. He is a craven and a villain else, an’t please your Majesty, in my conscience.
K. Hen. It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.
Flu. Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a jacksauce, as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and his earth, in my conscience, la!
K. Hen. Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.
Will. So I will, my liege, as I live.
K. Hen. Who servest thou under?
Will. Under Captain Gower, my liege.
Flu. Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars.
K. Hen. Call him hither to me, soldier.
Will. I will, my liege. [Exit.
K. Hen. Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and stick it in thy cap: when *Alençon* and myself were down together, I plucked this glove from his helm: if any man challenge this, he is a friend to *Alençon*, and an enemy to our person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
Flu. Your Grace doth me as great honours as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find himself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but I would fain see it once, an please God of His grace that I might see.
K. Hen. Knowest thou Gower?
Flu. He is my dear friend, an please you.
K. Hen. Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
Flu. I will fetch him. [Exit.
K. Hen. My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:
The glove which I have given him for a favour
May haply purchase him a box o’ th’ ear;
It is the soldier’s; I by bargain should
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
For I do know Fluellen valiant
And, touch’d with choler, hot as gunpowder.
And quickly will return an injury:
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter. [Exeunt.

### Scene viii. Before King Henry's pavilion

Enter Gower and Williams.

Will. I warrant it is to knight you, captain.

Enter Fluellen.

Flu. God’s will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the King: there is more good toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.
Will. Sir, know you this glove?
Flu. Know the glove! I know the glove is a glove.
Will. I know this; and thus I challenge it. [Strikes him.]
Flu. ’Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the universal world, or in France, or in England!
Gower. How now, sir! you villain!
Will. Do you think I’ll be forsworn?
Flu. Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his payment in blows, I warrant you.
Will. I am no traitor.
Flu. That’s a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his Majesty’s name, apprehend him: he’s a friend of the Duke of *Alençon’s*.

Enter Warwick and Gloucester.

War. How now, how now! what’s the matter?
Flu. My Lord of Warwick, here is—praised be God for it!—a most contagious treason come to light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s day. Here is his Majesty.

Enter King Henry and Exeter.

K. Hen. How now! what’s the matter?
Flu. My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty took out of the helmet of *Alençon*.
Will. My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
Flu. Your Majesty hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascaly, beggarly, lousy knave it is: I hope your Majesty will bear me testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that this is the glove of *Alençon*, that your Majesty did give me; in your conscience, now.
K. Hen. Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the fellow of it.
’Twas I, indeed, thou promised’st to strike;
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
Flu. An please your Majesty, let his neck answer for it, if there is any martial law in the world.
K. Hen. How canst thou make me satisfaction?
Will. All offences, my lord, come from the heart: never came any from mine that might offend your Majesty.
K. Hen. It was ourself thou didst abuse.
Will. Your Majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to me but as a common man; witness the night, your garments, your lowliness; and what your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I took you for, I made no offence; therefore, I beseech your Highness, pardon me.
K. Hen. Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns.
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.
Flu. By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence for you; and I pray you to serve God, and keep you out of brawls, and brabbles, and quarrels, and dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.
Will. I will none of your money.
Flu. It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should you be so bashful? your shoes is not so good: ’tis a good shilling, I warrant you, or I will change it.

Enter an English Herald.

K. Hen. Now, herald, are the dead number’d?
Her. Here is the number of the slaughter’d French.
K. Hen. What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?
Exe. *Charles Duke of Orleans*, nephew to the King;
*John Duke of Bourbon*, and *Lord Bouciqualt*:
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.
K. Hen. This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
One hundred twenty six: added to these,
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb’d knights:
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
*Charles Delabreth*, High Constable of France;
*Jacques de Châtillon*, admiral of France;
The master of the cross-bows, *Lord Rambures*;
Great Master of France, the brave Sir *Guichard Dauphin*,
*John Duke of Alençon*, *Anthony Duke of Brabant*,
The brother to the Duke of *Burgundy*,
And *Edward Duke of Bar*: of lusty earls,
*Grandpré* and *Roussi*, *Fauconberg* and *Foix*,
*Beaumont* and *Marle*, *Vaudemont* and *Lestrale*.
Here was a royal fellowship of death!
Where is the number of our English dead?

Herald shews him another paper.

*Edward the Duke of York*, the *Earl of Suffolk*,
Sir *Richard Ketly*, *Davy Gam*, esquire:
None else of name; and of all other men
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
But in plain shock and even play of battle,
Was ever known so great and little loss
On one part and on the other? Take it, God,
For it is none but thine!
Exe. ’Tis wonderful!
K. Hen. Come, go we in procession to the village:
And be it death proclaimed through our host
To boast of this or take that praise from God
Which is his only.
Flu. Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to tell how many is killed?
K. Hen. Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,
That God fought for us.
Flu. Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.
K. Hen. Do we all holy rites;
Let there be sung *Non nobis* and *Te Deum*;
The dead with charity enclosed in clay:
And then to Calais; and to England then;
Where ne’er from France arrived more happy men. [Exeunt.

## Act V

### Prologue

Enter Chorus.

Chor. Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,
That I may prompt them: and of such as have,
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented. Now we bear the King
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth’d sea,
Which like a mighty whiffler ’fore the King
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
And solemnly see him set on to London.
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city: he forbids it,
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;
Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
How London doth pour out her citizens!
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
Were now the general of our gracious Empress,
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
How many would the peaceful city quit,
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;

As yet the lamentation of the French
Invites the King of England’s stay at home;
The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France,
To order peace between them; and omit
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,
Till Harry’s back-return again to France:
There must we bring him; and myself have play’d
The interim, by remembering you ’tis past.
Then brook abridgement, and your eyes advance
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
*[Exit.]*

## Scene i. France: the English camp

*Enter Fluellen and Gower.*

**Gow.** Nay, that’s right; but why wear you
your leek to-day? Saint Davy’s day is past.

**Flu.** There are occasions and causes why and
wherefore in all things: I will tell you, as my
friend, Captain Gower; the rascally, scald, beg-
garly, lousy, bragging knave, Pistol, which you
and yourself and all the world know to be no
better than a fellow, look you now, of no merits,
he is come to me and brings me bread and salt
yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek. It
was in a place where I could not breed contention
with him; but I will be so bold as to wear it
in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will
tell him a little piece of my desires.

*Enter Pistol.*

**Gow.** Why, here he comes, swelling like a
turkey-cock.

**Flu.** ’Tis no matter for his swellings nor his
turkey-cocks. God bless you, Ancient Pistol!
you scurvy, lousy knave, God bless you!

**Pist.** Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst,
base Trojan,
To have me fold up Parca’s fatal web?
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.

**Flu.** I beseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave,
at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions,
to eat, look you, this leek; because, look you,
you do not love it, nor your affections and your
appetites and your digestions do not agree
with it, I would desire you to eat it.

**Pist.** Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.

**Flu.** There is one goat for you. *[Strikes him.]*
Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it?

**Pist.** Base Trojan, thou shalt die.

**Flu.** You say very true, scald knave, when
God’s will is. I will desire you to live in the mean
time, and eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce
for it. *[Strikes him.]* You called me yesterday
mountain-squire; but I will make you to-day a
squire of low degree. I pray you, fall to; if you
can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.

**Gow.** Enough, captain: you have astonished
him.

**Flu.** I say, I will make him eat some part of my
leek, or I will beat his pate four days. Bite, I
pray you; it is good for your green wound and
your bloody coxcomb.

**Pist.** Must I bite?

**Flu.** Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of
question too, and ambiguities.

**Pist.** By this leek, I will most horribly revenge:
I eat and eat, I swear —

**Flu.** Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more
sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to
swear by.

**Pist.** Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.

**Flu.** Much good do you, scald knave, heartily.
Nay, pray you, throw none away; the skin is
good for your broken coxcomb. When you take
occasions to see leeks hereafter, I pray you,
mock at ’em; that is all.

**Pist.** Good.

**Flu.** Ay, leeks are good: hold you, there is a
groat to heal your pate.

**Pist.** I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.

**Flu.** Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it;
or I have another leek in my pocket, which you
shall eat.

**Flu.** If I owe you anything, I will pay you in
cudgels; you shall be a woodmonger, and buy
nothing of me but cudgels. God b’ wi’ you, and
keep you, and heal your pate. *[Exit.]*

**Pist.** All hell shall stir for this.

**Gow.** Go, go; you are a counterfeit, cowardly
knave. Will you mock at an ancient tradition,
begun upon an honourable respect, and worn as a
memorable trophy of predeceased valour, and dare
not avouch in your deeds any of your words? I
have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentle-
man twice or thrice. You thought, because he
could not speak English in the native garb, he
could not therefore handle an English cudgel:
you find it otherwise; and henceforth let a Welsh
correction teach you a good English condition.
Fare ye well. *[Exit.]*

**Pist.** Doth Fortune play the housewife with me
now?
News have I, that my Nell is dead i’ the spital
Of malady of France;
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs
Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I’ll turn,
And something learn to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I’ll steal:
And patches will I get unto these cudgell’d scars,
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
*[Exit.]*

## Scene ii. France: a royal palace

*Enter, at one door, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford,
Gloucester, Warwick, Westmoreland, and
Other Lords; at another, the French King, Queen
Isabel, the Princess Katharine, Alice and
other Ladies; the Duke of Burgundy, and his
train.*

**K. Hen.** Peace to this meeting, wherefore we
are met!
Unto our brother France, and to our sister,
Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
By whom this great assembly is contrived,
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!

**Fr. King.** Right joyous are we to behold your
face,
Most worthy brother England; fairly met:
So are you, princes English, every one.

**Q. Isa.** So happy be the issue, brother England,
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
As we are now glad to behold your eyes;
Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
Against the French that met them in their bent
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
Have lost their quality, and that this day
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.

**K. Hen.** To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

**Q. Isa.** You English princes all, I do salute you.

**Bur.** My duty to you both, on equal love,
Great Kings of France and England! That I
have labour’d,
With all my wits, my pains, and strong endea-
vours
To bring your most imperial Majesties
Unto this bar and royal interview,
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
Since then my office hath so far prevail’d
That, face to face and royal eye to eye,
You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,
If I demand, before this royal view,
What rub or what impediment there is,
Why that naked, poor, and mangled Peace,
Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,
Should not in this best garden of the world,
Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
Corrupting in its own fertility.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach’d,
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
Put forth disorder’d twigs; her fallow leas
The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory
Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
That should deracinate such savagery;
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,
Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
Losing both beauty and utility.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and
hedges,
Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
The sciences that should become our country;
But grow like savages — as soldiers will
That nothing do but meditate on blood —
To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire
And everything that seems unnatural.
Which to reduce into our former favour
You are assembled; and my speech entreats
That I may know the let why gentle Peace
Should not expel these inconveniences
And bless us with her former qualities.

**K. Hen.** If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the
peace,
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
With full accord to all our just demands;
Whose tenours and particular effects
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

**Bur.** The King hath heard them; to the which
as yet
There is no answer made.

**K. Hen.** Well then the peace,
Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.

**Fr. King.** I have but with a cursory eye
O’erglanced the articles. Pleaseth your Grace
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more, with better heed
To re-survey them, we will suddenly
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.

**K. Hen.** Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,
And brother Clarence, and you, brother Glou-
cester,
Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the King;
And take with you free power to ratify,
Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
Shall see advantageable for our dignity,
Anything in or out of our demands.
And we’ll consign thereto. Will you, fair
sister,
Go with the princes, or stay here with us?

**Q. Isa.** Our gracious brother, I will go with
them:
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good,
When articles too nicely urged be stood on.

**K. Hen.** Yet leave our cousin Katharine here
with us:
She is our capital demand, comprised
Within the fore-rank of our articles.

**Q. Isa.** She hath good leave.
*[Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine,
and Alice.]*

**K. Hen.** Fair Katharine, and most fair,
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
Such as will enter at a lady’s ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

**Kath.** Your Majesty shall mock at me; I can-
not speak your English.

**K. Hen.** O fair Katharine, if you will love me
soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to
hear you confess it brokenly with your English
tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

**Kath.** *Pardonnez-moi*, I cannot tell vat is “like
me.”

**K. Hen.** An angel is like you, Kate, and you are
like an angel.

**Kath.** *Que dit-il? que je suis semblable aux anges?*

**Alice.** *Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce, ainsi dit-il.*

**K. Hen.** I said so, dear Katharine; and I must
not blush to affirm it.

**Kath.** *O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont
pleines de tromperies.*

**K. Hen.** What says she, fair one? that the ton-
gues of men are full of deceits?

**Alice.** Out, dat de tongues of de men is full
of deceits: dat is de princess.

**K. Hen.** The princess is the better English-
woman. I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy
understanding: I am glad thou canst speak no
better English: for, if thou couldst, thou wouldst
find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think
I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know
no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say
“I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to
say “do you in faith?” I wear out my suit. Give
me your answer; i’ faith, do: and so clap hands
and a bargain. How say you, lady?

**Kath.** *Sauf votre honneur*, me understand veil.

**K. Hen.** Marry, if you would put me to verses
or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid
me; for the one, I have neither words nor mea-
sure, and for the other, I have no strength in
measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.
If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting
into my saddle with my armour on my back,
under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I
should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might
buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her
favours, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like
a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,
nor I have no cunning in protestation; only down-
right oaths, which I never use till urged, nor
never break for urging. If thou canst love a
fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not
worth sun-burning, that never looks in his glass
for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye
be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier; if
thou canst love me for this, take me; if not, to
say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy
love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And
while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of
plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce
must do thee right, because he hath not the gift
to woo in other places; for these fellows of infi-
nite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into
ladies’ favours, they do always reason themselves
out again. What! a speaker is but a prater; a
rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a
straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn
white; a curled pate will grow bald; a fair face
will wither; a full eye will wax hollow: but a
good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or
rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines
bright and never changes, but keeps his course
truly. If thou wouldst have such a one, take me;
and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a
king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

**Kath.** Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of
France?

**K. Hen.** No; it is not possible you should love
the enemy of France, Kate: but, in loving me,
you should love the friend of France; for I love
France so well that I will not part with a village
of it; I will have it all mine: and, Kate, when
France is mine and I am yours, then yours is
France and you are mine.

**Kath.** I cannot tell vat is dat.

**K. Hen.** No, Kate? I will tell thee in French;
which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like
a new-married wife about her husband’s neck,
hardly to be shook off. *Je quand sur la possession
de France, et quand vous avez la possession de moi —*
let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my
speed! — *donc votre est France et vous êtes mienne*.
It is easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom
as to speak so much more French; I shall never
move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.

**Kath.** *Sauf votre honneur, le Français que vous par-
lez, il est meilleur que l’Anglois lequel je parle.*

**K. Hen.** No, faith, is’t not, Kate; but thy speak-
ing of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely,
must needs be granted to be much at one. But,
Kate, dost thou understand thus much English:
canst thou love me?

**Kath.** I cannot tell.

**K. Hen.** Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate?
I’ll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and
at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll
question this gentlewoman about me; and I know
Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me
that you love with your heart: but, good Kate,
mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle princess,
because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest
mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me
tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling,
and thou must therefore needs prove a good
soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I, between
Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy,
half French, half English, that shall go to Con-
stantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
Shall we not? What sayest thou, my fair flower-
de-luce?

**Kath.** I do not know dat.

**K. Hen.** No; ’tis hereafter to know, but now to
promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will
endeavour for your French part of such a boy;
and for my English moiety take the word of a
king and bachelor. How answer you, *la plus
belle Katharine du monde, mon très-cher et divin
déesse?*

**Kath.** Your majestee ave *fausse* French enough
to deceive de most sage *demoiselle* dat is en
France.

**K. Hen.** Now, fie upon my false French! By
mine honour, in true English, I love thee, Kate;
by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me;
yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost,
notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect
of my visage. Now, beshrew my father’s am-
bition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got
me; therefore was I created with a stubborn out-
side, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to
woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the
elder I wax, the better I shall appear: my com-
fort is, that old age, that ill layer up of beauty,
can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me,
if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear
me, if thou wear me, better and better; and there-
fore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have
me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an em-
press; take me by the hand, and say, “Harry of
England, I am thine”; which word thou shalt no
sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee
aloud, “England is thine, Ireland is thine, France
is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine”; who,
though I speak it before his face, if he be not
fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the
best king of good fellows. Come, your answer
in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy
English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katha-
rine, break thy mind to me in broken English;
wilt thou have me?

**Kath.** Dat is as it shall please de *roi mon père*.

**K. Hen.** Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it
shall please him, Kate.

**Kath.** Den it shall also content me.

**K. Hen.** Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call
you my queen.

**Kath.** *Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi,
je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur
en baisant la main d’une de votre seigneurie indigne
serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon très-
puissant seigneur.*

**K. Hen.** Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

**Kath.** *Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées
devant leurs noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France.*

**K. Hen.** Madam my interpreter, what says
she?

**Alice.** Dat it is not be de fashion pour les
ladies of France — I cannot tell vat is *baiser* en
Anglish.

**K. Hen.** To kiss.

**Alice.** Your Majesty *entendez mieux* que moi.

**K. Hen.** It is not a fashion for the maids in
France to kiss before they are married, would
she say?

**Alice.** O, *vraiment*!

**K. Hen.** O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great
kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined
within the weak list of a country’s fashion: we
are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty
that follows our places stops the mouth of all
find-faults; as I will do yours, for upholding the
nice fashion of your country in denying me a
kiss. Therefore, patiently and yielding. *[Kissing
her.]* You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate:
there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them
than in the tongues of the French council; and
they should sooner persuade Harry of England
than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes
your father.

*Re-enter the French King and his Queen, Bur-
gundy, and other Lords.*

**Bur.** God save your Majesty! My royal cousin,
teach you our princess English?

**K. Hen.** I would have her learn, my fair cousin,
how perfectly I love her; and that is good Eng-
lish.

**Bur.** Is she not apt?

**K. Hen.** Our tongue is rough, coz, and my
condition is not smooth; so that, having neither
the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I
cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her,
that he will appear in his true likeness.

**Bur.** Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I
answer you for that. If you would conjure in
her, you must make a circle; if conjure up love
in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked
and blind. Can you blame her then, being a
maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of
modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked
blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my
lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.

**K. Hen.** Yet they do wink and yield, as love
is blind and enforces.

**Bur.** They are then excused, my lord, when
they see not what they do.

**K. Hen.** Then, good my lord, teach your cousin
to consent winking.

**Bur.** I will wink on her to consent, my lord,
if you will teach her to know my meaning; for
maids, well summered and warm kept, are like
flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they
have their eyes; and then they will endure hand-
ling, which before would not abide looking on.

**K. Hen.** This moral ties me over to time and a
hot summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your
cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind
too.

**Bur.** As love is, my lord, before it loves.

**K. Hen.** It is so; and you may, some of you,
thank love for my blindness, who cannot see
many a fair French city for one fair French maid
that stands in my way.

**Fr. King.** Yes, my lord, you see them per-
spectively, the cities turned into a maid; for they
are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath
never entered.

**K. Hen.** Shall Kate be my wife?

**Fr. King.** So please you.

**K. Hen.** I am content; so the maiden cities
you talk of may wait on her; so the maid that
stood in the way for my wish shall show me the
way to my will.

**Fr. King.** We have consented to all terms of
reason.

**K. Hen.** Is’t so, my lords of England?

**West.** The King hath granted every article:
His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
According to their firm proposed natures.

**Exe.** Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
Where your Majesty demands, that the King of
France, having any occasion to write for matter
of grant, shall name your Highness in this form
and with this addition, in French, *Notre très-
cher fils Henri, Roi d’Angleterre, Héritier de
France*; and thus in Latin, *Praeclarissimus filius
noster Henricus, Rex Angliae, et Haeres Franciae*.

**Fr. King.** Nor this I have not, brother, so
denied,
But your request shall make me let it pass.

**K. Hen.** I pray you then, in love and dear alli-
ance,
Let that one article rank with the rest;
And thereupon give me your daughter.

**Fr. King.** Take her, fair son, and from her
blood raise up
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England, whose very shores look
pale
With envy of each other’s happiness,
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunc-
tion
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair
France.

**All.** Amen!

**K. Hen.** Now, welcome, Kate; and bear me
witness all,
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
*[Flourish.]*

**Q. Isa.** God, the best maker of all marriages,
Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,
To make divorce of their incorporate league;
That English may as French, French English-
men,
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!

**All.** Amen!

**K. Hen.** Prepare we for our marriage; on which
day,
My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath,
And all the peers’, for surety of our leagues.
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!
*[Sennet. Exeunt.]*

## EPILOGUE

*Enter Chorus.*

**Chor.** Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
Our bending author hath pursued the story,
In little room confining mighty men,
Mangling by starts the full course of their
glory.
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
This star of England: Fortune made his sword;
By which the world’s best garden he achieved,
And of it left his son imperial lord.
Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown’d King
Of France and England, did this king suc-
ceed;
Whose state so many had the managing,
That they lost France and made his England
bleed:
Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their
sake,
In your fair minds let this acceptance take.
