# Volume 42 - Kant

## IMMANUEL KANT (1724-1804)

Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, one of the most influential thinkers in the history of Western philosophy. His "critical philosophy" revolutionized epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics, and his work remains central to philosophical discussion today.

### Works in This Volume

- **Critique of Pure Reason** - Kant's groundbreaking work on epistemology and metaphysics, examining the limits and possibilities of human knowledge. He argues that while knowledge begins with experience, certain concepts and principles are contributed by the mind itself.

- **Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals** - Kant's foundation for his moral philosophy, introducing the categorical imperative: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

- **Critique of Practical Reason** - Kant's systematic examination of practical (moral) reason, establishing the autonomy of the moral will and the postulates of God, freedom, and immortality as requirements of moral life.

- **Critique of Judgment** - Kant's third critique, examining aesthetic and teleological judgment. He analyzes the nature of beauty, the sublime, and purposiveness in nature, bridging his theoretical and practical philosophy.
