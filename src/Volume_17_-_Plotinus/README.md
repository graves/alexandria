Plotinus was the founder of Neoplatonism, the last great philosophical movement of antiquity. Born in Egypt and educated in Alexandria, he later established a school in Rome. His philosophy profoundly influenced Christian, Jewish, and Islamic thought.

### Works in This Volume

- **The Six Enneads** - The collected writings of Plotinus, organized by his student Porphyry into six groups of nine treatises each.

Topics include:
  - The nature of the One, the source of all being
  - Intellect (Nous) and the realm of Forms
  - The Soul and its relation to body
  - The nature of beauty and its role in spiritual ascent
  - The problem of evil
  - Time and eternity
  - The return of the soul to its divine source
