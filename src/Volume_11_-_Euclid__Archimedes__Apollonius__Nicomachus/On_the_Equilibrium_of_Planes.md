### Proposition 1

If P, P' be two parabolic segments and D, E their centres of gravity respectively, the centre of gravity of the two segments taken together will be at a point C on DE determined by the relation
P : P' = CE : CD.

In the same straight line with DE measure EH, EL each equal to DC, and DK equal to DH; whence it follows at once that DK = CE, and also that
KC = CL.

Apply a rectangle MN equal in area to the parabolic segment P to a base equal to KH, and place the rectangle so that KH bisects it, and is parallel to its base.

Then D is the centre of gravity of MN, since KD = DH.

Produce the sides of the rectangle which are parallel to KH, and complete the rectangle NO whose base is equal to HL. Then E is the centre of gravity of the rectangle NO.

Now (MN) : (NO) = KH : HL
= DH : EH
= CE : CD
= P : P'.

But (MN) = P.

Therefore (NO) = P'.

Also, since C is the middle point of KL, C is the centre of gravity of the whole parallelogram made up of the two parallelograms (MN), (NO), which are equal to, and have the same centres of gravity as, P, P' respectively.

Hence C is the centre of gravity of P, P' taken together.

### DEFINITION AND LEMMAS PRELIMINARY TO PROPOSITION 2

> “If in a segment bounded by a straight line and a section of a right-angled cone [a parabola] a triangle be inscribed having the same base as the segment and equal height, if again triangles be inscribed in the remaining segments having the same bases as the segments and equal height, and if in the remaining segments triangles be inscribed in the same manner, let the resulting figure be said to be inscribed in the recognised manner in the segment.
>
> “And it is plain”
>
> (1) “that the lines joining the two angles of the figure so inscribed which are nearest to the vertex of the segment, and the next pairs of angles in order, will be parallel to the base of the segment,”
>
> (2) “that the said lines will be bisected by the diameter of the segment, and”
>
> (3) “that they will cut the diameter in the proportions of the successive odd numbers, the number one having reference to [the length adjacent to] the vertex of the segment.
>
> “And these properties will have to be proved in their proper places.”

### Proposition 2

If a figure be “inscribed in the recognised manner” in a parabolic segment, the centre of gravity of the figure so inscribed will lie on the diameter of the segment.

For, in the figure of the foregoing lemmas, the centre of gravity of the trapezium BRR'B' must lie on AO, that of the trapezium RQQ'R' on WX, and so on, while the centre of gravity of the triangle PAP' lies on AV.

Hence the centre of gravity of the whole figure lies on AO.

### Proposition 3

If BAB', bab' be two similar parabolic segments whose diameters are AO, ao respectively, and if a figure be inscribed in each segment “in the recognised manner,” the number of sides in each figure being equal, the centres of gravity of the inscribed figures will divide AO, ao in the same ratio.
Suppose BRQPAP'Q'R'B', brqpap'q'r'b' to be the two figures inscribed “in the recognised manner.” Join PP', QQ', RR' meeting AO in L, M, N, and pp', qq', rr' meeting ao in l, m, n.

Then [Lemma (3)]
AL : LM : MN : NO = 1 : 3 : 5 : 7
= al : lm : mn : no,
so that AO, ao are divided in the same proportion.

Also, by reversing the proof of Lemma (3), we see that
PP' : pp' = QQ' : qq' = RR' : rr' = BB' : bb'.

Since then RR' : BB' = rr' : bb', and these ratios respectively determine the proportion in which NO, no are divided by the centres of gravity of the trapezia BRR'B', brr'b' [I. 15], it follows that the centres of gravity of the trapezia divide NO, no in the same ratio.

Similarly the centres of gravity of the trapezia RQQ'R', rqq'r' divide MN, mn in the same ratio respectively, and so on.

Lastly, the centres of gravity of the triangles PAP', pap' divide AL, al respectively in the same ratio.

Moreover the corresponding trapezia and triangles are, each to each, in the same proportion (since their sides and heights are respectively proportional), while AO, ao are divided in the same proportion.

Therefore the centres of gravity of the complete inscribed figures divide AO, ao in the same proportion.
---
<sup>1</sup>Archimedes enunciates this proposition as true of similar segments, but it is equally true of segments which are not similar, as the course of the proof will show.

### Proposition 4

The centre of gravity of any parabolic segment cut off by a straight line lies on the diameter of the segment.

Let BAB' be a parabolic segment, A its vertex and AO its diameter.

Then, if the centre of gravity of the segment does not lie on AO, suppose it to be, if possible, the point F. Draw FE parallel to AO meeting BB' in E.

Inscribe in the segment the triangle ABB' having the same vertex and height as the segment, and take an area S such that
Δ ABB' : S = BE : EO.

We can then inscribe in the segment “in the recognised manner” a figure such that the segments of the parabola left over are together less than S.
---
<sup>1</sup>For Prop. 20 of the *Quadrature of the Parabola* proves that, if in any segment the triangle with the same base and height be inscribed, the triangle is greater than half the segment; whence it appears that, each time that we increase the number of the sides of the figure inscribed “in the recognised manner,” we take away more than half of the remaining segments.

Let the inscribed figure be drawn accordingly; its centre of gravity then lies on AO [Prop. 2]. Let it be the point H.

Join HF and produce it to meet in K the line through B parallel to AO.

Then we have
(inscribed figure) : (remainder of segment) > Δ ABB' : S
> BE : EO
> KF : FH.

Suppose L taken on HK produced so that the former ratio is equal to the ratio LF : FH.

Then, since H is the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure, and F that of the segment, L must be the centre of gravity of all the segments taken together which form the remainder of the original segment. [I. 8]

But this is impossible, since all these segments lie on one side of the line drawn through L parallel to AO [Cf. Post. 7].

Hence the centre of gravity of the segment cannot but lie on AO.

### Proposition 5

If in a parabolic segment a figure be inscribed “in the recognised manner” the centre of gravity of the segment is nearer to the vertex of the segment than the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure is.

Let BAB' be the given segment, and AO its diameter. First, let ABB' be the triangle inscribed “in the recognised manner.”

Divide AO in F so that AF = 2FO; F is then the centre of gravity of the triangle ABB'.

Bisect AB, AB' in D, D' respectively, and join DD' meeting AO in E. Draw DQ, D'Q' parallel to OA to meet the curve. QD, Q'D' will then be the diameters of the segments whose bases are AB, AB', and the centres of gravity of those segments will lie respectively on QD, Q'D' [Prop. 4]. Let them be H, H', and join HH' meeting AO in K.

Now QD, Q'D' are equal,<sup>1</sup> and therefore the segments of which they are the diameters are equal [*On Conoids and Spheroids*, Prop. 3].

Also, since QD, Q'D' are parallel, and DE = ED', K is the middle point of HH'.

Hence the centre of gravity of the equal segments AQB, AQ'B' taken together is K, where K lies between E and A. And the centre of gravity of the triangle ABB' is F.

It follows that the centre of gravity of the whole segment BAB' lies between K and F, and is therefore nearer to the vertex A than F is.

Secondly, take the five-sided figure BQAQ'B' inscribed “in the recognised manner,” QD, Q'D' being, as before, the diameters of the segments AQB, AQ'B'.

Then, by the first part of this proposition, the centre of gravity of the segment AQB (lying of course on QD) is nearer to Q than the centre of gravity of the triangle AQB is. Let the centre of gravity of the segment be H, and that of the triangle I.
---
<sup>1</sup>This may either be inferred from Lemma (1) above (since QQ', DD' are both parallel to BB'), or from Prop. 19 of the *Quadrature of the Parabola*, which applies equally to Q or Q'.

Similarly let H' be the centre of gravity of the segment AQ'B', and I' that of the triangle AQ'B'.

It follows that the centre of gravity of the two segments AQB, AQ'B' taken together is K, the middle point of HH', and that of the two triangles AQB, AQ'B' is L, the middle point of II'.

If now the centre of gravity of the triangle ABB' be F, the centre of gravity of the whole segment BAB' (i.e. that of the triangle ABB' and the two segments AQB, AQ'B' taken together) is a point G on KF determined by the proportion
(sum of segments AQB, AQ'B') : ΔABB' = FG : GK.
[I. 6, 7]

And the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure BQAQ'B' is a point F' on FL determined by the proportion
(ΔAQB + ΔAQ'B') : ΔABB' = FF' : F'L. [I. 6, 7]

[Hence FG : GK > FF' : F'L,
or GK : FG < F'L : FF',
and, *componendo*, FK : FG < FL : FF', while FK > FL.]

Therefore FG > FF', or G lies nearer than F' to the vertex A.

Using this last result, and proceeding in the same way, we can prove the proposition for any figure inscribed “in the recognised manner.”

### Proposition 6

Given a segment of a parabola cut off by a straight line, it is possible to inscribe in it “in the recognised manner” a figure such that the distance between the centres of gravity of the segment and of the inscribed figure is less than any assigned length.

Let BAB' be the segment, AO its diameter, G its centre of gravity, and ABB' the triangle inscribed “in the recognised manner.”

Let D be the assigned length and S an area such that
AG : D = ΔABB' : S.

In the segment inscribe “in the recognised manner” a figure such that the sum of the segments left over is less than S.

Let F be the centre of gravity of the inscribed figure.

We shall prove that FG < D.

For, if not, FG must be either equal to, or greater than, D.

And clearly
(inscribed figure) : (sum of remaining segments)
> ΔABB' : S
> AG : D
> AG : FG, by hypothesis (since FG < D).

Let the first ratio be equal to the ratio KG : FG (where K lies on GA produced); and it follows that K is the centre of gravity of the small segments taken together. [I. 8]

But this is impossible, since the segments are all on the same side of a line drawn through K parallel to BB'.

Hence FG cannot but be less than D.

### Proposition 7

If there be two similar parabolic segments, their centres of gravity divide their diameters in the same ratio.

Let BAB', bab' be the two similar segments, AO, ao their diameters, and G, g their centres of gravity respectively.

Then, if G, g do not divide AO, ao respectively in the same ratio, suppose H to be such a point on AO that
AH : HO = ag : go;
and inscribe in the segment BAB' “in the recognised manner” a figure such that, if F be its centre of gravity,
GF < GH. [Prop. 6]
Inscribe in the segment bab' “in the recognised manner” a similar figure; then, if f be the centre of gravity of this figure,
ag < af. [Prop. 5]

And, by Prop. 3, af : fo = AF : FO.

But AF : FO < AH : HO
< ag : go, by hypothesis.

Therefore af : fo < ag : go; which is impossible.

It follows that G, g cannot but divide AO, ao in the same ratio.

### Proposition 8

If AO be the diameter of a parabolic segment, and G its centre of gravity, then
AG = 3/2 GO.

Let the segment be BAB'. Inscribe the triangle ABB' “in the recognised manner,” and let F be its centre of gravity.

Bisect AB, AB' in D, D', and draw DQ, D'Q' parallel to OA to meet the curve, so that QD, Q'D' are the diameters of the segments AQB, AQ'B' respectively.

Let H, H' be the centres of gravity of the segments AQB, AQ'B' respectively. Join QQ', HH' meeting AO in V, K respectively.

K is then the centre of gravity of the two segments AQB, AQ'B' taken together.

By Proposition 7, the centres of gravity of similar parabolic segments divide their diameters in the same ratio.
Since G is the centre of gravity of segment BAB' with diameter AO, and H is the centre of gravity of segment AQB with diameter QD, we have AG : AO = QH : QD.
It is a known property that the centre of gravity of a parabolic segment is at a point on its diameter such that the distance from the vertex is 3/5 of the diameter. Thus, QH = 3/5 QD.
Therefore, AG : AO = 3/5 QD : QD = 3 : 5.
Hence AG = 3/5 AO.
It follows that GO = AO - AG = AO - 3/5 AO = 2/5 AO.
Therefore, AG : GO = (3/5 AO) : (2/5 AO) = 3 : 2.
So AG = 3/2 GO.

### Proposition 9 (Lemma)

If a, b, c, d be four lines in continued proportion and in descending order of magnitude, and if
d : (a - d) = x : 1/3(a - c),
and (2a+4b+6c+3d) : (5a+10b+10c+5d) = y : 1/3(a - c),
it is required to prove that
x+y = 1/3 a.

[The following is the proof given by Archimedes, with the only difference that it is set out in algebraical instead of geometrical notation. This is done in the particular case simply in order to make the proof easier to follow. Archimedes exhibits his lines in the figure reproduced in the margin, but, now that it is possible to use algebraical notation, there is no advantage in using the figure and the more cumbrous notation which only obscures the course of the proof. The relation between Archimedes' figure and the letters used below is as follows:
AB = a, QB = b, RB = c, EB = d, ZH = z, Hθ = y, AO = x.]

We have
a/b = b/c = c/d (i)
whence
(a - b)/b = (b - c)/c = (c - d)/d
and therefore
(a - b)/(b - c) = b/c = c/d
(b - c)/(c - d) = b/c = c/d

Now
(a - c)/(c - d) = (2a+3b+c)/(2c+d) (2)

And, in like manner,
(b+c)/d = (a-c)/(c-d).

It follows from the last two relations that
(a - c)/(c - d) = (2a+3b+c)/(2c+d)

Suppose z to be so taken that
(2a+4b+4c+2d)/(2c+d) = (a - c)/z (3)
so that z < (c - d).
Therefore
(a - c + z)/z = (2a+4b+6c+3d)/(2c+d) (4)
And, by hypothesis,
(a - c)/y = (5(a+d) + 10(b+c)) / (2a+4b+6c+3d)
so that
(a - c + z)/y = (5(a+d) + 10(b+c)) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c)) = 5/2 (5)

Again, dividing (3) by (4) crosswise, we obtain
z/(c - d) = (2a+3b+c) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c)) (6)
whence
(c - d - z)/(c - d) = (b+3c+2d) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c))
But, by (2),
(c - d)/d = (a - b)/b + 3(b - c)/c + 2(c - d)/d
so that
(c - d)/d = (a - b + 3(b - c) + 2(c - d)) / (b+3c+2d) (7)
Combining (6) and (7), we have
(c - d - z)/d = (a - b + 3(b - c) + 2(c - d)) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c)) (8)
whence
(c - z)/d = (3a+6b+3c) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c))
And, since [by (1)]
(c - d)/(c+d) = (b - c)/(b+c) = (a - b)/(a+b),
we have
(c - d)/(a - c) = (c+d)/(b+c+a+b)
(a - d)/(a - c) = (a+2b+2c+d)/(a+2b+c) = (2(a+d)+4(b+c))/(2(a+c)+4b)
Thus
(a - d) / (1/3(a - c)) = (2(a+d)+4(b+c)) / (1/3(2(a+c)+4b))
and therefore, by hypothesis,
x = d * 1/3(a - c) / (a - d)
(a - d)/x = (2(a+d)+4(b+c)) / (1/3(2(a+c)+4b))
But, by (8),
(c - z)/d = (3a+6b+3c) / (2(a+d)+4(b+c))
and it follows, *ex aequali*, that
(c - z)/x = (3(a+c)+6b) / (1/3(2(a+c)+4b)) = 5/2.
And, by (5),
(a - c + z)/y = 5/2.
Therefore
x+y = 2/5 a.

### Proposition 10

If PP'B'B be the portion of a parabola intercepted between two parallel chords PP', BB' bisected respectively in N, O by the diameter ANO (N being nearer than O to A, the vertex of the segments), and if NO be divided into five equal parts of which LM is the middle one (L being nearer than M to N), then, if G be a point on LM such that
LG : GM = BO^2 * (2PN+BO) : PN^2 * (2BO+PN),
G will be the centre of gravity of the area PP'B'B.

Take a line ao equal to AO, and an on it equal to AN. Let p, q be points on the line ao such that
ao : aq = aq : an, (1)
ao : an = aq : ap, (2)
[whence ao : aq = aq : an = an : ap, or ao, aq, an, ap are lines in continued proportion and in descending order of magnitude].

Measure along GA a length GF such that
(ao - ap) : ap = OL : GF. (3)

Then, since PN, BO are ordinates to ANO,
BO^2 : PN^2 = AO : AN
= ao : an
= ao^2 : aq^2, by (1),
so that
BO : PN = ao : aq, (4)
and
BO^3 : PN^3 = ao^3 : aq^3
= (ao : aq) * (aq : an) * (an : ap)
= ao : ap. (5)
Thus
(segment BAB') : (segment PAP')
= Δ BAB' : Δ PAP'
= BO^3 : PN^3
= ao : ap,
whence
(area PP'B'B) : (segment PAP') = (ao - ap) : ap
= OL : GF, by (3),
= 1/3 ON : GF. (6)

Now
BO^2 * (2PN+BO) : BO^3
= (2PN+BO) : BO
= (2aq+ao) : ao, by (4),
and
BO^3 : PN^3
= ao : ap, by (5),
and
PN^3 : PN^2 * (2BO+PN)
= PN : (2BO+PN)
= aq : (2ao+aq), by (4),
= ap : (2an+ap), by (2).
Hence, *ex aequali*,
BO^2 * (2PN+BO) : PN^2 * (2BO+PN) = (2aq+ao) : (2an+ap),
so that
LG : GM = (2aq+ao) : (2an+ap).

*Componendo*, and multiplying the antecedents by 5,
ON : GM = {5(ao+ap) + 10(aq+an)} : (2an+ap).
But
ON : OM = 5 : 2 = {5(ao+ap)+10(aq+an)} : {2(ao+ap)+4(aq+an)}.
It follows that
ON : OG = {5(ao+ap) + 10(aq+an)} : (2ao+4aq+6an+3ap).
Therefore
(2ao+4aq+6an+3ap) : {5(ao+ap) + 10(aq+an)} = OG : ON.
And ap : (ao-ap) = ap : (ao-ap)
= GF : OL, by hypothesis,
= GF : 1/3 ON,
while ao, aq, an, ap are in continued proportion.

Therefore, by Prop. 9,
GF+OG = OF = 1/3 ao = 1/3 AO.
Thus F is the centre of gravity of the segment BAB'.

Let H be the centre of gravity of the segment PAP', so that AH = 3/5 AN.
And, since AF = 3/5 AO,
we have, by subtraction, HF = 2/5 ON.

But, by (6) above,
(area PP'B'B) : (segment PAP') = 1/3 ON : GF
= HF : FG.

Thus, since F, H are the centres of gravity of the segments BAB', PAP' respectively, it follows [by I. 6, 7] that G is the centre of gravity of the area PP'B'B.
