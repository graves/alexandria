## Proposition 1

If two circles touch at A, and if BD, EF be parallel diameters in them, ADF is a straight line.

Let O, C be the centres of the circles, and let OC be joined and produced to A. Draw DH parallel to AO meeting OF in H.

Then, since OH = CD = CA,
and OF = OA,
we have, by subtraction, HF = CO = DH.
Therefore ∠HDF = ∠HFD.

Thus both the triangles CAD, HDF are isosceles, and the third angles ACD, DHF in each are equal. Therefore the equal angles in each are equal to one another, and
∠ADC = ∠DFH.

Add to each the angle CDF, and it follows that
∠ADC + ∠CDF = ∠CDF + ∠DFH
= (two right angles).

Hence ADF is a straight line.

The same proof applies if the circles touch externally.

## Proposition 2

Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and let the tangents to it at B and at any other point D on it meet in T. If now DE be drawn perpendicular to AB, and if AT, DE meet in F,
DF = FE.

Produce AD to meet BT produced in H. Then the angle ADB in the semicircle is right; therefore the angle BDH is also right. And TB, TD are equal.

Therefore T is the centre of the semicircle on BH as diameter, which passes through D.

Hence HT = TB.

And, since DE, HB are parallel, it follows that DF = FE.

## Proposition 3

Let P be any point on a segment of a circle whose base is AB, and let PN be perpendicular to AB. Take D on AB so that AN = ND. If now PQ be an arc equal to the arc PA, and BQ be joined,
BQ, BD shall be equal.

Join PA, PQ, PD, DQ.

Then, since the arcs PA, PQ are equal,
PA = PQ.

But, since AN = ND, and the angles at N are right,
PA = PD.

Therefore PQ = PD,
and ∠PQD = ∠PDQ.

Now, since A, P, Q, B are concyclic,
∠PAD + ∠PQB = (two right angles),
whence ∠PDA + ∠PQB = (two right angles)
= ∠PDA + ∠PDB.

Therefore ∠PQB = ∠PDB;
and, since the parts, the angles PQD, PDQ, are equal,
∠BQD = ∠BDQ,
and BQ = BD.

## Proposition 4

If AB be the diameter of a semicircle and N any point on AB, and if semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AN, BN as diameters respectively, the figure included between the circumferences of the three semicircles is “what Archimedes called an *arbelos*”;^1 and its area is equal to the circle on PN as diameter, where PN is perpendicular to AB and meets the original semicircle in P.

For
AB² = AN² + NB² + 2AN · NB
= AN² + NB² + 2PN².

But circles (or semicircles) are to one another as the squares of their radii (or diameters).

Hence
(semicircle on AB) = (sum of semicircles on AN, NB)
+ 2 (semicircle on PN).

That is, the circle on PN as diameter is equal to the difference between the semicircle on AB and the sum of the semicircles on AN, NB, i.e. is equal to the area of the *arbelos*.

^1 *arbelos* is literally “a shoemaker’s knife.”

## Proposition 5

Let AB be the diameter of a semicircle, C any point on AB, and CD perpendicular to it, and let semicircles be described within the first semicircle and having AC, CB as diameters. Then, if two circles be drawn touching CD on different sides and each touching two of the semicircles, the circles so drawn will be equal.

Let one of the circles touch CD at E, the semicircle on AB in F, and the semicircle on AC in G.

Draw the diameter EH of the circle, which will accordingly be perpendicular to CD and therefore parallel to AB.

Join FH, HA, and FE, EB. Then, by Prop. 1, FHA, FEB are both straight lines, since EH, AB are parallel.

For the same reason AGE, CGH are straight lines.

Let AF produced meet CD in D, and let AE produced meet the outer semicircle in I. Join BI, ID.

Then, since the angles AFB, ACD are right, the straight lines AD, AB are such that the perpendiculars on each from the extremity of the other meet in the point E. Therefore, by the properties of triangles, AE is perpendicular to the line joining B to D.

But AE is perpendicular to BI.

Therefore BID is a straight line.

Now, since the angles at G, I are right, CH is parallel to BD.

Therefore AB : BC = AD : DH
= AC : HE,
so that AC · CB = AB · HE.

In like manner, if *d* is the diameter of the other circle, we can prove that
AC · CB = AB · *d*.

Therefore *d* = HE, and the circles are equal.

## Proposition 6

Let AB, the diameter of a semicircle, be divided at C so that AC = ⅔ CB [or in any ratio]. Describe semicircles within the first semicircle and on AC, CB as diameters, and suppose a circle drawn touching all three semicircles. If GH be the diameter of this circle, to find the relation between GH and AB.

Let GH be that diameter of the circle which is parallel to AB, and let the circle touch the semicircles on AB, AC, CB in D, E, F respectively.

Join AG, GD and BH, HD. Then, by Prop. 1, AGD, BHD are straight lines.
For a like reason AEH, BFG are straight lines, as also are CEG, CFH.

Let AD meet the semicircle on AC in I, and let BD meet the semicircle on CB in K. Join CI, CK meeting AE, BF respectively in L, M, and let GL, HM produced meet AB in N, P respectively.

Now, in the triangle AGC, the perpendiculars from A, C on the opposite sides meet in L. Therefore, by the properties of triangles, GLN is perpendicular to AC.

Similarly HMP is perpendicular to CB.

Again, since the angles at I, K, D are right, CK is parallel to AD, and CI to BD.

Therefore AC : CB = AL : LH
= AN : NP,
and BC : CA = BM : MG
= BP : PN.

Hence AN : NP = NP : PB,
or AN, NP, PB are in continued proportion.

Now, in the case where AC = ⅔ CB,
AN : NP : PB = 4 : 6 : 9,
whence BP : PN : NA : AB = 4 : 6 : 9 : 19.

Therefore GH = NP = 6/19 AB.

And similarly GH can be found when AC : CB is equal to any other given ratio.

## Proposition 7

If circles be circumscribed about and inscribed in a square, the circumscribed circle is double of the inscribed circle.

For the ratio of the circumscribed to the inscribed circle is equal to that of the square on the diagonal to the square itself, i.e. to the ratio 2:1.

## Proposition 8

If AB be any chord of a circle whose centre is O, and if AB be produced to C so that BC is equal to the radius; if further CO meet the circle in D and be produced to meet the circle a second time in E, the arc AE will be equal to three times the arc BD.

Draw the chord EF parallel to AB, and join OB, OF.

Then, since the angles OEF, OFE are equal,
∠COF = 2 ∠OEF
= 2 ∠BCO, by parallels,
= 2 ∠BOD, since BC = BO.

Therefore
∠BOF = 3∠BOD,
so that the arc BF is equal to three times the arc BD.

Hence the arc AE, which is equal to the arc BF, is equal to three times the arc BD.

## Proposition 9

If in a circle two chords AB, CD which do not pass through the centre intersect at right angles, then
(arc AD) + (arc CB) = (arc AC) + (arc DB).

Let the chords intersect at O, and draw the diameter EF parallel to AB intersecting CD in H. EF will thus bisect CD at right angles in H, and
(arc ED) = (arc EC).

Also EDF, ECF are semicircles, while
(arc ED) = (arc EA) + (arc AD).
Therefore
(sum of arcs CF, EA, AD) = (arc of a semicircle).
And the arcs AE, BF are equal.

Therefore
(arc CE) + (arc AD) = (arc of a semicircle).
Hence the remainder of the circumference, the sum of the arcs AC, DB, is also equal to a semicircle; and the proposition is proved.

## Proposition 10

Suppose that TA, TB are two tangents to a circle, while TC cuts it. Let BD be the chord through B parallel to TC, and let AD meet TC in E. Then, if EH be drawn perpendicular to BD, it will bisect it in H.

Let AB meet TC in F, and join BE.

Now the angle TAB is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, i.e.
∠TAB = ∠ADB
= ∠AET, by parallels.
Hence the triangles EAT, AFT have one angle equal and another (at T) common. They are therefore similar, and
FT : AT = AT : ET.
Therefore ET · TF = TA²
= TB².

It follows that the triangles EBT, BFT are similar.

Therefore ∠TEB = ∠TBF
= ∠TAB.

But the angle TEB is equal to the angle EBD, and the angle TAB was proved equal to the angle EDB.

Therefore ∠EDB = ∠EBD.

And the angles at H are right angles.

It follows that BH = HD.

## Proposition 11

If two chords AB, CD in a circle intersect at right angles in a point O, not being the centre, then
AO² + BO² + CO² + DO² = (diameter)².

Draw the diameter CE, and join AC, CB, AD, BE.

Then the angle CAO is equal to the angle CEB in the same segment, and the angles AOC, EBC are right; therefore the triangles AOC, EBC are similar, and
∠ACO = ∠ECB.

It follows that the subtended arcs, and therefore the chords AD, BE, are equal.

Thus (AO² + DO²) + (BO² + CO²) = AD² + BC²
= BE² + BC²
= CE².

## Proposition 12

If AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and TP, TQ the tangents to it from any point T, and if AQ, BP be joined meeting in R, then TR is perpendicular to AB.

Let TR produced meet AB in M, and join PA, QB.

Since the angle APB is right,
∠PAB + ∠PBA = (a right angle)
= ∠AQB.

Add to each side the angle RBQ, and
∠PAB + ∠QBA = (exterior) ∠PRQ.

But
∠TPR = ∠PAB, and ∠TQR = ∠QBA,
in the alternate segments;
therefore ∠TPR + ∠TQR = ∠PRQ.

It follows from this that
TP = TQ = TR.

[For, if PT be produced to O so that TO = TQ, we have
∠TOQ = ∠TQO.
And, by hypothesis, ∠PRQ = ∠TPR + ∠TQR.
By addition, ∠POQ + ∠PRQ = ∠TPR + ∠OQR.
It follows that, in the quadrilateral OPRQ, the opposite angles are together equal to two right angles. Therefore a circle will go round OPQR, and T is its centre, because TP = TO = TQ. Therefore TR = TP.]

Thus ∠TRP = ∠TPR = ∠PAM.

Adding to each the angle PRM,
∠PAM + ∠PRM = ∠TRP + ∠PRM
= (two right angles).

Therefore ∠APR + ∠AMR = (two right angles),
whence ∠AMR = (a right angle).

## Proposition 13

If a diameter AB of a circle meet any chord CD, not a diameter, in E, and if AM, BN be drawn perpendicular to CD, then
CN = DM.

Let O be the centre of the circle, and OH perpendicular to CD. Join BM, and produce HO to meet BM in K.

Then CH = HD.

And, by parallels, since
BO = OA,
BK = KM.

Therefore NH = HM.

Accordingly CN = DM.

## Proposition 14

Let ACB be a semicircle on AB as diameter, and let AD, BE be equal lengths measured along AB from A, B respectively. On AD, BE as diameters describe semicircles on the side towards C, and on ED as diameter a semicircle on the opposite side. Let the perpendicular to AB through O, the centre of the first semicircle, meet the opposite semicircles in C, F respectively.

Then shall the area of the figure bounded by the circumferences of all the semicircles be equal to the area of the circle on CF as diameter.

By Eucl. ii. 10, since ED is bisected at O and produced to A,
EA² + AD² = 2(EO² + OA²),
and CF = OA + OE = EA.

Therefore
AB² + DE² = 4(EO² + OA²) = 2(CF² + AD²).

But circles (and therefore semicircles) are to one another as the squares on their radii (or diameters).
Therefore
(sum of semicircles on AB, DE)
= (circle on CF) + (sum of semicircles on AD, BE).

Therefore
(area of “salinon”) = (area of circle on CF as diam.).

## Proposition 15

Let AB be the diameter of a circle, AC a side of an inscribed regular pentagon, D the middle point of the arc AC. Join CD and produce it to meet BA produced in E; join AC, DB meeting in F, and draw FM perpendicular to AB. Then
EM = (radius of circle).

Let O be the centre of the circle, and join DA, DM, DO, CB.

Now ∠ABC = ⅕ (right angle),
and ∠ABD = ∠DBC = ⅕ (right angle),
whence ∠AOD = ⅕ (right angle).

Further, the triangles FCB, FMB are equal in all respects.

Therefore, in the triangles DCB, DMB, the sides CB, MB being equal and BD common, while the angles CBD, MBD are equal,
∠BCD = ∠BMD = ⅕ (right angle).

But ∠BCD + ∠BAD = (two right angles).
Also, ∠BAD + ∠DAE = (two right angles).
Therefore, ∠DAE = ∠BCD.
And ∠BMD + ∠DMA = (two right angles).
Since ∠BCD = ∠BMD, it follows that ∠DAE = ∠BMD.
Also, ∠BAD = ∠AMD.

Therefore
AD = MD.

Now, in the triangle DMO,
∠MOD = ⅕ (right angle),
∠DMO = ⅕ (right angle).

Therefore ∠ODM = ⅕ (right angle) = ∠AOD;
whence OM = MD.

Again ∠EDA = (supplement of ∠ADC) = ∠ODM = ⅕ (right angle).

Therefore, in the triangles EDA, ODM,
∠EDA = ∠ODM,
∠EAD = ∠OMD;
and the sides AD, MD are equal.

Hence the triangles are equal in all respects, and
EA = MO.

Therefore EM = AO.

Moreover DE = DO; and it follows that, since DE is equal to the side of an inscribed hexagon, and DC is the side of an inscribed decagon, EC is divided at D in extreme and mean ratio [i.e. EC : ED = ED : DC];
> “and this is proved in the book of the Elements” [Eucl. xiii. 9: “If the side of the hexagon and the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle be put together, the whole straight line is divided in extreme and mean ratio, and the greater segment is the side of the hexagon.”]
