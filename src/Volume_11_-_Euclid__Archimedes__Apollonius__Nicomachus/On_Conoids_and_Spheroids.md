# ON CONOIDS AND SPHEROIDS

## Proposition 1

$(A_{n-1} + A_1)^2 = A_{n-1}^2 + A_1^2 + 2A_{n-1} * A_1$.
And, by addition,
$(n+1)A_n^2 = 2(A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$
$+ 2A_1 * A_{n-1} + 2A_2 * A_{n-2} + \dots + 2A_{n-1} * A_1$.

Therefore, in order to obtain the required result, we have to prove that
$2(A_1 * A_{n-1} + A_2 * A_{n-2} + \dots + A_{n-1} * A_1) +$
$A_1(A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + \dots + A_n)$
$= A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2$. (a)

Now
$2A_2 * A_{n-2} = A_1 * 4A_{n-2}$, because $A_2 = 2A_1$,
$2A_3 * A_{n-3} = A_1 * 6A_{n-3}$, because $A_3 = 3A_1$,
...
$2A_{n-1} * A_1 = A_1 * 2(n-1)A_1$.

It follows that
$2(A_1 * A_{n-1} + A_2 * A_{n-2} + \dots + A_{n-1} * A_1) +$
$A_1(A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n) = A_1(A_n + 3A_{n-1} +$
$5A_{n-2} + \dots + (2n-1)A_1)$.

And this last expression can be proved to be equal to
$A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2$.

For $A_n^2 = A_1(n A_n)$
$= A_1\{A_n + (n-1)A_n\}$
$= A_1\{A_n + 2(A_{n-1} + A_{n-2} + \dots + A_1)\}$;
because $(n-1)A_n = A_{n-1} + A_1$
$+ A_{n-2} + A_2$
$+ \dots$
$+ A_1 + A_{n-1}$.

Similarly $A_{n-1}^2 = A_1 \{ A_{n-1} + 2 (A_{n-2} + A_{n-3} + \dots + A_1) \}$,
$A_2^2 = A_1 (A_2 + 2 A_1)$,
$A_1^2 = A_1 * A_1$;
whence, by addition,
$A_1^2 + A_2^2 + A_3^2 + \dots + A_n^2 = A_1\{A_n + 3A_{n-1} + 5A_{n-2} + \dots + (2n-1)A_1\}$.
Thus the equation marked (a) above is true; and it follows that
$(n+1)A_n^2 + A_1(A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + \dots + A_n) = 3(A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$.

Cor. 1. From this it is evident that
$n * A_n^2 < 3(A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$. (1)

Also $A_n^2 = A_1\{A_n + 2(A_{n-1} + A_{n-2} + \dots + A_1)\}$, as above,
so that $A_n^2 > A_1(A_n + A_{n-1} + \dots + A_1)$,
and therefore
$A_n^2 + A_1(A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n) < 2A_n^2$.
It follows from the proposition that
$n * A_n^2 > 3(A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$. (2)

Cor. 2. All these results will hold if we substitute similar figures for squares on all the lines; for similar figures are in the duplicate ratio of their sides.

## Proposition 2

If $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ be any number of areas such that
$A_1 = ax + x^2$,
$A_2 = a * 2x + (2x)^2$,
$A_3 = a * 3x + (3x)^2$,
...
$A_n = a * nx + (nx)^2$,
then $n * A_n : (A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n) < (a + nx) : (2n+1)/3$,
and $n * A_n : (A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_{n-1}) > (a + nx) : (2n-1)/3$.

For, by the Lemma immediately preceding Prop. 1,
$n * anx < (ax + a * 2x + \dots + a * nx)$,
and $> 2(ax + a * 2x + \dots + a * (n-1)x)$.

Also, by the Lemma preceding this proposition,
$n * (nx)^2 < 3\{x^2 + (2x)^2 + (3x)^2 + \dots + (nx)^2\}$
and $> 3\{x^2 + (2x)^2 + \dots + ((n-1)x)^2\}$.

Hence
$n(a * nx + (nx)^2) < [(ax + x^2) + \{a * 2x + (2x)^2\} + \dots + \{a * nx + (nx)^2\}]$,
and
$> [(ax + x^2) + \{a * 2x + (2x)^2\} + \dots + \{a * (n-1)x + ((n-1)x)^2\}]$,
or $n(a * nx + (nx)^2) < A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n$
and $> A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_{n-1}$.

It follows that
$n * A_n : (A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n) < (a + nx) : (2n+1)/3$,
also $n * A_n : (A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_{n-1}) > (a + nx) : (2n-1)/3$.

## Proposition 3

(1) If $TP, TP'$ be two tangents to any conic meeting in $T$, and if $Qq, Q'q'$ be any two chords parallel respectively to $TP, TP'$ and meeting in $O$, then
$QO * Oq : Q'O * Oq' = TP^2 : TP'^2$.

> "And this is proved in the elements of conics."^1

(2) If $QQ'$ be a chord of a parabola bisected in $V$ by the diameter $PV$, and if $PV$ be of constant length, then the areas of the triangle $PQQ'$ and of the segment $PQQ'$ are both constant whatever be the direction of $QQ'$.

Let $ABB'$ be the particular segment of the parabola whose vertex is $A$, so that $BB'$ is bisected perpendicularly by the axis at the point $H$, where $AH = PV$. Draw $QD$ perpendicular to $PV$.

Let $p_a$ be the parameter of the principal ordinates, and let $p$ be another line of such length that
$QV^2 : QD^2 = p : p_a$;
it will then follow that $p$ is equal to the parameter of the ordinates to the diameter $PV$, i.e. those which are parallel to $QV$.

> "For this is proved in the conics."^1

Thus $QV^2 = p * PV$.
And $BH^2 = p_a * AH$, while $AH = PV$.
Therefore $QV^2 : BH^2 = p : p_a$.
But $QV^2 : QD^2 = p : p_a$;
hence $BH = QD$.
Thus $BH * AH = QD * PV$,
and therefore triangle $ABB' = \text{triangle } PQQ'$;
that is, the area of the triangle $PQQ'$ is constant so long as $PV$ is of constant length.
Hence also the area of the segment $PQQ'$ is constant under the same conditions; for the segment is equal to $2/3 * \text{triangle } PQQ'$. [*Quadrature of the Parabola*, Prop. 17 or 24.]

## Proposition 4

The area of any ellipse is to that of the auxiliary circle as the minor axis to the major.

Let $AA'$ be the major and $BB'$ the minor axis of the ellipse, and let $BB'$ meet the auxiliary circle in $b, b'$.
Suppose $O$ to be such a circle that
(circle $AbA'b'$) : $O = CA : CB$.
Then shall $O$ be equal to the area of the ellipse.

For, if not, $O$ must be either greater or less than the ellipse.

I. If possible, let $O$ be greater than the ellipse.

We can then inscribe in the circle $O$ an equilateral polygon of $4n$ sides such that its area is greater than that of the ellipse, [cf. *On the Sphere and Cylinder*, I. 6.]

Let this be done, and inscribe in the auxiliary circle of the ellipse the polygon $AefbghA' \dots$ similar to that inscribed in $O$. Let the perpendiculars $eM, fN, \dots$ on $AA'$ meet the ellipse in $E, F, \dots$ respectively. Join $AE, EF, FB, \dots$.

Suppose that $P'$ denotes the area of the polygon inscribed in the auxiliary circle, and $P$ that of the polygon inscribed in the ellipse.

Then, since all the lines $eM, fN, \dots$ are cut in the same proportions at $E$,
i.e. $eM : EM = fN : FN = \dots = bC : BC$,
the pairs of triangles, as $eAM, EAM$, and the pairs of trapeziums, as $eMNf, EMNF$, are all in the same ratio to one another as $bC$ to $BC$, or as $CA$ to $CB$.
Therefore, by addition,
$P' : P = CA : CB$.

Now $P' : (\text{polygon inscribed in } O)$
$= (\text{circle } AbA'b') : O$
$= CA : CB$, by hypothesis.

Therefore $P$ is equal to the polygon inscribed in $O$.
But this is impossible, because the latter polygon is by hypothesis greater than the ellipse, and *a fortiori* greater than $P$.

Hence $O$ is not greater than the ellipse.

II. If possible, let $O$ be less than the ellipse.

In this case we inscribe in the ellipse a polygon $P$ with $4n$ equal sides such that $P > O$.

Let the perpendiculars from the angular points on the axis $AA'$ be produced to meet the auxiliary circle, and let the corresponding polygon ($P'$) in the circle be formed.

Inscribe in $O$ a polygon similar to $P'$.

Then $P' : P = CA : CB$
$= (\text{circle } AbA'b') : O$, by hypothesis,
$= P' : (\text{polygon inscribed in } O)$.

Therefore the polygon inscribed in $O$ is equal to the polygon $P$; which is impossible, because $P > O$.

Hence $O$, being neither greater nor less than the ellipse, is equal to it; and the required result follows.

## Proposition 5

If $AA', BB'$ be the major and minor axis of an ellipse respectively, and if $d$ be the diameter of any circle, then
$\{\text{area of ellipse}\} : \{\text{area of circle}\} = AA' * BB' : d^2$.

For
$(\text{area of ellipse}) : (\text{area of auxiliary circle}) = BB' : AA'$ [Prop. 4]
$= AA' * BB' : AA'^2$.

And
$(\text{area of aux. circle}) : (\text{area of circle with diam. } d) = AA'^2 : d^2$.
Therefore the required result follows *ex aequali*.

## Proposition 6

The areas of ellipses are as the rectangles under their axes.

This follows at once from Props. 4, 5.

Cor. The areas of similar ellipses are as the squares of corresponding axes.

## Proposition 7

Given an ellipse with centre $C$, and a line $CO$ drawn perpendicular to its plane, it is possible to find a circular cone with vertex $O$ and such that the given ellipse is a section of it [or, in other words, to find the circular sections of the cone with vertex $O$ passing through the circumference of the ellipse].

Conceive an ellipse with $BB'$ as its minor axis and lying in a plane perpendicular to that of the paper. Let $CO$ be drawn perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse, and let $O$ be the vertex of the required cone. Produce $OB, OC, OB'$, and in the same plane with them draw $BED$ meeting $OC, OB'$ produced in $E, D$ respectively and in such a direction that
$BE * ED : EO^2 = CA^2 : CO^2$,
where $CA$ is half the major axis of the ellipse.

> "And this is possible, since
> $BE * ED : EO^2 > BC * CB' : CO^2$."

[Both the construction and this proposition are assumed as known.]

Now conceive a circle with $BD$ as diameter lying in a plane at right angles to that of the paper, and describe a cone with this circle for its base and with vertex $O$.

We have therefore to prove that the given ellipse is a section of the cone, or, if $P$ be any point on the ellipse, that $P$ lies on the surface of the cone.

Draw $PN$ perpendicular to $BB'$. Join $ON$ and produce it to meet $BD$ in $M$, and let $MQ$ be drawn in the plane of the circle on $BD$ as diameter perpendicular to $BD$ and meeting the circle in $Q$. Also let $FG, HK$ be drawn through $E, M$ respectively parallel to $BB'$.

$QM^2 : HM * MK = BM * MD : HM * MK$
$= BE * ED : FE * EG$
$= (BE * ED : EO^2) * (EO^2 : FE * EG)$
$= (CA^2 : CO^2) (CO^2 : BC * CB')$
$= CA^2 : CB^2$
$= PN^2 : BN * NB'$.

Therefore $QM^2 : PN^2 = HM * MK : BN * NB'$
$= OM^2 : ON^2$;
whence, since $PN, QM$ are parallel, $OPQ$ is a straight line.

But $Q$ is on the circumference of the circle on $BD$ as diameter; therefore $OQ$ is a generator of the cone, and hence $P$ lies on the cone.

Thus the cone passes through all points on the ellipse.

## Proposition 8

Given an ellipse, a plane through one of its axes $AA'$ and perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse, and a line $CO$ drawn from $C$, the centre, in the given plane through $AA'$ but not perpendicular to $AA'$, it is possible to find a cone with vertex $O$ such that the given ellipse is a section of it [or, in other words, to find the circular sections of the cone with vertex $O$ whose surface passes through the circumference of the ellipse].

By hypothesis, $OA, OA'$ are unequal. Produce $OA'$ to $D$ so that $OA = OD$. Join $AD$, and draw $FG$ through $C$ parallel to it.

The given ellipse is to be supposed to lie in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Let $BB'$ be the other axis of the ellipse.

Conceive a plane through $AD$ perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and in it describe either (a), if $CB^2 = FC * CG$, a circle with diameter $AD$, or (b), if not, an ellipse on $AD$ as axis such that, if $d$ be the other axis,
$d^2 : AD^2 = CB^2 : FC * CG$.

Take a cone with vertex $O$ whose surface passes through the circle or ellipse just drawn. This is possible even when the curve is an ellipse, because the line from $O$ to the middle point of $AD$ is perpendicular to the plane of the ellipse, and the construction is effected by means of Prop. 7.

Let $P$ be any point on the given ellipse, and we have only to prove that $P$ lies on the surface of the cone so described.

Draw $PN$ perpendicular to $AA'$. Join $ON$, and produce it to meet $AD$ in $M$. Through $M$ draw $HK$ parallel to $A'A$. Lastly, draw $MQ$ perpendicular to the plane of the paper (and therefore perpendicular to both $HK$ and $AD$) meeting the ellipse or circle about $AD$ (and therefore the surface of the cone) in $Q$.

Then
$QM^2 : HM * MK = \{QM^2 : DM * MA\} * \{DM * MA : HM * MK\}$
$= \{d^2 : AD^2\} * \{FC * CG : A'C * CA\}$
$= \{CB^2 : FC * CG\} * \{FC * CG : A'C * CA\}$
$= CB^2 : CA^2$
$= PN^2 : A'N * NA$.

Therefore, alternately,
$QM^2 : PN^2 = HM * MK : A'N * NA$
$= OM^2 : ON^2$.

Thus, since $PN, QM$ are parallel, $OPQ$ is a straight line; and, $Q$ being on the surface of the cone, it follows that $P$ is also on the surface of the cone.

Similarly all points on the ellipse are also on the cone, and the ellipse is therefore a section of the cone.

## Proposition 9

Given an ellipse, a plane through one of its axes and perpendicular to that of the ellipse, and a straight line $CO$ drawn from the centre $C$ of the ellipse in the given plane through the axis but not perpendicular to that axis, it is possible to find a cylinder with axis $OC$ such that the ellipse is a section of it [or, in other words, to find the circular sections of the cylinder with axis $OC$ whose surface passes through the circumference of the given ellipse].

Let $AA'$ be an axis of the ellipse, and suppose the plane of the ellipse to be perpendicular to that of the paper, so that $OC$ lies in the plane of the paper.

Draw $AD, A'E$ parallel to $CO$, and let $DE$ be the line through $O$ perpendicular to both $AD$ and $A'E$.

We have now three different cases according as the other axis $BB'$ of the ellipse is (1) equal to, (2) greater than, or (3) less than, $DE$.

(1) Suppose $BB' = DE$.

Draw a plane through $DE$ at right angles to $OC$, and in this plane describe a circle on $DE$ as diameter. Through this circle describe a cylinder with axis $OC$.

This cylinder shall be the cylinder required, or its surface shall pass through every point $P$ of the ellipse.

For, if $P$ be any point on the ellipse, draw $PN$ perpendicular to $AA'$; through $N$ draw $NM$ parallel to $CO$ meeting $DE$ in $M$, and through $M$, in the plane of the circle on $DE$ as diameter, draw $MQ$ perpendicular to $DE$, meeting the circle in $Q$.

Then, since $DE = BB'$,
$PN^2 : AN * NA' = DO^2 : AC * CA'$.

And $DM * ME : AN * NA' = DO^2 : AC^2$,
since $AD, NM, CO, A'E$ are parallel.

Therefore $PN^2 = DM * ME$
$= QM^2$,
by the property of the circle.

Hence, since $PN, QM$ are equal as well as parallel, $PQ$ is parallel to $MN$ and therefore to $CO$. It follows that $PQ$ is a generator of the cylinder, whose surface accordingly passes through $P$.

(2) If $BB' > DE$, we take $E'$ on $A'E$ such that $DE' = BB'$ and describe a circle on $DE'$ as diameter in a plane perpendicular to that of the paper; and the rest of the construction and proof is exactly similar to those given for case (1).

(3) Suppose $BB' < DE$.

Take a point $K$ on $CO$ produced such that
$DO^2 - CB^2 = OK^2$.

From $K$ draw $KR$ perpendicular to the plane of the paper and equal to $CB$.
Thus $OR^2 = OK^2 + CB^2 = OD^2$.

In the plane containing $DE, OR$ describe a circle on $DE$ as diameter. Through this circle (which must pass through $R$) draw a cylinder with axis $OC$.
We have then to prove that, if $P$ be any point on the given ellipse, $P$ lies on the cylinder so described.

Draw $PN$ perpendicular to $AA'$, and through $N$ draw $NM$ parallel to $CO$ meeting $DE$ in $M$. In the plane of the circle on $DE$ as diameter draw $MQ$ perpendicular to $DE$ and meeting the circle in $Q$.

Lastly, draw $QH$ perpendicular to $NM$ produced. $QH$ will then be perpendicular to the plane containing $AC, DE$, i.e. the plane of the paper.

Now $QH^2 : QM^2 = KR^2 : OR^2$, by similar triangles.

And $QM^2 : AN * NA' = DM * ME : AN * NA'$
$= OD^2 : CA^2$.

Hence, *ex aequali*, since $OR = OD$,
$QH^2 : AN * NA' = KR^2 : CA^2$
$= CB^2 : CA^2$
$= PN^2 : AN * NA'$.

Thus $QH = PN$. And $QH, PN$ are also parallel. Accordingly $PQ$ is parallel to $MN$, and therefore to $CO$, so that $PQ$ is a generator, and the cylinder passes through $P$.

## Proposition 10

It was proved by the earlier geometers that any two cones have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their bases and of their heights.^1 The same method of proof will show that any segments of cones have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their bases and of their heights.

The proposition that any ‘frustum’ of a cylinder is triple of the conical segment which has the same base as the frustum and equal height is also proved in the same manner as the proposition that the cylinder is triple of the cone which has the same base as the cylinder and equal height.^2

---
^1 This follows from Eucl. XII. 11 and 14 taken together. Cf. *On the Sphere and Cylinder* I, Lemma 1.
^2 This proposition was proved by Eudoxus, as stated in the preface to *On the Sphere and Cylinder* I. Cf. Eucl. XII. 10.

## Proposition 11

(1) If a paraboloid of revolution be cut by a plane through, or parallel to, the axis, the section will be a parabola equal to the original parabola which by its revolution generates the paraboloid. And the axis of the section will be the intersection between the cutting plane and the plane through the axis of the paraboloid at right angles to the cutting plane.

If the paraboloid be cut by a plane at right angles to its axis, the section will be a circle whose centre is on the axis.

(2) If a hyperboloid of revolution be cut by a plane through the axis, parallel to the axis, or through the centre, the section will be a hyperbola, (a) if the section be through the axis, equal, (b) if parallel to the axis, similar, (c) if through the centre, not similar, to the original hyperbola which by its revolution generates the hyperboloid. And the axis of the section will be the intersection of the cutting plane and the plane through the axis of the hyperboloid at right angles to the cutting plane.

Any section of the hyperboloid by a plane at right angles to the axis will be a circle whose centre is on the axis.

(3) If any of the spheroidal figures be cut by a plane through the axis or parallel to the axis, the section will be an ellipse, (a) if the section be through the axis, equal, (b) if parallel to the axis, similar, to the ellipse which by its revolution generates the figure. And the axis of the section will be the intersection of the cutting plane and the plane through the axis of the spheroid at right angles to the cutting plane.

If the section be by a plane at right angles to the axis of the spheroid, it will be a circle whose centre is on the axis.

(4) If any of the said figures be cut by a plane through the axis, and if a perpendicular be drawn to the plane of section from any point on the surface of the figure but not on the section, that perpendicular will fall within the section.

> "And the proofs of all these propositions are evident."

## Proposition 12

If a paraboloid of revolution be cut by a plane neither parallel nor perpendicular to the axis, and if the plane through the axis perpendicular to the cutting plane intersect it in a straight line of which the portion intercepted within the paraboloid is $RR'$, the section of the paraboloid will be an ellipse whose major axis is $RR'$ and whose minor axis is equal to the perpendicular distance between the lines through $R, R'$ parallel to the axis of the paraboloid.

Suppose the cutting plane to be perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the latter be the plane through the axis $ANF$ of the paraboloid which intersects the cutting plane at right angles in $RR'$. Let $RH$ be parallel to the axis of the paraboloid, and $R'H$ perpendicular to $RH$.

Let $Q$ be any point on the section made by the cutting plane, and from $Q$ draw $QM$ perpendicular to $RR'$. $QM$ will therefore be perpendicular to the plane of the paper.

Through $M$ draw $DMFE$ perpendicular to the axis $ANF$ meeting the parabolic section made by the plane of the paper in $D, E$. Then $QM$ is perpendicular to $DE$, and, if a plane be drawn through $DE, QM$, it will be perpendicular to the axis and will cut the paraboloid in a circular section.

Since $Q$ is on this circle,
$QM^2 = DM * ME$.

Again, if $PT$ be that tangent to the parabolic section in the plane of the paper which is parallel to $RR'$, and if the tangent at $A$ meet $PT$ in $O$, then, from the property of the parabola,
$DM * ME : RM * MR' = AO^2 : OP^2$ [Prop. 3 (1)]
$= AO^2 : OT^2$, since $AN = AT$.

Therefore $QM^2 : RM * MR' = AO^2 : OT^2$
$= R'H^2 : RR'^2$,
by similar triangles.

Hence $Q$ lies on an ellipse whose major axis is $RR'$ and whose minor axis is equal to $R'H$.

## Propositions 13, 14

If a hyperboloid of revolution be cut by a plane meeting all the generators of the enveloping cone, or if an ‘oblong’ spheroid be cut by a plane not perpendicular to the axis,^1 and if a plane through the axis intersect the cutting plane at right angles in a straight line on which the hyperboloid or spheroid intercepts a length $RR'$, then the section by the cutting plane will be an ellipse whose major axis is $RR'$.

Suppose the cutting plane to be at right angles to the plane of the paper, and suppose the latter plane to be that through the axis $ANF$ which intersects the cutting plane at right angles in $RR'$. The section of the hyperboloid or spheroid by the plane of the paper is thus a hyperbola or ellipse having $ANF$ for its transverse or major axis.

Take any point on the section made by the cutting plane, as $Q$, and draw $QM$ perpendicular to $RR'$. $QM$ will then be perpendicular to the plane of the paper.

Through $M$ draw $DFE$ at right angles to the axis $ANF$ meeting the hyperbola or ellipse in $D, E$; and through $QM, DE$ let a plane be described. This plane will accordingly be perpendicular to the axis and will cut the hyperboloid or spheroid in a circular section.

Thus $QM^2 = DM * ME$.

Let $PT$ be that tangent to the hyperbola or ellipse which is parallel to $RR'$, and let the tangent at $A$ meet $PT$ in $O$.

Then, by the property of the hyperbola or ellipse,
$DM * ME : RM * MR' = OA^2 : OP^2$,
or $QM^2 : RM * MR' = OA^2 : OP^2$.

Now (1) in the hyperbola $OA < OP$, because $AT < AN$, and accordingly
$OT < OP$, while $OA < OT$,
(2) in the ellipse, if $KK'$ be the diameter parallel to $RR'$, and $BB'$ the minor axis,
$BC * CB' : KC * CK' = OA^2 : OP^2$;
and $BC * CB' < KC * CK'$, so that $OA < OP$.

Hence in both cases the locus of $Q$ is an ellipse whose major axis is $RR'$.

Cor. 1. If the spheroid be a ‘flat’ spheroid, the section will be an ellipse, and everything will proceed as before except that $RR'$ will in this case be the minor axis.

---
^1 Archimedes begins Prop. 14 for the spheroid with the remark that, when the cutting plane passes through or is parallel to the axis, the case is clear. Cf. Prop. 11 (3).

Cor. 2. In all conoids or spheroids parallel sections will be similar, since the ratio $OA^2 : OP^2$ is the same for all the parallel sections.

## Proposition 15

(1) If from any point on the surface of a conoid a line be drawn, in the case of the paraboloid, parallel to the axis, and, in the case of the hyperboloid, parallel to any line passing through the vertex of the enveloping cone, the part of the straight line which is in the same direction as the convexity of the surface will fall without it, and the part which is in the other direction within it.

For, if a plane be drawn, in the case of the paraboloid, through the axis and the point, and, in the case of the hyperboloid, through the given point and through the given straight line drawn through the vertex of the enveloping cone, the section by the plane will be (a) in the paraboloid a parabola whose axis is the axis of the paraboloid, (b) in the hyperboloid a hyperbola in which the given line through the vertex of the enveloping cone is a diameter.^1

[Prop. 11]

Hence the property follows from the plane properties of the conics.

(2) If a plane touch a conoid without cutting it, it will touch it at one point only, and the plane drawn through the point of contact and the axis of the conoid will be at right angles to the plane which touches it.

For, if possible, let the plane touch at two points. Draw through each point a parallel to the axis. The plane passing through both parallels will therefore either pass through, or be parallel to, the axis. Hence the section of the conoid made by this plane will be a conic [Prop. 11 (1), (2)], the two points will lie on this conic, and the line joining them will lie within the conic and therefore within the conoid. But this line will be in the tangent plane, since the two points are in it. Therefore some portion of the tangent plane will be within the conoid; which is impossible, since the plane does not cut it.

Therefore the tangent plane touches in one point only.

That the plane through the point of contact and the axis is perpendicular to the tangent plane is evident in the particular case where the point of contact is the vertex of the conoid. For, if two planes through the axis cut it in two conics, the tangents at the vertex in both conics will be perpendicular to the axis of the conoid. And all such tangents will be in the tangent plane, which must therefore be perpendicular to the axis and to any plane through the axis.

If the point of contact $P$ is not the vertex, draw the plane passing through the axis $AN$ and the point $P$. It will cut the conoid in a conic whose axis is $AN$ and the tangent plane in a line $DPE$ touching the conic at $P$. Draw $PNP'$ perpendicular to the axis, and draw a plane through it also perpendicular to the axis. This plane will make a circular section and meet the tangent plane in a tangent to the circle, which will therefore be at right angles to $PN$. Hence the tangent to the circle will be at right angles to the plane containing $PN, AN$; and it follows that this last plane is perpendicular to the tangent plane.

^1 There seems to be some error in the text here, which says that “the diameter” (i.e. axis) of the hyperbola is “the straight line drawn in the conoid from the vertex of the cone.” But this straight line is not, in general, the axis of the section.

## Proposition 16

(1) If a plane touch any of the spheroidal figures without cutting it, it will touch at one point only, and the plane through the point of contact and the axis will be at right angles to the tangent plane.

This is proved by the same method as the last proposition.

(2) If any conoid or spheroid be cut by a plane through the axis, and if through any tangent to the resulting conic a plane be erected at right angles to the plane of section, the plane so erected will touch the conoid or spheroid in the same point as that in which the line touches the conic.

For it cannot meet the surface at any other point. If it did, the perpendicular from the second point on the cutting plane would be perpendicular also to the tangent to the conic and would therefore fall outside the surface. But it must fall within it. [Prop. 11 (4)]

(3) If two parallel planes touch any of the spheroidal figures, the line joining the points of contact will pass through the centre of the spheroid.

If the planes are at right angles to the axis, the proposition is obvious. If not, the plane through the axis and one point of contact is at right angles to the tangent plane at that point. It is therefore at right angles to the parallel tangent plane, and therefore passes through the second point of contact. Hence both points of contact lie on one plane through the axis, and the proposition is reduced to a plane one.

## Proposition 17

If two parallel planes touch any of the spheroidal figures, and another plane be drawn parallel to the tangent planes and passing through the centre, the line drawn through any point of the circumference of the resulting section parallel to the chord of contact of the tangent planes will fall outside the spheroid.

This is proved at once by reduction to a plane proposition.

Archimedes adds that it is evident that, if the plane parallel to the tangent planes does not pass through the centre, a straight line drawn in the manner

described will fall without the spheroid in the direction of the smaller segment but within it in the other direction.

### Proposition 18

Any spheroidal figure which is cut by a plane through the centre is divided, both as regards its surface and its volume, into two equal parts by that plane.

To prove this, Archimedes takes another equal and similar spheroid, divides it similarly by a plane through the centre, and then uses the method of application.

### Propositions 19, 20

Given a segment cut off by a plane from a paraboloid or hyperboloid of revolution, or a segment of a spheroid less than half the spheroid also cut off by a plane, it is possible to inscribe in the segment one solid figure and to circumscribe about it another solid figure, each made up of cylinders or “frusta” of cylinders of equal height, and such that the circumscribed figure exceeds the inscribed figure by a volume less than that of any given solid.

Let the plane base of the segment be perpendicular to the plane of the paper,

## ON CONOIDS AND SPHEROIDS

and let the plane of the paper be the plane through the axis of the conoid or spheroid which cuts the base of the segment at right angles in *BC*. The section in the plane of the paper is then a conic *BAC*. [Prop. 11]

Let *EAF* be that tangent to the conic which is parallel to *BC*, and let *A* be the point of contact. Through *EAF* draw a plane parallel to the plane through *BC* bounding the segment. The plane so drawn will then touch the conoid or spheroid at *A*. [Prop. 16]

(1) If the base of the segment is at right angles to the axis of the conoid or spheroid, *A* will be the vertex of the conoid or spheroid, and its axis *AD* will bisect *BC* at right angles.

(2) If the base of the segment is not at right angles to the axis of the conoid or spheroid, we draw *AD*
(a) in the paraboloid, parallel to the axis,
(b) in the hyperboloid, through the centre (or the vertex of the enveloping cone),
(c) in the spheroid, through the centre,
and in all the cases it will follow that *AD* bisects *BC* in *D*.

Then *A* will be the vertex of the segment, and *AD* will be its axis.

Further, the base of the segment will be a circle or an ellipse with *BC* as diameter or as an axis respectively, and with centre *D*. We can therefore describe through this circle or ellipse a cylinder or a 'frustum' of a cylinder [Prop. 9]

Dividing this cylinder or frustum continually into equal parts by planes parallel to the base, we shall at length arrive at a cylinder or frustum less in volume than any given solid.

Let this cylinder or frustum be that whose axis is *OD*, and let *AD* be divided into parts equal to *OD*, at *L, M, ...*. Through *L, M, ...* draw lines parallel to *BC* meeting the conic in *P, Q, ...*, and through these lines draw planes parallel to the base of the segment. These will cut the conoid or spheroid in circles or similar ellipses. On each of these circles or ellipses describe two cylinders or frusta of cylinders each with axis equal to *OD*, one of them lying in the direction of *A* and the other in the direction of *D*, as shown in the figure.

Then the cylinders or frusta of cylinders drawn in the direction of *A* make up a circumscribed figure, and those in the direction of *D* an inscribed figure, in relation to the segment.

Also the cylinder or frustum *PG* in the circumscribed figure is equal to the cylinder or frustum *PH* in the inscribed figure, *QI* in the circumscribed figure is equal to *QK* in the inscribed figure, and so on.

Therefore, by addition,
(circumscribed fig.) = (inscr. fig.) + (cylinder or frustum whose axis is *OD*).

But the cylinder or frustum whose axis is *OD* is less than the given solid figure; whence the proposition follows.

> "Having set out these preliminary propositions, let us proceed to demonstrate the theorems propounded with reference to the figures."

### Propositions 21, 22

Any segment of a paraboloid of revolution is *half as large again* as the cone or segment of a cone which has the same base and the same axis.

Let the base of the segment be perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the plane of the paper be the plane through the axis of the paraboloid which cuts the base of the segment at right angles in *BC* and makes the parabolic section *BAC*.

Let *EF* be that tangent to the parabola which is parallel to *BC*, and let *A* be the point of contact.

Then (1), if the plane of the base of the segment is perpendicular to the axis of the paraboloid, that axis is the line *AD* bisecting *BC* at right angles in *D*.

(2) If the plane of the base is not perpendicular to the axis of the paraboloid, draw *AD* parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. *AD* will then bisect *BC*, but not at right angles.

Draw through *EF* a plane parallel to the base of the segment. This will touch the paraboloid at *A*, and *A* will be the vertex of the segment, *AD* its axis.

The base of the segment will be a circle with diameter *BC* or an ellipse with *BC* as major axis.

Accordingly a cylinder or a frustum of a cylinder can be found passing through the circle or ellipse and having *AD* for its axis [Prop. 9]; and likewise a cone or a segment of a cone can be drawn passing through the circle or ellipse and having *A* for vertex and *AD* for axis. [Prop. 8]

Suppose *X* to be a cone equal to 3/2 (cone or segment of cone *ABC*). The cone *X* is therefore equal to half the cylinder or frustum of a cylinder *EC*. [Cf. Prop. 10]

We shall prove that the volume of the segment of the paraboloid is equal to *X*.

If not, the segment must be either greater or less than *X*.

I. If possible, let the segment be greater than *X*.

We can then inscribe and circumscribe, as in the last proposition, figures made up of cylinders or frusta of cylinders with equal height and such that
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscribed fig.) < (segment) — *X*.

Let the greatest of the cylinders or frusta forming the circumscribed figure be that whose base is the circle or ellipse about *BC* and whose axis is *OD*, and let the smallest of them be that whose base is the circle or ellipse about *PP'* and whose axis is *AL*.

Let the greatest of the cylinders forming the inscribed figure be that whose base is the circle or ellipse about *RR'* and whose axis is *OD*, and let the smallest be that whose base is the circle or ellipse about *PP'* and whose axis is *LM*.

Produce all the plane bases of the cylinders or frusta to meet the surface of the complete cylinder or frustum *EC*.

Now, since
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscr. fig.) < (segment) — *X*,
it follows that
(inscribed figure) > *X*. (α)

Next, comparing successively the cylinders or frusta with heights equal to *OD* and respectively forming parts of the complete cylinder or frustum *EC* and of the inscribed figure, we have
(first cylinder or frustum in *EC*) : (first in inscr. fig.)
= *BD*^2 : *RO*^2
= *AD* : *AO*
= *BD* : *TO*, where *AB* meets *OR* in *T*.

And (second cylinder or frustum in *EC*) : (second in inscr. fig.)
= *HO* : *SN*, in like manner,
and so on.

Hence [Prop. 1]
(cylinder or frustum *EC*) : (inscribed figure)
= (*BD*+*HO*+ ...) : (*TO*+*SN*+ ...),
where *BD*, *HO*, ... are all equal, and *BD*, *TO*, *SN*, ... diminish in arithmetical progression.

But [Lemma preceding Prop. 1]
*BD*+*HO*+ ... > 2 (*TO*+*SN*+ ...).

Therefore
(cylinder or frustum *EC*) > 2 (inscribed fig.),
or *X* > (inscribed fig.) ;
which is impossible, by (α) above.

II. If possible, let the segment be less than *X*.

In this case we inscribe and circumscribe figures as before, but such that
(circumscr. fig.) — (inscr. fig.) < *X* — (segment),
whence it follows that
(circumscribed figure) < *X*. (β)

And, comparing the cylinders or frusta making up the complete cylinder or frustum *CE* and the circumscribed figure respectively, we have
(first cylinder or frustum in *CE*) : (first in circumscr. fig.)
= *BD*^2 : *BD*^2
= *BD* : *BD*.

(second in *CE*) : (second in circumscr. fig.)
= *HO*^2 : *RO*^2
= *AD* : *AO*
= *HO* : *TO*,
and so on.

Hence [Prop. 1]
(cylinder or frustum *CE*) : (circumscribed fig.)
= (*BD*+*HO*+ ...) : (*BD*+*TO*+ ...),
< 2 : 1, [Lemma preceding Prop. 1]
and it follows that
*X* < (circumscribed fig.) ;
which is impossible, by (β).

Thus the segment, being neither greater nor less than *X*, is equal to it, and therefore to 3/2 (cone or segment of cone *ABC*).

### Proposition 23

If from a paraboloid of revolution two segments be cut off, one by a plane perpendicular to the axis, the other by a plane not perpendicular to the axis, and if the axes of the segments are equal, the segments will be equal in volume.

Let the two planes be supposed perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the latter plane be the plane through the axis of the paraboloid cutting the other two planes at right angles in *BB'*, *QQ'* respectively and the paraboloid itself in the parabola *QPQ'B'*.

Let *AN*, *PV* be the equal axes of the segments, and *A*, *P* their respective vertices.

Draw *QL* parallel to *AN* or *PV* and *Q'L* perpendicular to *QL*.

Now, since the segments of the parabolic section cut off by *BB'*, *QQ'* have equal axes, the triangles *ABB'*, *PQQ'* are equal [Prop. 3]. Also, if *QD* be perpendicular to *PV*, *QD* = *BN* (as in the same Prop. 3).

Conceive two cones drawn with the same bases as the segments and with *A*, *P* as vertices respectively. The height of the cone *PQQ'* is then *PK*, where *PK* is perpendicular to *QQ'*.

Now the cones are in the ratio compounded of the ratios of their bases and of their heights, i.e. the ratio compounded of (1) the ratio of the circle about *BB'* to the ellipse about *QQ'*, and (2) the ratio of *AN* to *PK*. That is to say, we have, by means of Props. 5, 12,
(cone *ABB'*) : (cone *PQQ'*) = (*BB'*^2 : *QQ'* * *Q'L*) * (*AN* : *PK*).

And *BB'* = 2 *BN* = 2 *QD* = *Q'L*, while *QQ'* = 2*QV*.

Therefore
(cone *ABB'*) : (cone *PQQ'*) = (*QD* : *QV*) * (*AN* : *PK*)
= (*PK* : *PV*) * (*AN* : *PK*)
= *AN* : *PV*.

Since *AN* = *PV*, the ratio of the cones is a ratio of equality; and it follows that the segments, being each *half as large again* as the respective cones [Prop. 22], are equal.

### Proposition 24

If from a paraboloid of revolution two segments be cut off by planes drawn in any manner, the segments will be to one another as the squares on their axes.

For let the paraboloid be cut by a plane through the axis in the parabolic section *P'PApp'*, and let the axis of the parabola and paraboloid be *ANN'*.

Measure along *ANN'* the lengths *AN*, *AN'* equal to the respective axes of the given segments, and through *N*, *N'* draw planes perpendicular to the axis, making circular sections on *Pp*, *P'p'* as diameters respectively. With these circles as bases and with the common vertex *A* let two cones be described.

Now the segments of the paraboloid whose bases are the circles about *Pp*, *P'p'* are equal to the given segments respectively, since their respective axes are equal [Prop. 23]; and, since the segments *APp*, *AP'p'* are *half as large again* as the cones *APp*, *AP'p'* respectively, we have only to show that the cones are in the ratio of *AN*^2 to *AN'*^2.

But
(cone *APp*) : (cone *AP'p'*) = (*PN*^2 : *P'N'*^2) * (*AN* : *AN'*)
= (*AN* : *AN'*) * (*AN* : *AN'*)
= *AN*^2 : *AN'*^2;
thus the proposition is proved.

### Propositions 25, 26

In any hyperboloid of revolution, if *A* be the vertex and *AD* the axis of any segment cut off by a plane, and if *CA* be the semidiameter of the hyperboloid through *A* (*CA* being of course in the same straight line with *AD*), then
(segment) : (cone with same base and axis)
= (*AD*+3*CA*) : (*AD*+2*CA*).

Let the plane cutting off the segment be perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the latter plane be the plane through the axis of the hyperboloid which intersects the cutting plane at right angles in *BB'*, and makes the hyperbolic segment *BAB'*. Let *C* be the centre of the hyperboloid (or the vertex of the enveloping cone).

Let *EF* be that tangent to the hyperbolic section which is parallel to *BB'*. Let *EF* touch at *A*, and join *CA*. Then *CA* produced will bisect *BB'* at *D*, *CA* will be a semi-diameter of the hyperboloid, *A* will be the vertex of the segment, and *AD* its axis. Produce *AC* to *A'* and *H*, so that *AC* = *CA'* = *A'H*.

Through *EF* draw a plane parallel to the base of the segment. This plane will touch the hyperboloid at *A*.

Then (1), if the base of the segment is at right angles to the axis of the hyperboloid, *A* will be the vertex, and *AD* the axis, of the hyperboloid as well as of the segment, and the base of the segment will be a circle on *BB'* as diameter.

(2) If the base of the segment is not perpendicular to the axis of the hyperboloid, the base will be an ellipse on *BB'* as major axis. [Prop. 13]

Then we can draw a cylinder or a frustum of a cylinder *EBB'F* passing through the circle or ellipse about *BB'* and having *AD* for its axis; also we can describe a cone or a segment of a cone through the circle or ellipse and having *A* for its vertex.

We have to prove that
(segment *ABB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = *HD* : *A'D*.

Let *V* be a cone such that
*V* : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = *HD* : *A'D*, (α)
and we have to prove that *V* is equal to the segment.

Now
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = 3 : 1.

Therefore, by means of (α),
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V* = 3*A'D* : *HD*. (β)

If the segment is not equal to *V*, it must either be greater or less.

I. If possible, let the segment be greater than *V*.

Inscribe and circumscribe to the segment figures made up of cylinders or frusta of cylinders, with axes along *AD* and all equal to one another, such that
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscr. fig.) < (segment) — *V*,
whence
(inscribed figure) > *V*. (γ)

Produce all the planes forming the bases of the cylinders or frusta of cylinders to meet the surface of the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'*.

Then, if *ND* be the axis of the greatest cylinder or frustum in the circumscribed figure, the complete cylinder will be divided into cylinders or frusta each equal to this greatest cylinder or frustum.

Let there be a number of straight lines *a* equal to *AA'* and as many in number as the parts into which *AD* is divided by the bases of the cylinders or frusta. To each line *a* apply a rectangle which shall overlap it by a square, and let the greatest of the rectangles be equal to the rectangle *AD* * *A'D* and the least equal to the rectangle *AL* * *A'L*; also let the sides of the overlapping squares *b, p, q, ... l* be in descending arithmetical progression. Thus *b, p, q, ... l* will be respectively equal to *AD, AN, AM, ... AL*, and the rectangles (*ab*+*b*^2), (*ap*+*p*^2), ... (*al*+*l*^2) will be respectively equal to *AD* * *A'D*, *AN* * *A'N*, ... *AL* * *A'L*.

Suppose, further, that we have a series of spaces *S* each equal to the largest rectangle *AD* * *A'D* and as many in number as the diminishing rectangles.

Comparing now the successive cylinders or frusta (1) in the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'* and (2) in the inscribed figure, beginning from the base of the segment, we have
(first cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (first in inscr. figure)
= *BD*^2 : *PX*^2
= *AD* * *A'D* : *AN* * *A'N*, from the hyperbola,
= *S* : (*ap*+*p*^2).

Again
(second cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (second in inscr. fig.)
= *BD*^2 : *QM*^2
= *AD* * *A'D* : *AM* * *A'M*
= *S* : (*aq*+*q*^2),
and so on.

The last cylinder or frustum in the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'* has no cylinder or frustum corresponding to it in the inscribed figure.

Combining the proportions, we have [Prop. 1]
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : (inscribed figure)
= (sum of all the spaces *S*) : ((*ap*+*p*^2) + (*aq*+*q*^2) + ...)
> (*3CA* + *AD*) : (*CA* + *AD*) [Prop. 2]
> (cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V*, by (β) above.

Hence (inscribed figure) < *V*.

But this is impossible, because, by (γ) above, the inscribed figure is greater than *V*.

II. Next suppose, if possible, that the segment is less than *V*.

In this case we circumscribe and inscribe figures such that
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscribed fig.) < *V* — (segment),
whence we derive
*V* > (circumscribed figure). (δ)

We now compare successive cylinders or frusta in the complete cylinder or frustum and in the circumscribed figure; and we have
(first cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (first in circumscribed fig.)
= *S* : *S*
= *S* : (*ab*+*b*^2),

(second in *EB'*) : (second in circumscribed fig.)
= *S* : (*ap*+*p*^2),
and so on.

Hence [Prop. 1]
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : (circumscribed fig.)
= (sum of all spaces *S*) : ((*ab*+*b*^2) + (*ap*+*p*^2)+ ...)
< (*3CA* + *AD*) : (*CA* + *AD*) [Prop. 2]
< (cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V*, by (β) above.

Hence the circumscribed figure is greater than *V*; which is impossible, by (δ) above.

Thus the segment is neither greater nor less than *V*, and is therefore equal to it.

Therefore, by (α),
(segment *ABB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*)
= (*AD*+3*CA*) : (*AD*+2*CA*).

### Propositions 27, 28, 29, 30

(1) In any spheroid whose centre is *C*, if a plane meeting the axis cut off a segment not greater than half the spheroid and having *A* for its vertex and *AD* for its axis, and if *A'D* be the axis of the remaining segment of the spheroid, then
(first segment) : (cone or segment of cone with same base and axis)
= (*CA*+*A'D*) : *A'D*
[ = *2CA-AD* : *CA-AD*].

(2) As a particular case, if the plane passes through the centre, so that the segment is half the spheroid, half the spheroid is double of the cone or segment of a cone which has the same vertex and axis.

Let the plane cutting off the segment be at right angles to the plane of the paper, and let the latter plane be the plane through the axis of the spheroid which intersects the cutting plane in *BB'* and makes the elliptic section *ABA'B'*.

Let *EF*, *E'F'* be the two tangents to the ellipse which are parallel to *BB'*, let them touch it in *A, A'*, and through the tangents draw planes parallel to the base of the segment. These planes will touch the spheroid at *A, A'*, which will be the vertices of the two segments into which it is divided. Also *AA'* will pass through the centre *C* and bisect *BB'* in *D*.

Then (1) if the base of the segments be perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid, *A, A'* will be the vertices of the spheroid as well as of the segments, *AA'* will be the axis of the spheroid, and the base of the segments will be a circle on *BB'* as diameter;

(2) if the base of the segments be not perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid, the base of the segments will be an ellipse of which *BB'* is one axis, and *AD, A'D* will be the axes of the segments respectively.

We can now draw a cylinder or a frustum of a cylinder *EBB'F* through the circle or ellipse about *BB'* and having *AD* for its axis; and we can also draw a cone or a segment of a cone passing through the circle or ellipse about *BB'* and having *A* for its vertex.

We have then to show that, if *CA'* be produced to *H* so that *CA'* = *A'H*,
(segment *ABB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = *HD* : *A'D*.

Let *V* be such a cone that
*V* : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = *HD* : *A'D*, (α)
and we have to show that the segment *ABB'* is equal to *V*.

But, since
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = 3 : 1,
we have, by the aid of (α),
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V* = 3*A'D* : *HD*. (β)

Now, if the segment *ABB'* is not equal to *V*, it must be either greater or less.

I. Suppose, if possible, that the segment is greater than *V*.

Let figures be inscribed and circumscribed to the segment consisting of cylinders or frusta of cylinders, with axes along *AD* and all equal to one another, such that
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscribed fig.) < (segment) — *V*,
whence it follows that
(inscribed fig.) > *V*. (γ)

Produce all the planes forming the bases of the cylinders or frusta to meet the surface of the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'*. Thus, if *ND* be the axis of the greatest cylinder or frustum of a cylinder in the circumscribed figure, the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'* will be divided into cylinders or frusta of cylinders each equal to the greatest of those in the circumscribed figure.

Take straight lines *da'* each equal to *A'D* and as many in number as the parts into which *AD* is divided by the bases of the cylinders or frusta, and measure *da* along *da'* equal to *AD*. It follows that *aa'* = 2*CD*.

Apply to each of the lines *a'd* rectangles with height equal to *ad*, and draw the squares on each of the lines *ad* as in the figure. Let *S* denote the area of each complete rectangle.

From the first rectangle take away a gnomon with breadth equal to *AN* (i.e. with each end of a length equal to *AN*); take away from the second rectangle a gnomon with breadth equal to *AM*, and so on, the last rectangle having no gnomon taken from it.

Then
the first gnomon = *AN* * *A'N*.

Similarly,
the second gnomon = *AM* * *A'M*,
and so on.

And the last gnomon (that in the last rectangle but one) is equal to *AL* * *A'L*.

Also, after the gnomons are taken away from the successive rectangles, the remainders (which we will call *R1, R2, ... Rn*, where *n* is the number of rectangles and accordingly *Rn* = *S*) are rectangles applied to straight lines each of length *aa'* and “exceeding by squares” whose sides are respectively equal to *DN, DM, ... DA*.

For brevity, let *DN* be denoted by *x*, and *aa'* or 2*CD* by *c*, so that
*R1* = *cx*+*x*^2,
*R2* = *c* * 2*x*+(2*x*)^2,
...
where *b* = *nx* = *AD*.

Then, comparing successively the cylinders or frusta of cylinders (1) in the complete cylinder or frustum *EB'* and (2) in the inscribed figure, we have
(first cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (first in inscribed fig.)
= *BD*^2 : *PN*^2
= *AD* * *A'D* : *AN* * *A'N*
= *S* : (first gnomon) ;

(second cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (second in inscribed fig.)
= *S* : (second gnomon),
and so on.

The last of the cylinders or frusta in the cylinder or frustum *EB'* has none corresponding to it in the inscribed figure, and there is no corresponding gnomon.

Combining the proportions, we have [by Prop. 1]
(cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : (inscribed fig.)
= (sum of all spaces *S*) : (sum of gnomons).

Now the differences between *S* and the successive gnomons are *R1, R2, ... Rn*, while
*R1* = *cx*+*x*^2,
*R2* = *c* * 2*x*+(2*x*)^2,
...
*Rn* = *cb* + *b*^2 = *S*.

Hence [Prop. 2]
(sum of all spaces *S*) : (sum of gnomons)
> (*3CA* - *AD*) : (*CA* - *AD*)
> (cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V*, from (β) above.

Therefore (inscribed fig.) < *V* ;
which is impossible, by (γ) above.

Hence the segment *ABB'* is not greater than *V*.

II. If possible, let the segment *ABB'* be less than *V*.

We then inscribe and circumscribe figures such that
(circumscribed fig.) — (inscribed fig.) < *V* — (segment),
whence
*V* > (circumscribed figure). (δ)

In this case we compare the cylinders or frusta in (*EB'*) with those in the circumscribed figure.

Thus
(first cylinder or frustum in *EB'*) : (first in circumscribed fig.)
= *S* : *S* ;

(second in *EB'*) : (second in circumscribed fig.)
= *S* : (first gnomon),
and so on.
Lastly
(last in *EB'*) : (last in circumscribed fig.)
= *S* : (last gnomon).

Now
(sum of all spaces *S*) : (sum of gnomons)
< (*3CA* - *AD*) : (*CA* - *AD*) [Prop. 2]
< (cylinder or frustum *EB'*) : *V*, by (β) above.

Hence the circumscribed figure is greater than *V*; which is impossible, by (δ) above.

Thus, since the segment *ABB'* is neither greater nor less than *V*, it is equal to it; and the proposition is proved.

(2) The particular case [Props. 27, 28] where the segment is half the spheroid differs from the above in that the distance *CD* or *c*/2 vanishes, and the rectangles *cb*+*b*^2 are simply squares (*b*^2), so that the gnomons are simply the differences between *b*^2 and *x*^2, *b*^2 and (2*x*)^2, and so on.

Instead therefore of Prop. 2 we use the Lemma to Prop. 2, Cor. 1, given above [*On Spirals*, Prop. 10], and instead of the ratio (*c*+*b*) : (*b*/3) we obtain the ratio 3 : 2, whence (segment *ABB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) = 2 : 1.

### Propositions 31, 32

If a plane divide a spheroid into two unequal segments, and if *AN*, *A'N* be the axes of the lesser and greater segments respectively, while *C* is the centre of the spheroid, then
(greater segment) : (cone or segment of cone with same base and axis)
= (*CA*+*AN*) : *AN*.

Let the plane dividing the spheroid be that through *PP'* perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the latter plane be that through the axis of the spheroid which intersects the cutting plane in *PP'* and makes the elliptic section *PAP'A'*.

Draw the tangents to the ellipse which are parallel to *PP'*; let them touch the ellipse at *A, A'*, and through the tangents draw planes parallel to the base of the segments. These planes will touch the spheroid at *A, A'*, the line *AA'* will pass through the centre *C* and bisect *PP'* in *N*, while *AN, A'N* will be the axes of the segments.

Then (1) if the cutting plane be perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid, *AA'* will be that axis, and *A, A'* will be the vertices of the spheroid as well as of the segments. Also the sections of the spheroid by the cutting plane and all planes parallel to it will be circles.

(2) If the cutting plane be not perpendicular to the axis, the base of the segments will be an ellipse of which *PP'* is an axis, and the sections of the spheroid by all planes parallel to the cutting plane will be similar ellipses.

Draw a plane through *C* parallel to the base of the segments and meeting the plane of the paper in *BB'*.

Construct three cones or segments of cones, two having *A* for their common vertex and the plane sections through *PP'*, *BB'* for their respective bases, and a third having the plane section through *PP'* for its base and *A'* for its vertex.

Produce *CA* to *H* and *CA'* to *H'* so that
*AH* = *A'H* = *CA*.

We have then to prove that
(segment *A'PP'*) : (cone or segment of cone *A'PP'*)
= (*CA*+*AN*) : *AN*
= *NH* : *AN*.

Now half the spheroid is double of the cone or segment of a cone *ABB'* [Props. 27, 28]. Therefore
(the spheroid) = 4 (cone or segment of cone *ABB'*).

But
(cone or segment of cone *ABB'*) : (cone or segment of cone *APP'*)
= (*CA* : *AN*) * (*PC*^2 : *PN*^2)
= (*CA* : *AN*) * (*CA* * *CA'* : *AN* * *A'N*). (α)

If we measure *AK* along *AA'* so that
*AK* * *AC* = *AC* * *AN*
we have *AK* * *A'N* : *AC* * *A'N* = *CA* * *AN*,
and the compound ratio in (α) becomes
(*AK* * *A'N* : *CA* * *A'N*) * (*CA* * *CA'* : *AN* * *A'N*),
i.e. *AK* * *CA'* : *AN* * *A'N*.

# ON CONOIDS AND SPHEROIDS

Thus

(cone or segment of cone $ABB'$) : (cone or segment of cone $APP'$)
$= AK \cdot CA' : AN \cdot A'N$.

But (cone or segment of cone $APP'$) : (segment $APP'$)
$= A'N : NH'$ [Props. 29, 30]
$= AN \cdot A'N : AN \cdot NH'$.

Therefore, *ex aequali*,

(cone or segment of cone $ABB'$) : (segment $APP'$)
$= AK \cdot CA' : AN \cdot NH'$,

so that (spheroid) : (segment $APP'$)
$= HH' \cdot AK : AN \cdot NH'$,
since $HH' = 2CA'$.

Hence (segment $A'PP'$) : (segment $APP'$)
$= (HH' \cdot AK - AN \cdot NH') : AN \cdot NH'$
$= (AK \cdot NH + NH' \cdot NK) : AN \cdot NH'$.

Further,

(segment $APP'$) : (cone or segment of cone $APP'$)
$= NH' : A'N$
$= AN \cdot NH' : AN \cdot A'N$,

and

(cone or segment of cone $APP'$) : (cone or segment of cone $A'PP'$)
$= AN : A'N$
$= AN \cdot A'N : A'N^2$.

From the last three proportions we obtain, *ex aequali*,

(segment $A'PP'$) : (cone or segment of cone $A'PP'$)
$= (AK \cdot NH + NH' \cdot NK) : A'N^2$
$= (AK \cdot NH + NH' \cdot NK) : (CA^2 + NH' \cdot CN)$
$= (AK \cdot NH + NH' \cdot NK) : (AK \cdot AN + NH' \cdot CN)$.

But

$AK \cdot NH : AK \cdot AN = NH : AN$
$= CA + AN : AN$
$= AK + CA : CA$ (since $AK : AC = AC : AN$)
$= HK : CA$
$= HK - NH : CA - AN$
$= NK : CN$
$= NH' \cdot NK : NH' \cdot CN$.

Hence the ratio in $(\beta)$ is equal to the ratio
$AK \cdot NH : AK \cdot AN$, or $NH : AN$.

Therefore

(segment $A'PP'$) : (cone or segment of cone $A'PP'$)
$= NH : AN$
$= CA + AN : AN$.
