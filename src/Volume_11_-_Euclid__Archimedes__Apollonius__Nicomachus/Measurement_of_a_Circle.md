# Measurement of a Circle

## Proposition 1

The area of any circle is equal to a right-angled triangle in which one of the sides about the right angle is equal to the radius, and the other to the circumference, of the circle.

Let ABCD be the given circle, K the triangle described.

Then, if the circle is not equal to K, it must be either greater or less.

I. If possible, let the circle be greater than K.

Inscribe a square ABCD, bisect the arcs AB, BC, CD, DA, then bisect (if necessary) the halves, and so on, until the sides of the inscribed polygon whose angular points are the points of division subtend segments whose sum is less than the excess of the area of the circle over K.

Thus the area of the polygon is greater than K.

Let AE be any side of it, and ON the perpendicular on AE from the centre O.

Then ON is less than the radius of the circle and therefore less than one of the sides about the right angle in K. Also the perimeter of the polygon is less than the circumference of the circle, *i.e.* less than the other side about the right angle in K.

Therefore the area of the polygon is less than K; which is inconsistent with the hypothesis.

Thus the area of the circle is not greater than K.

II. If possible, let the circle be less than K.

Circumscribe a square, and let two adjacent sides, touching the circle in E, H, meet in T. Bisect the arcs between adjacent points of contact and draw the tangents at the points of bisection. Let A be the middle point of the arc EH, and FAG the tangent at A.

Then the angle TAG is a right angle.

Therefore TG > GA
>GH.

It follows that the triangle FTG is greater than half the area TEAH.

Similarly, if the arc AH be bisected and the tangent at the point of bisection be drawn, it will cut off from the area GAH more than one-half.

Thus, by continuing the process, we shall ultimately arrive at a circumscribed polygon such that the spaces intercepted between it and the circle are together less than the excess of K over the area of the circle.

Thus the area of the polygon will be less than K.

Now, since the perpendicular from O on any side of the polygon is equal to the radius of the circle, while the perimeter of the polygon is greater than the circumference of the circle, it follows that the area of the polygon is greater than the triangle K; which is impossible.

Therefore the area of the circle is not less than K.

Since then the area of the circle is neither greater nor less than K, it is equal to it.

## Proposition 2

The area of a circle is to the square on its diameter as 11 to 14.[^1]

## Proposition 3

The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is less than 3 1/7 but greater than 3 10/71.[^2]

I. Let AB be the diameter of any circle, O its centre, AC the tangent at A; and let the angle AOC be one-third of a right angle.

Then OA : AC[ = √3 : 1] > 265 : 153, (1)
and OC:CA[ = 2 : 1] = 306 : 153. (2)

First, draw OD bisecting the angle AOC and meeting AC in D.

Now CO : OA = CD:DA, [Eucl. VI. 3]
so that [CO+OA : OA = CA : DA, or]
CO+OA : CA = OA : AD.

Therefore [by (1) and (2)]
OA : AD > 571 1/4 : 153. (3)

Hence OD^2 : AD^2 [= (OA^2+AD^2) : AD^2
> (571 1/4)^2 + 153^2) : 153^2]
>349450 : 23409,
so that OD : DA > 591 1/8 : 153. (4)

Secondly, let OE bisect the angle AOD, meeting AD in E.

[Then DO : OA = DE : EA,
so that DO+OA : DA = OA : AE.]

Therefore OA : AE [> (591 1/8 + 571 1/4) : 153, by (3) and (4)]
>1162 1/8 : 153. (5)

[It follows that
OE^2 : EA^2 > {(1162 1/8)^2 + 153^2} : 153^2
> (1350534 1/16 + 23409) : 23409
>1373943 1/16 : 23409.]

Thus OE : EA >1172 1/8 : 153. (6)

Thirdly, let OF bisect the angle AOE and meet AE in F.

We thus obtain the result [corresponding to (3) and (5) above] that
OA : AF[> (1162 1/8 + 1172 1/8) : 153]
> 2334 1/4 : 153. (7)

[Therefore OF^2 : FA^2 > { (2334 1/4)^2 + 153^2} : 153^2
>5472132 1/16 : 23409.]

Thus OF : FA > 2339 1/4 : 153. (8)

Fourthly, let OG bisect the angle AOF, meeting AE in G.

We have then
OA : AG [> (2334 1/4 + 2339 1/4) : 153, by means of (7) and (8)]
>4673 1/2 : 153.

Now the angle AOC, which is one-third of a right angle, has been bisected four times, and it follows that
∠AOG = 1/48 (a right angle).

Make the angle AOI on the other side of OA equal to the angle AOG, and let GA produced meet OI in I.

Then ∠GOI (a right angle).

Thus GI is one side of a regular polygon of 96 sides circumscribed to the given circle.

And, since OA : AG > 4673 1/2 : 153,
while AB = 2OA, GI = 2AG,
it follows that
AB : (perimeter of polygon of 96 sides) [>4673 1/2 : 153 * 96]
> 4673 1/2 : 14688.

But
14688 / 4673 1/2 < 3 1/7.

Therefore the circumference of the circle (being less than the perimeter of the polygon) is *a fortiori* less than 3 1/7 times the diameter AB.

II. Next let AB be the diameter of a circle, and let AC, meeting the circle in C, make the angle CAB equal to one-third of a right angle. Join BC.

Then AC : CB[ = √3 : 1] < 1351 : 780.

First, let AD bisect the angle BAC and meet BC in d and the circle in D. Join BD.

Then ∠BAD = ∠dAC
= ∠dBD,
and the angles at D, C are both right angles.

It follows that the triangles ADB, [ACd], BDd are similar.

Therefore
AD :DB=BD :Dd
[ =AC:Cd]
=AB :Bd
= AB+AC : Bd+Cd
=AB+AC:BC
[Eucl. VI. 3]
or
BA+AC :BC= AD :DB.

[But
AC : CB < 1351 : 780, from above,
while
BA :BC= 2 : 1
= 1560 : 780.]

Therefore
AD :DB< 2911 : 780. (1)

[Hence
AB^2 : BD^2 < (2911^2+780^2) : 780^2
<9082321 : 608400.]

Thus
AB : BD <3013 3/4 : 780. (2)

Secondly, let AE bisect the angle BAD, meeting the circle in E; and let BE be joined.

Then we prove,
in the same way as before, that
AE :EB[=BA+AD:BD
<(3013 3/4+2911) : 780, by (1) and (2)]
<5924 3/4 : 780
<1823 : 240. (3)

[Hence
AB^2 : BE^2 < (1823^2 + 240^2) : 240^2
<3380929 : 57600.]

Therefore
AB : BE <1838 9/11 : 240. (4)

Thirdly, let AF bisect the angle BAE, meeting the circle in F.

Thus AF :FB[=BA+AE :BE
<3661 9/11 : 240, by (3) and (4)]
<1007:66. (5)

[It follows that
AB^2 : BF^2 < (1007^2+66^2) : 66^2
<1018405 : 4356.]

Therefore AB : BF <1009 1/6 : 66. (6)

Fourthly, let the angle BAF be bisected by AG meeting the circle in G.

Then AG : GB[=BA+AF : BF]
<2016 1/2 : 66, by (5) and (6).

[And AB^2 : BG^2 < {(2016 1/2)^2+66^2} : 66^2
<4069284 1/4 : 4356.]

Therefore AB : BG <2017 1/4 : 66,
whence BG : AB > 66 : 2017 1/4. (7)

[Now the angle BAG which is the result of the fourth bisection of the angle BAC, or of one-third of a right angle, is equal to one-fortyeighth of a right angle.

Thus the angle subtended by BG at the centre is
1/24 (a right angle).]

Therefore BG is a side of a regular inscribed polygon of 96 sides.

It follows from (7) that
(perimeter of polygon) : AB [>96 * 66 : 2017 1/4]
>6336 : 2017 1/4.

And
6336 / 2017 1/4 > 3 10/71.

Much more then is the circumference of the circle greater than 3 10/71 times the diameter.

Thus the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
< 3 1/7 but > 3 10/71.

> “In this book I have set forth and send you the proofs of the remaining theorems not included in what I sent you before, and also of some others discovered later which, though I had often tried to investigate them previously, I had failed to arrive at because I found their discovery attended with some difficulty. And this is why even the propositions themselves were not published with the rest. But afterwards, when I had studied them with greater care, I discovered what I had failed in before.
>
> “Now the remainder of the earlier theorems were propositions concerning the right-angled conoid [paraboloid of revolution]; but the discoveries which I have now added relate to an obtuse-angled conoid [hyperboloid of revolution] and to spheroidal figures, some of which I call oblong and others flat.”
>
> I. “Concerning the right-angled conoid it was laid down that, if a section of a right-angled cone [a parabola] be made to revolve about the diameter [axis] which remains fixed and return to the position from which it started, the figure comprehended by the section of the right-angled cone is called a right-angled conoid, and the diameter which has remained fixed is called its axis, while its vertex is the point in which the axis meets the surface of the conoid. And if a plane touch the right-angled conoid, and another plane drawn parallel to the tangent plane cut off a segment of the conoid, the base of the segment cut off is defined as the portion intercepted by the section of the conoid on the cutting plane, the vertex [of the segment] as the point in which the first plane touches the conoid, and the axis [of the segment] as the portion cut off within the segment from the line drawn through the vertex of the segment parallel to the axis of the conoid.

If there be in a plane a section of an obtuse-angled cone [a hyperbola], its diameter [axis], and the nearest lines to the section of the obtuse-angled cone [*i.e.* the asymptotes of the hyperbola], and if, the diameter [axis] remaining fixed, the plane containing the aforesaid lines be made to revolve about it and return to the position from which it started, the nearest lines to the section of the obtuse-angled cone [the asymptotes] will clearly comprehend an isosceles cone whose vertex will be the point of concourse of the nearest lines and whose axis will be the diameter [axis] which has remained fixed. The figure comprehended by the section of the obtuse-angled cone is called an obtuse-angled conoid [hyperboloid of revolution], its axis is the diameter which has remained fixed, and its vertex the point in which the axis meets the surface of the conoid. The cone comprehended by the nearest lines to the section of the obtuse-angled cone is called [the cone] enveloping the conoid, and the straight line between the vertex of the conoid and the vertex of the cone enveloping the conoid is called [the line] adjacent to the axis. And if a plane touch the obtuse-angled conoid, and another plane drawn parallel to the tangent plane cut off a segment of the conoid, the base of the segment so cut off is defined as the portion intercepted by the section of the conoid on the cutting plane, the vertex [of the segment] as the point of contact of the plane which touches the conoid, the axis [of the segment] as the portion cut off within the segment from the line drawn through the vertex of the segment and the vertex of the cone enveloping the conoid; and the straight line between the said vertices is called adjacent to the axis.

>
> III. “Concerning spheroidal figures we lay down the following premisses. If a section of an acute-angled cone [ellipse] be made to revolve about the greater diameter [major axis] which remains fixed and return to the position from which it started, the figure comprehended by the section of the acute-angled cone is called an oblong spheroid. But if the section of the acute-angled cone revolve about the lesser diameter [minor axis] which remains fixed and return to the position from which it started, the figure comprehended by the section of the acute-angled cone is called a flat spheroid. In either of the spheroids the axis is defined as the diameter [axis] which has remained fixed, the vertex as the point in which the axis meets the surface of the spheroid, the centre as the middle point of the axis, and the diameter as the line drawn through the centre at right angles to the axis. And, if parallel planes touch, without cutting, either of the spheroidal figures, and if another plane be drawn parallel to the tangent planes and cutting the spheroid, the base of the resulting segments is defined as the portion intercepted by the section of the spheroid on the cutting plane, their vertices as the points in which the parallel planes touch the spheroid, and their axes as the portions cut off within the segments from the straight line joining their vertices. And that the planes touching the spheroid meet its surface at one point only, and that the straight line joining the points of contact passes through the centre of the spheroid, we shall prove. Those spheroidal figures are called similar in which the axes have the same ratio to the 'diameters,' And let segments of spheroidal figures and conoids be called similar if they are cut off from similar figures and have their bases similar, while their axes, being either at right angles to the planes of the bases or making equal angles with the corresponding diameters [axes] of the bases, have the same ratio to one another as the corresponding diameters [axes] of the bases.

>
> (2) “why, if one of the spheroids be cut by a plane passing through the centre but not at right angles to the axis, each of the resulting segments will be double of the figure having the same base as the segment and the same axis and consisting of a segment of a cone.

> (3) “But, if the plane cutting the spheroid be neither through the centre nor at right angles to the axis, (a) the greater of the resulting segments will have to the figure which has the same base as the segment and the same axis the ratio which the line equal to the sum of half the line joining the vertices of the segments and the axis of the lesser segment bears to the axis of the lesser segment, and (b) the lesser segment will have to the figure with the same base as the segment and the same axis the ratio which the line equal to the sum of half the line joining the vertices of the segments and the axis of the greater segment bears to the axis of the greater segment.

## Definitions

> “If a cone be cut by a plane meeting all the sides [generators] of the cone, the section will be either a circle or a section of an acute-angled cone [an ellipse]. If then the section be a circle, it is clear that the segment cut off from the cone towards the same parts as the vertex of the cone will be a cone. But, if the section be a section of an acute-angled cone [an ellipse], let the figure cut off from the cone towards the same parts as the vertex of the cone be called a segment of a cone. Let the base of the segment be defined as the plane comprehended by the section of the acute-angled cone, its vertex as the point which is also the vertex of the cone, and its axis as the straight line joining the vertex of the cone to the centre of the section of the acute-angled cone.
>
> “And if a cylinder be cut by two parallel planes meeting all the sides [generators] of the cylinder, the sections will be either circles or sections of acute-angled cones [ellipses] equal and similar to one another. If then the sections be circles, it is clear that the figure cut off from the cylinder between the parallel planes will be a cylinder. But, if the sections be sections of acute-angled cones [ellipses], let the figure cut off from the cylinder between the parallel planes be called a frustum of a cylinder. And let the bases of the frustum be defined as the planes comprehended by the sections of the acute-angled cones [ellipses], and the axis as the straight line joining the centres of the sections of the acute-angled cones, so that the axis will be in the same straight line with the axis of the cylinder.”

## Lemma

If in an ascending arithmetical progression consisting of the magnitudes A1, A2, • • • An the common difference be equal to the least term A1, then
n * An < 2(A1+A2+ • • • +An),
and >2(A1+A2+ • • • +An-1).

[The proof of this is given incidentally in the treatise *On Spirals*, Prop. 11. By placing lines side by side to represent the terms of the progression and then producing each so as to make it equal to the greatest term, Archimedes gives the equivalent of the following proof.

If Sn = A1 + A2 + • • • + An-1 + An
we have also Sn=An+An-1+An-2+ • • •+A1.
And A1+An-1 = A2+An-2 = • • • = An.
Therefore 2Sn = (n+1)An,
whence n * An < 2Sn,
and n * An > 2Sn-1.

Thus, if the progression is a, 2a, • • na,
Sn = n(n+1)a / 2,
and na < 2Sn,
but >2Sn-1.]

## Proposition 1

If A1, B1, C1, • • • K1 and A2, B2, C2, • • • K2 be two series of magnitudes such that
A1 : B1 = A2 : B2,
B1 : C1 = B2 : C2, and so on,
and if A3, B3, C3, • • • K3 and A4, B4, C4, • • • K4 be two other series such that
A1 : A3 = A2 : A4,
B1 : B3 = B2 : B4, and so on,
then (A1+B1+C1+ • • • +K1) : (A3+B3+C3+ • • • +K3)
= (A2+B2+C2+ • • • +K2) : (A4+B4+C4+ • • • +K4).

The proof is as follows.

Since A3 : A1 = A4 : A2,
and A1 : B1 = A2 : B2,
while B1 : B3 = B2 : B4,
we have, *ex aequali*, A3 : B3 = A4 : B4.
Similarly B3 : C3 = B4 : C4, and so on.

Again, it follows from equations (α) that
A1 : A2 = B1 : B2 = C1 : C2 = • • • = K1 : K2.

Therefore
A1 : A2 = (A1+B1+C1+ • • • +K1) : (A2+B2+C2+ • • • +K2),
or (A1+B1+C1+ • • • +K1) : A1 = (A2+B2+C2+ • • • +K2) : A2;
and A1 : A3 = A2 : A4,
while from equations (γ) it follows in like manner that
A3 : (A3+B3+C3+ • • • +K3) = A4 : (A4+B4+C4+ • • • +K4).

By the last three equations, *ex aequali*,
(A1+B1+C1+ • • • +K1) : (A3+B3+C3+ • • • +K3)
= (A2+B2+C2+ • • • +K2) : (A4+B4+C4+ • • • +K4).

Cor. If any terms in the third and fourth series corresponding to terms in the first and second be left out, the result is the same. For example, if the last terms K3, K4 are absent,
(A1+B1+C1+ • • • +K1) : (A3+B3+C3+ • • • +L3)
= (A2+B2+C2+ • • • +K2) : (A4+B4+C4+ • • • +L4),
where L immediately precedes K in each series.

## Lemma to Proposition 2
[*On Spirals*, Prop. 10.]

If A1, A2, A3, • • • An be n lines forming an ascending arithmetical progression in which the common difference is equal to the least term A1, then
(n+1)An^2 + A1(A1+A2+A3+ • • • +An) = 3(A1^2+A2^2+A3^2+ • • • +An^2).
Let the lines An, An-1, An-2, • • • ,A1 be placed in a row from left to right.
Produce An-1, An-2, • • • A1 until they are each equal to An, so that the parts produced are respectively equal to A1, A2, • • • ,An-1.

Taking each line successively, we have
2An^2 = 2An^2,
(A1+An-1)^2 = A1^2+An-1^2+2A1 * An-1,
(A2+An-2)^2 = A2^2+An-2^2+2A2 * An-2,

[^1]: The text of this proposition is not satisfactory, and Archimedes cannot have placed it before Proposition 3, as the approximation depends upon the result of that proposition.
[^2]: In view of the interesting questions arising out of the arithmetical content of this proposition of Archimedes, it is necessary, in reproducing it, to distinguish carefully the actual steps set out in the text as we have it from the intermediate steps (mostly supplied by Eutocius) which it is convenient to put in for the purpose of making the proof easier to follow. Accordingly all the steps not actually appearing in the text have been enclosed in square brackets, in order that it may be clearly seen how far Archimedes omits actual calculations and only gives results. It will be observed that he gives two fractional approximations to √3 (one being less and the other greater than the real value) without any explanation as to how he arrived at them; and in like manner approximations to the square roots of several large numbers which are not complete squares are merely stated.
[^3]: The whole of this introductory matter, including the definitions, is translated literally from the Greek text in order that the terminology of Archimedes may be faithfully represented. When this has once been set out, nothing will be lost by returning to modern phraseology and notation. These will accordingly be employed, as usual, when we come to the actual propositions of the treatise.
