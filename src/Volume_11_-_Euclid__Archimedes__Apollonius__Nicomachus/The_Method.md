# The Method Treating of Mechanical Problems

“Archimedes to Eratosthenes greeting.

“I sent you on a former occasion some of the theorems discovered by me, merely writing out the enunciations and inviting you to discover the proofs, which at the moment I did not give. The enunciations of the theorems which I sent were as follows:

1.  “If in a right prism with a parallelogrammic base a cylinder be inscribed which has its bases in the opposite parallelograms,^1 and its sides [i.e. four generators] on the remaining planes (faces) of the prism, and if through the centre of the circle which is the base of the cylinder and (through) one side of the square in the plane opposite to it a plane be drawn, the plane so drawn will cut off from the cylinder a segment which is bounded by two planes and the surface of the cylinder, one of the two planes being the plane which has been drawn and the other the plane in which the base of the cylinder is, and the surface being that which is between the said planes; and the segment cut off from the cylinder is one sixth part of the whole prism.

2.  “If in a cube a cylinder be inscribed which has its bases in the opposite parallelograms,^2 and touches with its surface the remaining four planes (faces), and if there also be inscribed in the same cube another cylinder which has its bases in other parallelograms and touches with its surface the remaining four planes (faces), then the figure bounded by the surfaces of the cylinders, which is within both cylinders, is two-thirds of the whole cube.

“Now these theorems differ in character from those communicated before; for we compared the figures then in question, conoids and spheroids and segments of them, in respect to size, with figures of cones and cylinders: but none of those figures have yet been found to be equal to a solid figure bounded by planes; whereas each of the present figures bounded by two planes and surfaces of cylinders is found to be equal to one of the solid figures which are bounded by planes. The proofs then of these theorems I have written in this book and now send to you. Seeing moreover in you, as I say, an earnest student, a man of considerable eminence in philosophy, and an admirer [of mathematical inquiry], I thought fit to write out for you and explain in detail in the same book the peculiarity of a certain method, by which it will be possible for you to get a start to enable you to investigate some of the problems in mathematics by means of mechanics. This procedure is, I am persuaded, no less useful even for the proof of the theorems themselves; for certain things first became clear to me by a mechanical method, although they had to be demonstrated by geometry afterwards because their investigation by the said method did not furnish an actual demonstration. But it is of course easier, when we have previously acquired, by the method, some knowledge of the questions, to supply the proof than it is to find it without any previous knowledge. This is a reason why, in the case of the theorems the proof of which Eudoxus was the first to discover, namely that the cone is a third part of the cylinder, and the pyramid of the prism, having the same base and equal height, we should give no small share of the credit to Democritus who was the first to make the assertion with regard to the said figure though he did not prove it. I am myself in the position of having first made the discovery of the theorem now to be published [by the method indicated], and I deem it necessary to expound the method partly because I have already spoken of it and I do not want to be thought to have uttered vain words, but equally because I am persuaded that it will be of no little service to mathematics; for I apprehend that some, either of my contemporaries or of my successors, will, by means of the method when once established, be able to discover other theorems in addition, which have not yet occurred to me.

“First then I will set out the very first theorem which became known to me by means of mechanics, namely that

“Any segment of a section of a right-angled cone (*i.e.* a parabola) is four-thirds of the triangle which has the same base and equal height,

and after this I will give each of the other theorems investigated by the same method. Then, at the end of the book, I will give the geometrical” [proofs of the propositions]...

[I premise the following propositions which I shall use in the course of the work.]

1.  “If from [one magnitude another magnitude be subtracted which has not the same centre of gravity, the centre of gravity of the remainder is found by] producing [the straight line joining the centres of gravity of the whole magnitude and of the subtracted part in the direction of the centre of gravity of the whole] and cutting off from it a length which has to the distance between the said centres of gravity the ratio which the weight of the subtracted magnitude has to the weight of the remainder.” [*On the Equilibrium of Planes*, i. 8]

2.  “If the centres of gravity of any number of magnitudes whatever be on the same straight line, the centre of gravity of the magnitude made up of all of them will be on the same straight line.” [Cf. *Ibid.* i. 5]

3.  “The centre of gravity of any straight line is the point of bisection of the straight line.” [Cf. *Ibid.* i. 4]

4.  “The centre of gravity of any triangle is the point in which the straight lines drawn from the angular points of the triangle to the middle points of the (opposite) sides cut one another.” [*Ibid.* i. 13, 14]

5.  “The centre of gravity of any parallelogram is the point in which the diagonals meet.” [*Ibid.* i. 10]

6.  “The centre of gravity of a circle is the point which is also the centre [of the circle].”

7.  “The centre of gravity of any cylinder is the point of bisection of the axis.”

8.  “The centre of gravity of any cone is [the point which divides its axis so that] the portion [adjacent to the vertex is] triple [of the portion adjacent to the base].”

^1 The parallelograms are apparently squares.
^2 *i.e.* squares.

[All these propositions have already been] proved.^1 [Besides these I require also the following proposition, which is easily proved:

If in two series of magnitudes those of the first series are, in order, proportional to those of the second series and further], “the magnitudes [of the first series], either all or some of them, are in any ratio whatever [to those of a third series], and if the magnitudes of the second series are in the same ratio to the corresponding magnitudes [of a fourth series], then the sum of the magnitudes of the first series has to the sum of the selected magnitudes of the third series the same ratio which the sum of the magnitudes of the second series has to the sum of the (correspondingly) selected magnitudes of the fourth series.” [*On Conoids and Spheroids*, Prop. 1]

### Proposition 1

Let ABC be a segment of a parabola bounded by the straight line AC and the parabola ABC, and let D be the middle point of AC. Draw the straight line DBE parallel to the axis of the parabola and join AB, BC.

Then shall the segment ABC be 4/3 of the triangle ABC.

From A draw AKF parallel to DE, and let the tangent to the parabola at C meet DBE in E and AKF in F. Produce CB to meet AF in K, and again produce CK to H, making KH equal to CK.

Consider CH as the bar of a balance, K being its middle point.

Let MO be any straight line parallel to ED, and let it meet CF, CK, AC in M, N, O and the curve in P.

Now, since CE is a tangent to the parabola and CD the semi-ordinate,
EB = BD;
for this is proved in the *Elements* [of Conics].^2
Since FA, MO are parallel to ED, it follows that
FK = KA, MN = NO.

Now, by the property of the parabola, “proved in a lemma,”
MO : OP = CA : AO [Cf. *Quadrature of Parabola*, Prop. 5]
= CK : KN [Euclid vi. 2]
= HK : KN.

Take a straight line TG equal to OP, and place it with its centre of gravity at H, so that TH = HG; then, since N is the centre of gravity of the straight line MO, and
MO : TG = HK : KN,
it follows that TG at H and MO at N will be in equilibrium about K. [*On the Equilibrium of Planes*, i. 6, 7]

Similarly, for all other straight lines parallel to DE and meeting the arc of the parabola, (1) the portion intercepted between FC, AC with its middle point on KC and (2) a length equal to the intercept between the curve and AC placed with its centre of gravity at H will be in equilibrium about K.

Therefore K is the centre of gravity of the whole system consisting (1) of all the straight lines as MO intercepted between FC, AC and placed as they actually are in the figure and (2) of all the straight lines placed at H equal to the straight lines as PO intercepted between the curve and AC.

And, since the triangle CFA is made up of all the parallel lines like MO, and the segment CBA is made up of all the straight lines like PO within the curve,
it follows that the triangle, placed where it is in the figure, is in equilibrium about K with the segment CBA placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Divide KC at W so that CK = 3KW;
then W is the centre of gravity of the triangle ACF; “for this is proved in the books on equilibrium” (ἐν τοῖς ἰσορροπικοῖς).
[Cf. *On the Equilibrium of Planes* i. 15]

Therefore ΔACF : (segment ABC) = HK : KW
= 3:1.
Therefore segment ABC = 1/3 ΔACF.
But ΔACF = 4ΔABC.
Therefore segment ABC = 4/3 ΔABC.

“Now the fact here stated is not actually demonstrated by the argument used; but that argument has given a sort of indication that the conclusion is true. Seeing then that the theorem is not demonstrated, but at the same time suspecting that the conclusion is true, we shall have recourse to the geometrical demonstration which I myself discovered and have already published.”

### Proposition 2

We can investigate by the same method the propositions that

(1) Any sphere is (in respect of solid content) four times the cone with base equal to a great circle of the sphere and height equal to its radius; and

(2) the cylinder with base equal to a great circle of the sphere and height equal to the diameter is 1 1/2 times the sphere.

(1) Let ABCD be a great circle of a sphere, and AC, BD diameters at right angles to one another.

Let a circle be drawn about BD as diameter and in a plane perpendicular to AC, and on this circle as base let a cone be described with A as vertex. Let the surface of this cone be produced and then cut by a plane through C parallel to its base; the section will be a circle on EF as diameter. On this circle as base let a cylinder be erected with height and axis AC, and produce CA to H, making AH equal to CA.

Let CH be regarded as the bar of a balance, A being its middle point.

Draw any straight line MN in the plane of the circle ABCD and parallel to BD. Let MN meet the circle in O, P, the diameter AC in S, and the straight lines AE, AF in Q, R respectively. Join AO.

Through MN draw a plane at right angles to AC;
this plane will cut the cylinder in a circle with diameter EF, the sphere in a circle with diameter OP, and the cone in a circle with diameter QR.

Now, since MS = AC, and QS = AS,
MS * SQ = CA * AS
= AO^2
= OS^2 + SQ^2.

And, since HA = AC,
HA : AS = CA : AS
= MS : SQ
= MS^2 : MS * SQ
= MS^2 : (OS^2 + SQ^2), from above,
= MN^2 : (OP^2 + QR^2)
= (circle, diam. MN) : (circle, diam. OP + circle, diam. QR).

That is,
HA : AS = (circle in cylinder) : (circle in sphere + circle in cone).

Therefore the circle in the cylinder, placed where it is, is in equilibrium, about A, with the circle in the sphere together with the circle in the cone, if both the latter circles are placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Similarly for the three corresponding sections made by a plane perpendicular to AC and passing through any other straight line in the parallelogram LF parallel to EF.

If we deal in the same way with all the sets of three circles in which planes perpendicular to AC cut the cylinder, the sphere and the cone, and which make up those solids respectively, it follows that the cylinder, in the place where it is, will be in equilibrium about A with the sphere and the cone together, when both are placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Therefore, since K is the centre of gravity of the cylinder,
HA : AK = (cylinder) : (sphere + cone AEF).
But HA = 2AK;
therefore cylinder = 2 (sphere + cone AEF).

Now cylinder = 3 (cone AEF); [Euclid xii. 10]
therefore cone AEF = 2 (sphere).
But, since EF = 2BD,
cone AEF = 8 (cone ABD);
therefore sphere = 4 (cone ABD).

(2) Through B, D draw VBW, XDY parallel to AC;
and imagine a cylinder which has AC for axis and the circles on VX, WY as diameters for bases.

Then cylinder VF = 2 (cylinder VD)
= 6 (cone ABD) [Euclid xii. 10]
= 3/2 (sphere), from above.

Q.E.D.

“From this theorem, to the effect that a sphere is four times as great as the cone with a great circle of the sphere as base and with height equal to the radius of the sphere, I conceived the notion that the surface of any sphere is four times as great as a great circle in it; for, judging from the fact that any circle is equal to a triangle with base equal to the circumference and height equal to the radius of the circle, I apprehended that, in like manner, any sphere is equal to a cone with base equal to the surface of the sphere and height equal to the radius.”

### Proposition 3

By this method we can also investigate the theorem that
A cylinder with base equal to the greatest circle in a spheroid and height equal to the axis of the spheroid is 1 1/2 times the spheroid;
and, when this is established, it is plain that
If any spheroid be cut by a plane through the centre and at right angles to the axis, the half of the spheroid is double of the cone which has the same base and the same axis as the segment (*i.e.* the half of the spheroid).

Let a plane through the axis of a spheroid cut its surface in the ellipse ABCD, the diameters (*i.e.* axes) of which are AC, BD; and let K be the centre.

Draw a circle about BD as diameter and in a plane perpendicular to AC; imagine a cone with this circle as base and A as vertex produced and cut by a plane through C parallel to its base; the section will be a circle in a plane at right angles to AC and about EF as diameter.

Imagine a cylinder with the latter circle as base and axis AC; produce CA to H, making AH equal to CA.

Let HC be regarded as the bar of a balance, A being its middle point.

In the parallelogram LF draw any straight line MN parallel to EF meeting the ellipse in O, P and AE, AF, AC in Q, R, S respectively.

If now a plane be drawn through MN at right angles to AC, it will cut the cylinder in a circle with diameter MN, the spheroid in a circle with diameter OP, and the cone in a circle with diameter QR.

Since HA = AC,
HA : AS = CA : AS
= EA : AQ
= MS : SQ.

Therefore
HA : AS = MS^2 : MS * SQ.

But, by the property of the ellipse,
AS * SC : SO^2 = AK^2 : KB^2
= AK^2 : SQ^2;

therefore SQ^2 : SO^2 = AS^2 : AS * SC
= SQ^2 : SQ * SM,
and accordingly SO^2 = SQ * SM.

Add SQ^2 to each side, and we have
SO^2 + SQ^2 = SQ * SM.

Therefore, from above, we have
HA : AS = MS^2 : (SO^2 + SQ^2)
= MN^2 : (OP^2 + QR^2)
= (circle, diam. MN) : (circle, diam. OP + circle, diam. QR).

That is,
HA : AS = (circle in cylinder) : (circle in spheroid + circle in cone).
Therefore the circle in the cylinder, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium, about A, with the circle in the spheroid and the circle in the cone together, if both the latter circles are placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Similarly for the three corresponding sections made by a plane perpendicular to AC and passing through any other straight line in the parallelogram LF parallel to EF.

If we deal in the same way with all the sets of three circles in which planes perpendicular to AC cut the cylinder, the spheroid and the cone, and which make up those figures respectively, it follows that the cylinder, in the place where it is, will be in equilibrium about A with the spheroid and the cone together, when both are placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Therefore, since K is the centre of gravity of the cylinder,
HA : AK = (cylinder) : (spheroid + cone AEF).
But HA = 2AK;
therefore cylinder = 2 (spheroid + cone AEF).

And cylinder = 3 (cone AEF); [Euclid xii. 10]
therefore cone AEF = 2 (spheroid).
But, since EF = 2BD,
cone AEF = 8 (cone ABD);
therefore spheroid = 4 (cone ABD),
and half the spheroid = 2 (cone ABD).

Through B, D draw VBW, XDY parallel to AC;
and imagine a cylinder which has AC for axis and the circles on VX, WY as diameters for bases.

Then cylinder VF = 2 (cylinder VD)
= 6 (cone ABD)
= 3/2 (spheroid), from above.

Q.E.D.

### Proposition 4

Any segment of a right-angled conoid (*i.e.* a paraboloid of revolution) cut off by a plane at right angles to the axis is 1 1/2 times the cone which has the same base and the same axis as the segment.

This can be investigated by our method, as follows.

Let a paraboloid of revolution be cut by a plane through the axis in the parabola BAC;

and let it also be cut by another plane at right angles to the axis and intersecting the former plane in BC. Produce DA, the axis of the segment, to H, making HA equal to AD.

Imagine that HD is the bar of a balance, A being its middle point.

The base of the segment being the circle on BC as diameter and in a plane perpendicular to AD,
imagine (1) a cone drawn with the latter circle as base and A as vertex, and (2) a cylinder with the same circle as base and AD as axis.

In the parallelogram EC let any straight line MN be drawn parallel to BC, and through MN let a plane be drawn at right angles to AD; this plane will cut the cylinder in a circle with diameter MN and the paraboloid in a circle with diameter OP.

Now, BAC being a parabola and BD, OS ordinates,
DA : AS = BD^2 : OS^2,
or HA : AS = MS^2 : SO^2.

Therefore
HA : AS = (circle, rad. MS) : (circle, rad. OS)
= (circle in cylinder) : (circle in paraboloid).

Therefore the circle in the cylinder, in the place where it is, will be in equilibrium about A with the circle in the paraboloid, if the latter is placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Similarly for the two corresponding circular sections made by a plane perpendicular to AD and passing through any other straight line in the parallelogram which is parallel to BC.

Therefore, as usual, if we take all the circles making up the whole cylinder and the whole segment and treat them in the same way, we find that the cylinder, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the segment placed with its centre of gravity at H.

If K is the middle point of AD, K is the centre of gravity of the cylinder;
therefore HA : AK = (cylinder) : (segment).

Therefore cylinder = 2 (segment).

And cylinder = 3 (cone ABC); [Euclid xii. 10]
therefore segment = 2/3 (cone ABC).

### Proposition 5

The centre of gravity of a segment of a right-angled conoid (*i.e.* a paraboloid of revolution) cut off by a plane at right angles to the axis is on the straight line which is the axis of the segment, and divides the said straight line in such a way that the portion of it adjacent to the vertex is double of the remaining portion.

This can be investigated by the method, as follows.

Let a paraboloid of revolution be cut by a plane through the axis in the parabola BAC;

and let it also be cut by another plane at right angles to the axis and intersecting the former plane in BC.

Produce DA, the axis of the segment, to H, making HA equal to AD; and imagine DH to be the bar of a balance, its middle point being A.

The base of the segment being the circle on BC as diameter and in a plane perpendicular to AD,
imagine a cone with this circle as base and A as vertex, so that AB, AC are generators of the cone.

In the parabola let any double ordinate OP be drawn meeting AB, AD, AC in Q, S, R respectively.

Now, from the property of the parabola,
BD^2 : OS^2 = DA : AS
= BD : QS
= BD^2 : BD * QS.
Therefore OS^2 = BD * QS,
or BD : OS = OS : QS,
whence BD : QS = OS^2 : QS^2.

But BD : QS = AD : AS
= HA : AS.

Therefore HA : AS = OS^2 : QS^2
= OP^2 : QR^2.

If now through OP a plane be drawn at right angles to AD, this plane cuts the paraboloid in a circle with diameter OP and the cone in a circle with diameter QR.

We see therefore that HA : AS = (circle, diam. OP) : (circle, diam. QR)
= (circle in paraboloid) : (circle in cone);
and the circle in the paraboloid, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the circle in the cone placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Similarly for the two corresponding circular sections made by a plane perpendicular to AD and passing through any other ordinate of the parabola.

Dealing therefore in the same way with all the circular sections which make up the whole of the segment of the paraboloid and the cone respectively, we see that the segment of the paraboloid, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the cone placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Now, since A is the centre of gravity of the whole system as placed, and the centre of gravity of part of it, namely the cone, as placed, is at H, the centre of gravity of the rest, namely the segment, is at a point K on HA produced such that HA : AK = (segment) : (cone).

But segment = 2/3 (cone). [Prop. 4]

Therefore HA = 2/3 AK;
that is, K divides AD in such a way that AK = 2KD.

### Proposition 6

The centre of gravity of any hemisphere [is on the straight line which] is its axis, and divides the said straight line in such a way that the portion of it adjacent to the surface of the hemisphere has to the remaining portion the ratio which 5 has to 3.

Let a sphere be cut by a plane through its centre in the circle ABCD;
let AC, BD be perpendicular diameters of this circle,
and through BD let a plane be drawn at right angles to AC.

The latter plane will cut the sphere in a circle on BD as diameter.

Imagine a cone with the latter circle as base and A as vertex.

Produce CA to H, making AH equal to CA, and let HC be regarded as the bar of a balance, A being its middle point.

In the semicircle BAD, let any straight line OP be drawn parallel to BD and cutting AC in E and the two generators, AB, AD of the cone in Q, R respectively.

Join AO.

Through OP let a plane be drawn at right angles to AC;
this plane will cut the hemisphere in a circle with diameter OP and the cone in a circle with diameter QR.

Now
HA : AE = AC : AE
= AO^2 : AE^2
= (OE^2 + AE^2) : AE^2
= (OE^2 + QE^2) : QE^2
= (circle, diam. OP + circle, diam. QR) : (circle, diam. QR).

Therefore the circles with diameters OP, QR, in the places where they are, are in equilibrium about A with the circle with diameter QR if the latter is placed with its centre of gravity at H.

And, since the centre of gravity of the two circles with diameters OP, QR taken together, in the place where they are, is . . .

[There is a lacuna here; but the proof can easily be completed on the lines of the corresponding but more difficult case in Prop. 8.

We proceed thus from the point where the circles with diameters OP, QR, in the place where they are, balance, about A, the circle with diameter QR placed with its centre of gravity at H.

A similar relation holds for all the other sets of circular sections made by other planes passing through points on AC and at right angles to AC.

Taking then all the circles which fill up the hemisphere BAD and the cone ABD respectively, we find that
the hemisphere BAD and the cone ABD, in the places where they are, together balance, about A, a cone equal to ABD placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Let the cylinder M+N be equal to the cone ABD.

Then, since the cylinder M+N placed with its centre of gravity at H balances the hemisphere BAD and the cone ABD in the places where they are, suppose that the portion M of the cylinder, placed with its centre of gravity at H, balances the cone ABD (alone) in the place where it is; therefore the portion N of the cylinder placed with its centre of gravity at H balances the hemisphere (alone) in the place where it is.

Now the centre of gravity of the cone is at a point V such that AC = 4GV;
therefore, since M at H is in equilibrium with the cone,
M : (cone) = 1/4 AC : HA = 1/4 AC : AC,
whence M = 1/4 (cone).

But M + N = (cone); therefore N = 3/4 (cone).

Now let the centre of gravity of the hemisphere be at W, which is somewhere on AC.

Then, since N at H balances the hemisphere alone,
(hemisphere) : N = HA : AW.

But the hemisphere BAD = twice the cone ABD;
[*On the Sphere and Cylinder* i. 34 and Prop. 2 above]
and N = 3/4 (cone), from above.

Therefore 2 : 3/4 = HA : AW
= AC : AW,
whence AW = 3/8 AC, so that W divides AC in such a way that
AW : WC = 3 : 5.]

### Proposition 7

We can also investigate by the same method the theorem that
[Any segment of a sphere has] to the cone [with the same base and height the ratio which the sum of the radius of the sphere and the height of the complementary segment has to the height of the complementary segment.]

[There is a lacuna here; but all that is missing is the construction, and the construction is easily understood by means of the figure. BAD is of course the segment of the sphere the volume of which is to be compared with the volume of a cone with the same base and height.]

The plane drawn through MN and at right angles to AC will cut the cylinder in a circle with diameter MN, the segment of the sphere in a circle with diameter OP, and the cone on the base EF in a circle with diameter QR.

In the same way as before [cf. Prop. 2] we can prove that the circle with diameter MN, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the two circles with diameters OP, QR if these circles are both

moved and placed with their
centres of gravity at H.

The same thing can be proved of all sets of three circles in which the
cylinder, the segment of the sphere, and the cone with the common height AG are
all cut by any plane perpendicular to AC.

Since then the sets of circles make up the whole cylinder, the whole segment
of the sphere and the whole cone respectively, it follows that the cylinder, in
the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the sum of the segment of
the sphere and the cone if both are placed with their centres of gravity at H.
Divide AG at W, V in such a way that
AW = WG, AV = 3VG.

Therefore W will be the centre of gravity of the cylinder, and V will be the
centre of gravity of the cone.

Since, now, the bodies are in equilibrium as described,
(cylinder) : (cone AEF + segment BAD of sphere) = HA : AW.

[The rest of the proof is lost; but it can easily be supplied thus:

We have
(cone AEF + segment BAD) : (cylinder) = AW : AC
= AW · AC : AC².

But (cylinder) : (cone AEF) = AC² : ½EG²
= AC² : ½AG².

Therefore, ex aequali,
(cone AEF + segment BAD) : (cone AEF) = AW · AC : ½AG²
whence (segment BAD) : (cone AEF) = (½AC - ½AG) : ½AG.

Again (cone AEF) : (cone ABD) = EG² : DG²
= AG² : (AG · GC)
= AG : GC
= ½AG : ½GC.

Therefore, ex aequali,
(segment BAD) : (cone ABD) = (½AC - ½AG) : ½GC
= (AC - AG) : GC
= (½AC + GC) : GC. q.e.d.]

Produce AC to H, O, making HA equal to AC and CO equal to the radius of
the sphere;
and let HC be regarded as the bar of a balance, the middle point being A.

In the plane cutting off the segment describe a circle with G as centre and
radius (GE) equal to AG; and on this circle as base, and with A as vertex, let a
cone be described. AE, AF are generators of this cone.

Draw KL, through any point Q on AG, parallel to EF and cutting the seg-
ment in K, L, and AE, AF in R, P respectively. Join AK.

Now
HA : AQ = CA : AQ
= AK² : AQ²
= (KQ² + QA²) : QA²
= (KQ² + PQ²) : PQ².

= (circle, diam. KL + circle, diam. PR) : (circle, diam. PR).

Imagine a circle equal to the circle with diameter PR placed with its centre of gravity at H;
therefore the circles on diameters KL, PR, in
the places where they are, are in equilibrium
about A with the circle with diameter PR
placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Similarly for the corresponding circular sec-
tions made by any other plane perpendicular
to AG.

Therefore, taking all the circular sections
which make up the segment ABD of the sphere
and the cone AEF respectively, we find that
the segment ABD of the sphere and the cone
AEF, in the places where they are, are in equi-
librium with the cone AEF assumed to be
placed with its centre of gravity at H.

Let the cylinder M+N be equal to the cone
AEF which has A for vertex and the circle on
EF as diameter for base.

Divide AG at V so that
AG = 4VG;

therefore V is the centre of gravity of the cone AEF;
> "for this has been proved before."

Let the cylinder M+N be cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis in such
a way that the cylinder M (alone), placed with its centre of gravity at H, is in
equilibrium with the cone AEF.

Since M+N suspended at H is in equilibrium with the segment ABD of the
sphere and the cone AEF in the places where they are,
while M, also at H, is in equilibrium with the cone AEF in the place where it is,
it follows that
N at H is in equilibrium with the segment ABD of the sphere in the place
where it is.

Now (segment ABD of sphere) : (cone ABD) = OG : GC;
> "for this is already proved" [Cf. *On the Sphere and Cylinder* II. 2 Cor. as well
> as Prop. 7 ante].

And (cone ABD) : (cone AEF)
= (circle, diam. BD) : (circle, diam. EF)
= BD² : EF²
= BG² : GE²
= CG · GA : GA²
= CG : GA.

Therefore, ex aequali,
(segment ABD of sphere) : (cone AEF) = OG : GA.

Take a point W on AG such that
AW : WG = (GA + 4GC) : (GA + 2GC).

We have then, inversely,
GW : WA = (2GC + GA) : (4GC + GA),

and, componendo,
GA : AW = (6GC + 2GA) : (4GC + GA).

But GO = ½(6GC + 2GA), [for GO - GC = ½(CG + GA)]
and GF = ½(4GC + GA);

therefore GA : AW = OG : GF,
and, alternately and inversely,
OG : GA = GF : AW.

It follows, from above, that
(segment ABD of sphere) : (cone AEF) = GF : AW.

Now, since the cylinder M with its centre of gravity at H is in equilibrium
about A with the cone AEF with its centre of gravity at V,
(cone AEF) : (cylinder M) = HA : AV
= CA : AV;

and, since the cone AEF = the cylinder M+N, we have, dividendo and invertendo,
(cylinder M) : (cylinder N) = AV : CV.

Hence, componendo,
(cone AEF) : (cylinder N) = CA : CV
= HA : CV.

But it was proved that
(segment ABD of sphere) : (cone AEF) = GF : AW;
therefore, ex aequali,
(segment ABD of sphere) : (cylinder N) = HA : AW.

And it was above proved that the cylinder N at H is in equilibrium about A
with the segment ABD, in the place where it is;
therefore, since H is the centre of gravity of the cylinder N, W is the centre
of gravity of the segment ABD of the sphere.

### Proposition 9

In the same way we can investigate the theorem that
> The centre of gravity of any segment of a sphere is on the straight line which is
> the axis of the segment, and divides this straight line in such a way that the part
> of it adjacent to the vertex of the segment has to the remaining part the ratio which
> the sum of the axis of the segment and four times the axis of the complementary
> segment has to the sum of the axis of the segment and double the axis of the com-
> plementary segment.

> [As this theorem relates to “any segment” but states the same result as that
> proved in the preceding proposition, it follows that Prop. 8 must have related
> to one kind of segment, either a segment greater than a semicircle (as in Hei-
> berg's figure of Prop. 8) or a segment less than a semicircle; and the present
> proposition completed the proof for both kinds of segments. It would only
> require a slight change in the figure, in any case.]

### Proposition 10

By this method too we can investigate the theorem that
> [A segment of an obtuse-angled conoid (i.e. a hyperboloid of revolution) has to
> the cone which has] the same base [as the segment and equal height the same ratio
> as the sum of the axis of the segment and three times] the "annex to the axis" (i.e.

> of the "annex" [this is the theorem proved in *On Conoids and Spheroids*, Prop.
> 25],
> "and also many other theorems, which, as the method has been made clear
> by means of the foregoing examples, I will omit, in order that I may now pro-

### Proposition 11

Let there be a right prism with a cylinder in-
scribed as stated.

Let the prism be cut through the axis of the
prism and cylinder by a plane perpendicular to
the plane which cuts off the portion of the cylin-
der; let this plane make, as section, the parallelo-
gram AB, and let it cut the plane cutting off the
portion of the cylinder (which plane is perpen-
dicular to AB) in the straight line BC.

Let CD be the axis of the prism and cylinder,
let EF bisect it at right angles, and through EF
let a plane be drawn at right angles to CD; this plane will cut the prism in a
square and the cylinder in a circle.

Let MN be the square and OPQR the circle, and let the circle touch the sides
of the square in O, P, Q, R [F, E in the first figure are identical with O, Q
respectively]. Let H be the centre of the circle.

Let KL be the intersection of the plane through EF perpendicular to
the axis of the cylinder and the plane cutting off the portion of the cylinder;
KL is bisected by OHQ [and passes through the middle point of HQ],

Let any chord of the circle, as ST, be drawn perpendicular to HQ, meeting
HQ in W;
and through ST let a plane be drawn at right angles to OQ and produced
on both sides of the plane of the circle OPQR.

The plane so drawn will cut the half cylinder
having the semicircle PQR for section and the
axis of the prism for height in a parallelogram,
one side of which is equal to ST and another is a
generator of the cylinder; and it will also cut the
portion of the cylinder cut off in a parallelogram,
one side of which is equal to ST and the other is
equal and parallel to UV (in the first figure).

UV will be parallel to BY and will cut off,
along EG in the parallelogram DE, the seg-
ment EI equal to QW.

Now, since EC is a parallelogram, and VI is parallel to GC,
EG : GI = YC : CV
= BY : UV
= (Area in half cyl.) : (Area in portion of cyl.).

And EG = HQ, GI = HW, QH = OH;
therefore OH : HW = (Area in half cyl.) : (Area in portion).

Imagine that the parallelogram in the portion of the cylinder is moved and
placed at O so that O is the centre of gravity, and that OQ is the bar of a
balance, H being its middle point.

Then, since W is the centre of gravity of the parallelogram in the half cyl-
inder, it follows from the above that the parallelogram in the half cylinder, in
the place where it is, with its centre of gravity at W, is in equilibrium about H
with the parallelogram in the portion of the cylinder when placed with its
centre of gravity at O.

Similarly for the other parallelogrammic sections made by any plane per-
pendicular to OQ and passing through any other chord in the semicircle PQR
perpendicular to OQ.

If then we take all the parallelograms making up the half cylinder and the
portion of the cylinder respectively, it follows that the half cylinder, in the
place where it is, is in equilibrium about H with the portion of the cylinder cut
off when the latter is placed with its centre of gravity at O.

### Proposition 12

Let the parallelogram (square) MN perpendicular to the axis, with the circle
OPQR and its diameters OQ, PR, be drawn separately.

Join HG, HM, and through them draw planes at right angles to the plane
of the circle, producing them on both sides of that plane.

This produces a prism with triangular section GHM and height equal to the
axis of the cylinder; this prism is ¼ of the original prism circumscribing the
cylinder.

Let LK, UT be drawn parallel to OQ and equidistant from it, cutting the
circle in K, T, RP in S, F, and GH, HM in W, V respectively.

Through LK, UT draw planes at right angles to PR, producing them on
both sides of the plane of the circle;

these planes produce as sections in the half cylinder PQR and in the prism
GHM four parallelograms in which the heights are equal to the axis of the
cylinder, and the other sides are equal to KS, TF, LW, UV respectively.

### Proposition 13

Let there be a right prism with square bases, one of which is ABCD;
in the prism let a cylinder be inscribed, the base of which is the circle EFGH
touching the sides of the square ABCD in E, F, G, H.

Through the centre and through the side corresponding to CD in the square
face opposite to ABCD let a plane be drawn; this will cut off a prism equal
to ½ of the original prism and formed by three parallelograms and two triangles,
the triangles forming opposite faces.

In the semicircle EFG describe the parabola which has FK for axis and
passes through E, G; draw MX parallel to KF meeting GE in M, the parabola
in L, the semicircle in O and CD in X.

Then MX · XL = XF²;
> "for this is clear." [Cf. *Apollonius, Conics* I. 11]

> [The parameter is of course equal to GK or KF.]

Therefore MX : XL = GK² : LS².

Through MX draw a plane at right angles to
EG;
this will produce as sections (1) in the prism cut
off from the whole prism a right-angled triangle,
the base of which is MX, while the perpendicular
is perpendicular at X to the plane ABCD and
equal to the axis of the cylinder, and the hypot-
enuse is in the plane cutting the cylinder, and
(2) in the portion of the cylinder cut off a right-
angled triangle the base of which is MO, while
the perpendicular is the generator of the cylinder
perpendicular at O to the plane KX, and the
hypotenuse is...

If then we denote the portion of the cylinder by 2, the prism is 3, and the
original prism circumscribing the cylinder is 12 (being 4 times the other prism);
therefore the portion of the cylinder = ⅙ (original prism), q.e.d.

### Proposition 14

Let there be a right prism with square bases [and a cylinder inscribed therein
having its base in the square ABCD and touching its sides at E, F, G, H;
let the cylinder be cut by a plane through EG and the side corresponding to
CD in the square face opposite to ABCD.]

This plane cuts off from the prism a prism, and from the cylinder a portion
of it.

It can be proved that the portion of the cylinder cut off by the plane is ⅙
of the whole prism.

But we will first prove that it is possible to inscribe in the portion cut off
from the cylinder, and to circumscribe about it, solid figures made up of
prisms which have equal height and similar triangular bases, in such a way
that the circumscribed figure exceeds the inscribed by less than any assigned
magnitude.

But it was proved that
(prism cut off by oblique plane) < ⅓ (figure inscribed in portion of cylinder).
Now (prism cut off) : (inscribed figure)
= OGD : (Areas inscribed in parabolic segment);
therefore OGD < ⅓ (Areas in parabolic segment):
which is impossible, since
> "it has been proved elsewhere" that the parallelogram DG is 3/2 of the parabolic segment.

Consequently... not greater.

And (all the prisms in prism cut off)
: (all prisms in circumscribed figure)
= (all Areas in OGD) : (all Areas in figure circumscribed about parabolic segment);
therefore
(prism cut off) : (figure circumscribed about portion of cylinder)
= (OGD) : (figure circumscribed about parabolic segment).

But the prism cut off by the oblique plane is > ⅓ of the solid figure circum-
scribed about the portion of the cylinder. ....

> Draw straight lines from A to the four corners of the section in which the

> produced, will meet the plane of the face of the cube opposite to A in four

points forming the four corners of a square in that plane with sides equal to EF or double of the side of the cube, and we thus have a pyramid with A for vertex and the latter square for base.

Complete the prism (parallelepiped) with the same base and height as the pyramid.

Draw in the parallelogram LF any straight line MN parallel to EF, and through MN draw a plane at right angles to AC.

This plane cuts:
(1) the solid included by the two cylinders in a square with side equal to OP,
(2) the prism in a square with side equal to MN, and
(3) the pyramid in a square with side equal to QR.

Produce CA to H, making HA equal to AC, and imagine PC to be the bar of a balance.

Now, as in Prop. 2, since MS = AC, QS = AS,
MS · SQ = CA · AS
= AO²
= OS² + SQ².

Also HA : AS = CA : AS
= MS : SQ
= MS² : MS · SQ
= MS² : (OS² + SQ²), from above,
= MN² : (OP² + QR²)
= (square, side MN) : (sq., side OP + sq., side QR).
Therefore the square with side equal to MN, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the squares with sides equal to OP, QR respectively placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Proceeding in the same way with the square sections produced by other planes perpendicular to AC, we finally prove that the prism, in the place where it is, is in equilibrium about A with the solid included by the two cylinders and the pyramid, both placed with their centres of gravity at H.

Now the centre of gravity of the prism is at K.

Therefore HA : AK = (prism) : (solid + pyramid)
or 2:1 = (prism) : (solid + pyramid).

Therefore 2 (solid) + ⅔ (prism) = (prism).

It follows that
(solid included by cylinders) = ⅙ (prism)
= ⅔ (cube). Q.E.D.

There is no doubt that Archimedes proceeded to, and completed, the rigorous geometrical proof by the method of exhaustion.

As observed by Prof. C. Juel (*Zeuthen l.c.*), the solid in the present proposition is made up of 8 pieces of cylinders of the type of that treated in the preceding proposition. As however the two propositions are separately stated, there is no doubt that Archimedes’ proofs of them were distinct.

In this case AC would be divided into a very large number of equal parts and planes would be drawn through the points of division perpendicular to AC. These planes cut the solid, and also the cube VY, in square sections. Thus we can inscribe and circumscribe to the solid the requisite solid figures made up of element-prisms and differing by less than any assigned solid magnitude; the prisms have square bases and their heights are the small segments of AC. The element-prism in the inscribed and circumscribed figures which has the square equal to OP² for base corresponds to an element-prism in the cube which has for base a square with side equal to that of the cube; and as the ratio of the element-prisms is the ratio OS² : BK², we can use the same auxiliary parabola, and work out the proof in exactly the same way, as in Prop. 14.]
