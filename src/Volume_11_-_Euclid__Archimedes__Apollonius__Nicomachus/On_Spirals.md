# ON SPIRALS

> "Of most of the theorems which I sent to Conon, and of which you ask me from time to time to send you the proofs, the demonstrations are already before you in the books brought to you by Heracleides; and some more are also contained in that which I now send you. Do not be surprised at my taking a considerable time before publishing these proofs. This has been owing to my desire to communicate them first to persons engaged in mathematical studies and anxious to investigate them. In fact, how many theorems in geometry which have seemed at first impracticable are in time successfully worked out! Now Conon died before he had sufficient time to investigate the theorems referred to; otherwise he would have discovered and made manifest all these things, and would have enriched geometry by many other discoveries besides. For I know well that it was no common ability that he brought to bear on mathematics, and that his industry was extraordinary. But, though many years have elapsed since Conon's death, I do not find that any one of the problems has been stirred by a single person. I wish now to put them in review one by one, particularly as it happens that there are two included among them which are impossible of realization [and which may serve as a warning] how those who claim to discover everything but produce no proofs of the same may be confuted as having actually pretended to discover the impossible.
>
> "What are the problems I mean, and what are those of which you have already received the proofs, and those of which the proofs are contained in this book respectively, I think it proper to specify. The first of the problems was, Given a sphere, to find a plane area equal to the surface of the sphere; and this was first made manifest on the publication of the book concerning the sphere, for, when it is once proved that the surface of any sphere is four times the greatest circle in the sphere, it is clear that it is possible to find a plane area equal to the surface of the sphere. The second was, Given a cone or a cylinder, to find a sphere equal to the cone or cylinder; the third, To cut a given sphere by a plane so that the segments of it have to one another an assigned ratio; the fourth, To cut a given sphere by a plane so that the segments of the surface have to one another an assigned ratio; the fifth, To make a given segment of a sphere similar to a given segment of a sphere;^1^ the sixth, Given two segments of either the same or different spheres, to find a segment of a sphere which shall be similar to one of the segments and have its surface equal to the surface of the other segment. The seventh was, From a given sphere to cut off a segment by a plane so that the segment bears to the cone which has the same base as the segment and equal height an assigned ratio greater than that of three to two. Of all the propositions just enumerated Heracleides brought you the proofs. The proposition stated next after these was wrong, viz. that, if a sphere be cut by a plane into unequal parts, the greater segment will have to the less the duplicate ratio of that which the greater surface has to the less. That this is wrong is obvious by what I sent you before; for it included this proposition: If a sphere be cut into unequal parts by a plane at right angles to any diameter in the sphere, the greater segment of the surface will have to the less the same ratio as the greater segment of the diameter has to the less, while the greater segment of the sphere has to the less a ratio less than the duplicate ratio of that which the greater surface has to the less, but greater than the sesqui-alterate^2^ of that ratio. The last of the problems was also wrong, viz. that, if the diameter of any sphere be cut so that the square on the greater segment is triple of the square on the lesser segment, and if through the point thus arrived at, a plane be drawn at right angles to the diameter and cutting the sphere, the figure in such a form as is the greater segment of the sphere is the greatest of all the segments which have an equal surface. That this is wrong is also clear from the theorems which I before sent you. For it was there proved that the hemisphere is the greatest of all the segments of a sphere bounded by an equal surface.
>
> "After these theorems the following were propounded concerning the cone.^3^ If a section of a right-angled cone [a parabola], in which the diameter [axis] remains fixed, be made to revolve so that the diameter [axis] is the axis [of revolution], let the figure described by the section of the right-angled cone be called a conoid. And if a plane touch the conoidal figure and another plane drawn parallel to the tangent plane cut off a segment of the conoid, let the base of the segment cut off be defined as the cutting plane, and the vertex as the point in which the other plane touches the conoid. Now, if the said figure be cut by a plane at right angles to the axis, it is clear that the section will be a circle; but it needs to be proved that the segment cut off will be half as large again as the cone which has the same base as the segment and equal height. And if two segments be cut off from the conoid by planes drawn in any manner, it is clear that the sections will be sections of acute-angled cones [ellipses] if the cutting planes be not at right angles to the axis; but it needs to be proved that the segments will bear to one another the ratio of the squares on the lines drawn from their vertices parallel to the axis to meet the cutting planes. The proofs of these propositions are not yet sent to you.
>
> "After these came the following propositions about the spiral, which are as it were another sort of problem having nothing in common with the foregoing; and I have written out the proofs of them for you in this book. They are as follows. If a straight line of which one extremity remains fixed be made to revolve at a uniform rate in a plane until it returns to the position from which it started, and if, at the same time as the straight line revolves, a point move at a uniform rate along the straight line, starting from the fixed extremity, the point will describe a spiral in the plane. I say then that the area bounded by the spiral and the straight line which has returned to the position from which it started is a third part of the circle described with the fixed point as centre and with radius the length traversed by the point along the straight line during the one revolution. And, if a straight line touch the spiral at the extreme end of the spiral, and another straight line be drawn at right angles to the line which has revolved and resumed its position from the fixed extremity of it, so as to meet the tangent, I say that the straight line so drawn to meet it is equal to the circumference of the circle. Again, if the revolving line and the point moving along it make several revolutions and return to the position from which the straight line started, I say that the area added by the spiral in the third revolution will be double of that added in the second, that in the fourth three times, that in the fifth four times, and generally the areas added in the later revolutions will be multiples of that added in the second revolution according to the successive numbers, while the area bounded by the spiral in the first revolution is a sixth part of that added in the second revolution. Also, if on the spiral described in one revolution two points be taken and straight lines be drawn joining them to the fixed extremity of the revolving line, and if two circles be drawn with the fixed point as centre and radii the lines drawn to the fixed extremity of the straight line, and the shorter of the two lines be produced, I say that (1) the area bounded by the circumference of the greater circle in the direction of (the part of) the spiral included between the straight lines, the spiral (itself) and the produced straight line will bear to (2) the area bounded by the circumference of the lesser circle, the same (part of the) spiral and the straight line joining their extremities the ratio which (3) the radius of the lesser circle together with two thirds of the excess of the radius of the greater circle over the radius of the lesser bears to (4) the radius of the lesser circle together with one third of the said excess.
>
> "The proofs then of these theorems and others relating to the spiral are given in the present book. Prefixed to them, after the manner usual in other geometrical works, are the propositions necessary to the proofs of them. And here too, as in the books previously published, I assume the following lemma, that, if there be (two) unequal lines or (two) unequal areas, the excess by which the greater exceeds the less can, by being [continually] added to itself, be made to exceed any given magnitude among those which are comparable with [it and with] one another."

## Proposition 1

If a point move at a uniform rate along any line, and two lengths be taken on it, they will be proportional to the times of describing them.

Two unequal lengths are taken on a straight line, and two lengths on another straight line representing the times; and they are proved to be proportional by taking equimultiples of each length and the corresponding time after the manner of *Eucl. V, Def. 5*.

## Proposition 2

If each of two points on different lines respectively move along them each at a uniform rate, and if lengths be taken, one on each line, forming pairs, such that each pair are described in equal times, the lengths will be proportionals.

This is proved at once by equating the ratio of the lengths taken on one line to that of the times of description, which must also be equal to the ratio of the lengths taken on the other line.

## Proposition 3

Given any number of circles, it is possible to find a straight line greater than the sum of all their circumferences.

For we have only to describe polygons about each and then take a straight line equal to the sum of the perimeters of the polygons.

## Proposition 4

Given two unequal lines, viz. a straight line and the circumference of a circle, it is possible to find a straight line less than the greater of the two lines and greater than the less.

For, by the Lemma, the excess can, by being added a sufficient number of times to itself, be made to exceed the lesser line.

Thus e.g., if $c > l$ (where $c$ is the circumference of the circle and $l$ the length of the straight line), we can find a number $n$ such that
$n(c - l) > l$.

Therefore
$c - l > l/n$,
and
$c > l + l/n > l$.

Hence we have only to divide $l$ into $n$ equal parts and add one of them to $l$. The resulting line will satisfy the condition.

## Proposition 5

Given a circle with centre O, and the tangent to it at a point A, it is possible to draw from O a straight line OPF, meeting the circle in P and the tangent in F, such that, if $c$ be the circumference of any given circle whatever,
$FP : OP < (\text{arc AP}) : c$.

Take a straight line, as D, greater than the circumference $c$. [Prop. 3]

Through O draw OH parallel to the given tangent, and draw through A a line APH, meeting the circle in P and OH in H, such that the portion PH intercepted between the circle and the line OH may be equal to D. Join OP and produce it to meet the tangent in F.

Then $FP : OP = AP : PH$, by parallels,
$= AP : D$
$< (\text{arc AP}) : c$.

## Proposition 6

Given a circle with centre O, a chord AB less than the diameter, and OM the perpendicular on AB from O, it is possible to draw a straight line OFP, meeting the chord AB in F and the circle in P, such that
$FP : PB = D : E$,
where $D : E$ is any given ratio less than $BM : MO$.

Draw OH parallel to AB, and BT perpendicular to BO meeting OH in T.

Then the triangles BMO, OBT are similar, and therefore
$BM : MO = OB : BT$,
whence $D : E < OB : BT$.

Suppose that a line PH (greater than BT) is taken such that
$D : E = OB : PH$,
and let PH be so placed that it passes through B and P lies on the circumference of the circle, while H is on the line OH. (PH will fall outside BT, because $PH > BT$.)

Join OP meeting AB in F.

We now have
$FP : PB = OP : PH$
$= OB : PH$
$= D : E$.

## Proposition 7

Given a circle with centre O, a chord AB less than the diameter, and OM the perpendicular on it from O, it is possible to draw from O a straight line OPF, meeting the circle in P and AB produced in F, such that
$FP : PB = D : E$,
where $D : E$ is any given ratio greater than $BM : MO$.

Draw OT parallel to AB, and BT perpendicular to BO meeting OT in T.

In this case,
$D : E > BM : MO$
$> OB : BT$, by similar triangles.

Take a line PH (less than BT) such that
$D : E = OB : PH$,
and place PH so that P, H are on the circle and on OT respectively, while HP produced passes through B.

Then $FP : PB = OP : PH$
$= D : E$.

## Proposition 8

Given a circle with centre O, a chord AB less than the diameter, the tangent at B, and the perpendicular OM from O on AB, it is possible to draw from O a straight line OFP, meeting the chord AB in F, the circle in P and the tangent in G, such that
$FP : BG = D : E$,
where $D : E$ is any given ratio less than $BM : MO$.

If OT be drawn parallel to AB meeting the tangent at B in T,
$BM : MO = OB : BT$,
so that $D : E < OB : BT$.

Take a point C on TB produced such that
$D : E = OB : BC$,
whence $BC > BT$.

Through the points O, T, C describe a circle, and let OB be produced to meet this circle in K.

Then, since $BC > BT$, and OB is perpendicular to CT, it is possible to draw from O a straight line OGQ, meeting CT in G and the circle about OTC in Q, such that $GQ = BK$.

Let OGQ meet AB in F and the original circle in P.

Now $CG \cdot GT = OG \cdot GQ$;
and $OF : OG = BT : GT$,
so that $OF \cdot GT = OG \cdot BT$.

It follows that
$CG \cdot GT : OF \cdot GT = OG \cdot GQ : OG \cdot BT$,
or $CG : OF = GQ : BT$
$= BK : BT$, by construction,
$= BC : OP$.

Hence $OP : OF = BC : CG$,
and therefore $PF : OP = BG : BC$,
or $PF : BG = OP : BC$
$= OB : BC$
$= D : E$.

## Proposition 9

Given a circle with centre O, a chord AB less than the diameter, the tangent at B, and the perpendicular OM from O on AB, it is possible to draw from O a straight line OPGF, meeting the circle in P, the tangent in G, and AB produced in F, such that
$FP : BG = D : E$,
where $D : E$ is any given ratio greater than $BM : MO$.

Let OT be drawn parallel to AB meeting the tangent at B in T.
Then
$D : E > BM : MO$
$> OB : BT$, by similar triangles.

Produce TB to C so that
$D : E = OB : BC$,
whence $BC < BT$.

Describe a circle through the points O, T, C, and produce OB to meet this circle in K.

Then, since $TB > BC$, and OB is perpendicular to CT, it is possible to draw from O a line OGQ, meeting CT in G, and the circle about OTC in Q, such that $GQ = BK$. Let OQ meet the original circle in P and AB produced in F.

We now prove, exactly as in the last proposition, that
$CG : OF = BK : BT$
$= BC : OP$.

Thus, as before,
$OP : OF = BC : CG$,
and $OP : PF = BC : BG$,
whence $PF : BG = OP : BC$
$= OB : BC$
$= D : E$.

## Proposition 10

If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots A_n$ be $n$ lines forming an ascending arithmetical progression in which the common difference is equal to $A_1$, the least term, then
$(n+1)A_n^2 + A_1(A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n) = 3(A_1^2 + A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$.

[Archimedes’ proof of this proposition is given above, pp. 456-7, and it is there pointed out that the result is equivalent to
$1^2+2^2+3^2 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.]

Cor. 1. It follows from this proposition that
$n \cdot A_n^2 < 3(A_1^2+A_2^2 + \dots + A_n^2)$,
and also that
$n \cdot A_n^2 > 3(A_1^2+A_2^2 + \dots + A_{n-1}^2)$.

[For the proof of the latter inequality see p. 457 above.]

Cor. 2. All the results will equally hold if similar figures are substituted for squares.

## Proposition 11

If $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ be $n$ lines forming an ascending arithmetical progression [in which the common difference is equal to the least term $A_1$], then
$(n-1)A_n^2 : (A_n^2+A_{n-1}^2 + \dots + A_2^2) < A_n^2 : \{A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(A_n-A_1)^2\}$;
but
$(n-1)A_n^2 : (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2) > A_n^2 : \{A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(A_n-A_1)^2\}$.

[Archimedes sets out the terms side by side in the manner shown in the figure, where $BC = A_n$, $DE = A_{n-1}, \dots RS = A_1$, and produces $DE, FG, \dots RS$ until they are respectively equal to $BC$ or $A_n$, so that $EH, GI, \dots SU$ in the figure are respectively equal to $A_1, A_2 \dots A_{n-1}$. He further measures lengths $BK, DL, FM, \dots PV$ along $BC, DE, FG, \dots PQ$ respectively each equal to $RS$.

The figure makes the relations between the terms easier to see with the eye, but the use of so large a number of letters makes the proof somewhat difficult to follow, and it may be more clearly represented as follows.]

It is evident that $(A_n - A_1) = A_{n-1}$.

The following proportion is therefore obviously true, viz.
$(n-1)A_n^2 : (n-1)(A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}A_{n-1}^2) = A_n^2 : \{A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(A_n-A_1)^2\}$;

In order therefore to prove the desired result, we have only to show that
$(n-1)A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 < (A_n^2+A_{n-1}^2 + \dots + A_2^2)$
but $> (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$.

I. To prove the first inequality, we have
$(n-1)A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2$
$= (n-1)A_1^2 + (n-1)A_1 \cdot A_{n-1} + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2$. (1)

And
$A_n^2+A_{n-1}^2 + \dots + A_2^2 = (A_{n-1}+A_1)^2+(A_{n-2}+A_1)^2 + \dots + (A_1+A_1)^2$
$= (A_{n-1}^2 + A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ 2A_1(A_{n-1}+A_{n-2} + \dots + A_1)$
$= (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ A_1\{A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}+A_{n-3} + \dots + A_1$
$+ A_1+A_2 + \dots + A_{n-2}+A_{n-1}\}$
$= (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ nA_1 \cdot A_{n-1}$. (2)

Comparing the right-hand sides of (1) and (2), we see that $(n-1)A_1^2$ is common to both sides, and
$(n-1)A_1 \cdot A_{n-1} < nA_1 \cdot A_{n-1}$,
while, by Prop. 10, Cor. 1,
$\frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 < A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2$.

It follows therefore that
$(n-1)A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 < (A_n^2+A_{n-1}^2 + \dots + A_2^2)$;
and hence the first part of the proposition is proved.

II. We have now, in order to prove the second result, to show that
$(n-1)A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 > (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$.

The right-hand side is equal to
$(A_{n-2}+A_1)^2+(A_{n-3}+A_1)^2 + \dots + (A_1+A_1)^2+A_1^2$
$= A_{n-2}^2+A_{n-3}^2 + \dots + A_1^2$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ 2A_1(A_{n-2}+A_{n-3} + \dots + A_1)$
$= (A_{n-2}^2+A_{n-3}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ A_1\{A_{n-2}+A_{n-3} + \dots + A_1$
$+ A_1+A_2 + \dots + A_{n-2}\}$
$= (A_{n-2}^2+A_{n-3}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$
$+ (n-1)A_1^2$
$+ (n-2)A_1 \cdot A_{n-1}$. (3)

Comparing this expression with the right-hand side of (1) above, we see that $(n-1)A_1^2$ is common to both sides, and
$(n-1)A_1 \cdot A_{n-1} > (n-2)A_1 \cdot A_{n-1}$,
while, by Prop. 10, Cor. 1,
$\frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 > (A_{n-2}^2 + A_{n-3}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$.

Hence $(n-1)A_n \cdot A_1 + \frac{1}{3}(n-1)A_{n-1}^2 > (A_{n-1}^2+A_{n-2}^2 + \dots + A_1^2)$;
and the second required result follows.

Cor. The results in the above proposition are equally true if similar figures be substituted for squares on the several lines.

## DEFINITIONS

1.  If a straight line drawn in a plane revolve at a uniform rate about one extremity which remains fixed and return to the position from which it started, and if, at the same time as the line revolves, a point move at a uniform rate along the straight line beginning from the extremity which remains fixed, the point will describe a spiral (*helix*, ἕλιξ) in the plane.
2.  Let the extremity of the straight line which remains fixed while the straight line revolves be called the origin of the spiral.
3.  And let the position of the line from which the straight line began to revolve be called the initial line in the revolution.
4.  Let the length which the point that moves along the straight line describes in one revolution be called the *first distance*, that which the same point describes in the second revolution the *second distance*, and similarly let the distances described in further revolutions be called after the number of the particular revolution.
5.  Let the area bounded by the spiral described in the first revolution and the first distance be called the *first area*, that bounded by the spiral described in the second revolution and the second distance the *second area*, and similarly for the rest in order.
6.  If from the origin of the spiral any straight line be drawn, let that side of it which is in the same direction as that of the revolution be called forward (*proagomena*, προαγόμενα), and that which is in the other direction backward (*episogomena*, ἐπισογόμενα).
7.  Let the circle drawn with the origin as centre and the first distance as radius be called the *first circle*, that drawn with the same centre and twice the radius the *second circle*, and similarly for the succeeding circles.

## Proposition 12

If any number of straight lines drawn from the origin to meet the spiral make equal angles with one another, the lines will be in arithmetical progression.

[The proof is obvious.]

## Proposition 13

If a straight line touch the spiral, it will touch it in one point only.

Let O be the origin of the spiral, and BC a tangent to it.

If possible, let BC touch the spiral in two points P, Q. Join OP, OQ, and bisect the angle POQ by the straight line OR meeting the spiral in R.

Then [Prop. 12] OR is an arithmetic mean between OP and OQ, or
$OP+OQ = 2OR$.

But in any triangle POQ, if the bisector of the angle POQ meets PQ in K,
$OP+OQ > 2OK$.

Therefore $OK < OR$, and it follows that some point on BC between P and Q lies within the spiral. Hence BC cuts the spiral; which is contrary to the hypothesis.

## Proposition 14

If O be the origin, and P, Q two points on the first turn of the spiral, and if OP, OQ produced meet the “first circle” AKP'Q' in P', Q' respectively, OA being the initial line, then
$OP : OQ = (\text{arc AKP'}) : (\text{arc AKQ'})$.

For, while the revolving line OA moves about O, the point A on it moves uniformly along the circumference of the circle AKP'Q', and at the same time the point describing the spiral moves uniformly along OA.

Thus, while A describes the arc AKP', the moving point on OA describes the length OP, and, while A describes the arc AKQ', the moving point on OA describes the distance OQ.

Hence
$OP : OQ = (\text{arc AKP'}) : (\text{arc AKQ'})$. [Prop. 2]

## Proposition 15

If P, Q be points on the second turn of the spiral, and OP, OQ meet the “first circle” AKP'Q' in P', Q', as in the last proposition, and if $c$ be the circumference of the “first circle,” then
$OP : OQ = c + (\text{arc AKP'}) : c + (\text{arc AKQ'})$.

For, while the moving point on OA describes the distance OP, the point A describes the whole of the circumference of the “first circle” together with the arc AKP'; and, while the moving point on OA describes the distance OQ, the point A describes the whole circumference of the “first circle” together with the arc AKQ'.

Cor. Similarly, if P, Q are on the $n$th turn of the spiral,
$OP : OQ = (n-1)c+(\text{arc AKP'}) : (n-1)c+(\text{arc AKQ'})$.

## Propositions 16, 17

I. If BC be the tangent at P, any point on the spiral, PC being the “forward” part of BC, and if OP be joined, the angle OPC is obtuse while the angle OPB is acute.

I. Suppose P to be on the first turn of the spiral.

Let OA be the initial line, AKP' the “first circle.” Draw the circle DLP with centre O and radius OP, meeting OA in D. This circle must then, in the “forward” direction from P, fall within the spiral, and in the “backward” direction outside it, since the radii vectores of the spiral are on the “forward side” greater, and on the “backward” side less, than OP. Hence the angle OPC cannot be acute, since it cannot be less than the angle between OP and the tangent to the circle at P, which is a right angle.

It only remains therefore to prove that OPC is not a right angle.

If possible, let it be a right angle. BC will then touch the circle at P.

Therefore [Prop. 5] it is possible to draw a line OQC meeting the circle through P in Q and BC in C, such that
$CQ : OQ < (\text{arc PQ}) : (\text{arc DLP})$. (1)

Suppose that OC meets the spiral in R and the “first circle” in R'; and produce OP to meet the “first circle” in P'.

From (1) it follows, componendo, that
$CO : OQ < (\text{arc DLQ}) : (\text{arc DLP})$
$< (\text{arc AKR'}) : (\text{arc AKP'})$
$< OR : OP$. [Prop. 14]

But this is impossible, because $OQ = OP$,
and $OR < OC$.

Hence the angle OPC is not a right angle. It was also proved not to be acute.

Therefore the angle OPC is obtuse, and the angle OPB consequently acute.

II. If P is on the second, or the $n$th turn, the proof is the same, except that in the proportion (1) above we have to substitute for the arc DLP an arc equal to $(p+\text{arc DLP})$ or $(n-1)p+\text{arc DLP}$, where $p$ is the perimeter of the circle DLP through P. Similarly, in the later steps, $p$ or $(n-1)p$ will be added to each of the arcs DLQ and DLP, and $c$ or $(n-1)c$ to each of the arcs AKR', AKP', where $c$ is the circumference of the “first circle” AKP'.

## Propositions 18, 19

I. If OA be the initial line, A the end of the first turn of the spiral, and if the tangent to the spiral at A be drawn, the straight line OB drawn from O perpendicular to OA will meet the said tangent in some point B, and OB will be equal to the circumference of the “first circle.”

II. If A' be the end of the second turn, the perpendicular OB will meet the tangent at A' in some point B', and OB' will be equal to 2 (circumference of “second circle”).

III. Generally, if $A_n$ be the end of the $n$th turn, and OB meet the tangent at $A_n$ in $B_n$, then $OB_n = n \cdot c_n$,
where $c_n$ is the circumference of the “$n$th circle.”

I. Let AKC be the “first circle.” Then, since the “backward” angle between OA and the tangent at A is acute [Prop. 16], the tangent will meet the “first circle” in a second point C. And the angles CAO, BOA are together less than two right angles; therefore OB will meet AC produced in some point B.

Then, if $c$ be the circumference of the first circle, we have to prove that
$OB = c$.

If not, OB must be either greater or less than $c$.

(1) If possible, suppose $OB > c$.

Measure along OB a length OD less than OB but greater than $c$.

We have then a circle AKC, a chord AC in it less than the diameter, and a ratio AO : OD which is greater than the ratio AO : OB or (what is, by similar

# ON SPIRALS

triangles, equal to it) the ratio of AC to the perpendicular from O on AC. Therefore [Prop. 7] we can draw a straight line OFF, meeting the circle in P and CA produced in F, such that

FP : PA = AO : OD.

Thus, alternately, since AO = PO,

FP : PO = PA : OD

< (arc PA) : c,

since (arc PA) > PA, and OD > c.

Componendo,

FO : PO < (c + arc PA) : c
< OQ : OA,

where OF meets the spiral in Q. [Prop. 15]

Therefore, since OA = OP, FO < OQ; which is impossible.

Hence OD > c.

(2) If possible, suppose OB < c.

Measure OE along OB so that OE is greater than OB but less than c.

In this case, since the ratio AO : OE is less than the ratio AO : OB (or the ratio of AC to the perpendicular from O on AC), we can [Prop. 8] draw a line OFF'P'G, meeting AC in F', the circle in P', and the tangent at A to the circle in G, such that

F'P' : AG = A'O : OE.

Let OP'G cut the spiral in Q'.

Then we have, alternately,

F'P' : P'O = AG : OE

> (arc AP') : c,

because AG > (arc AP'), and OE < c.

Therefore

F'O : P'O < (arc AP') : c

< OQ' : OA'. [Prop. 14]

But this is impossible, since OA' = OP', and OQ' < OF'.

Hence OB' < c.

Since therefore OB is neither greater nor less than c,

OB = c.

II. Let A'K'C' be the “second circle,” A'C' being the tangent to the spiral at A' (which will cut the second circle, since the “backward” angle OA'C' is acute). Thus, as before, the perpendicular OB' to OA' will meet A'C' produced in some point B'.

If then c' is the circumference of the “second circle,” we have to prove that

OB' = 2c'.

For, if not, OB' must be either greater or less than 2c'.

(1) If possible, suppose OB' > 2c'.

Measure OD' along OB' so that OD' is less than OB' but greater than 2c'. Then, as in the case of the “first circle” above, we can draw a straight line OPF meeting the “second circle” in P and C'A' produced in F, such that

FP : PA' = A'O : OD'.

Let OF meet the spiral in Q.

We now have, since A'O = P O,

FP : PO = PA' : OD'

< (arc A'P) : 2c',

because (arc A'P) > PA' and OD' > 2c'.

Therefore FO : PO < (2c' + arc A'P) : 2c'

< OQ : OA'. [Prop. 15, Cor.]

Hence FO < OQ; which is impossible.

Thus OB' > 2c'.

Similarly, as in the case of the “first circle,” we can prove that

OB' < 2c'.

Therefore OB' = 2c'.

III. Proceeding, in like manner, to the “third” and succeeding circles, we shall prove that

OB_n = n c_n.

---

## Proposition 20

I. If P be any point on the first turn of the spiral and OT be drawn perpendicular to OP, OT will meet the tangent at P to the spiral in some point T; and, if the circle drawn with centre O and radius OP meet the initial line in K, then OT is equal to the arc of this circle between K and P measured in the *forward* direction of the spiral.

II. Generally, if P be a point on the nth turn, and the notation be as before, where p represents the circumference of the circle with radius OP,

OT = (n − 1)p + arc KP (measured “forward”).

I. Let P be a point on the first turn of the spiral, OA the initial line, PR the tangent at P taken in the *backward* direction.

Then [Prop. 16] the angle OPR is acute. Therefore PR meets the circle through P in some point P', and also OT will meet PR produced in some point P''.

If now OP is not equal to the arc KRP, it must be either greater or less.

(1) If possible, let OP be greater than the arc KRP.

Measure OU along OT less than OP but greater than the arc KRP.

Then, since the ratio PO : OU is greater than the ratio PO : OP, or (what is, by similar triangles, equal to it) the ratio of PP' to the perpendicular from O on PR, we can draw a line OQF, meeting the circle in Q and RP produced in F, such that

FQ : PQ = PO : OU. [Prop. 7]

Let OF meet the spiral in Q'.

We have then

FQ : QO = PQ : OU

< (arc PQ) : (arc KRP), by hypothesis.

Componendo,

FO : QO < (arc KRQ) : (arc KRP)

< OQ' : OP. [Prop. 14]

But QO = OP.

Therefore FO < OQ', which is impossible.

Hence OP > (arc KRP).

(2) The proof that OP < (arc KRP) follows the method of Prop. 18, I. (2), exactly as the above follows that of Prop. 18, I. (1).

Since then OP is neither greater nor less than the arc KRP, it is equal to it.

II. If P be on the second turn, the same method shows that

OP = p + (arc KRP);

and, similarly, we have, for a point P on the nth turn,

OP = (n − 1)p + (arc KRP).

---

## Propositions 21, 22, 23

Given an area bounded by any arc of a spiral and the lines joining the extremities of the arc to the origin, it is possible to circumscribe about the area one figure, and to inscribe in it another figure, each consisting of similar sectors of circles, and such that the circumscribed figure exceeds the inscribed by less than any assigned area.

For let BC be any arc of the spiral, O the origin. Draw the circle with centre O and radius OC, where C is the *forward* end of the arc.

Then, by bisecting the angle BOC, bisecting the resulting angles, and so on continually, we shall ultimately arrive at an angle COR cutting off a sector of the circle less than any assigned area. Let COR be this sector.

Let the other lines dividing the angle BOC into equal parts meet the spiral in P, Q, and let OR meet it in R. With O as centre and radii OP, OQ, OR respectively, describe arcs of circles Pp', Qq', QR r', each meeting the adjacent radii as shown in the figure. In each case the arc in the *forward* direction from each point will fall within, and the arc in the *backward* direction outside, the spiral.

We have now a circumscribed figure and an inscribed figure each consisting of similar sectors of circles. To compare their areas, we take the successive sectors of each, beginning from O, and compare them.

The sector OCR in the circumscribed figure stands alone.

And (sector ORq) − (sector ORc') = (sector OQr'),
(sector OQp) = (sector OQr'),
(sector OPb) = (sector OPq'),
while the sector OPp' in the inscribed figure stands alone.

Hence, if the equal sectors be taken away, the difference between the circumscribed and inscribed figures is equal to the difference between the sectors OCr and OPp', and this difference is less than the sector OCr, which is itself less than any assigned area.

The proof is exactly the same whatever be the number of angles into which the angle BOC is divided, the only difference being that, when the arc begins from the origin, the smallest sectors OPb, OPq' in each figure are equal, and there is therefore no inscribed sector standing by itself, so that the difference between the circumscribed and inscribed figures is equal to the sector OCr itself.

Thus the proposition is universally true.

Corollary. Since the area bounded by the spiral is intermediate in magnitude between the circumscribed and inscribed figures, it follows that

1. a figure can be circumscribed to the area such that it exceeds the area by less than any assigned space;

2. a figure can be inscribed such that the area exceeds it by less than any assigned space.

---

## Proposition 24

The area bounded by the first turn of the spiral and the initial line is equal to one-third of the *first circle* (where Ci denotes the area of the first circle and the spiral is r = aθ, so that Ci = π(2πa)^2).

[The same proof shows equally that, if OP be any radius vector in the first turn of the spiral, the area of the portion of the spiral bounded thereby is equal to one-third of that sector of the circle drawn with radius OP which is bounded by the initial line and OP, measured in the *forward* direction from the initial line.]

Let O be the origin, OA the initial line, A the extremity of the first turn. Draw the “first circle,” i.e. the circle with O as centre and OA as radius.

Then, if Ci be the area of the first circle, Ri that of the first turn of the spiral bounded by OA, we have to prove that

Ri = (1/3) Ci.

For, if not, Ri must be either greater or less than (1/3)Ci.

I. Suppose, if possible, Ri < (1/3)Ci.

We can then circumscribe a figure about Ri made up of similar sectors of circles such that, if F be the area of this figure,

F − Ri < (1/3)Ci − Ri,

whence F < (1/3)Ci.

Let OP, OQ, ... be the radii of the circular sectors, beginning from the smallest. The radius of the largest is of course OA.

The radii then form an ascending arithmetical progression in which the common difference is equal to the least term OP. If n be the number of the sectors, we have [by Prop. 10, Cor. 1]

n · OA^2 < 3(OP^2 + OQ^2 + ... + OA^2);

and, since the similar sectors are proportional to the squares on their radii, it follows that

Ci < 3F,

or F > (1/3)Ci.

But this is impossible, since F was less than (1/3)Ci.

Therefore Ri is not less than (1/3)Ci.

II. Suppose, if possible, Ri > (1/3)Ci.

We can then inscribe a figure made up of similar sectors of circles such that, if f be its area,

Ri − f < Ri − (1/3)Ci,

whence f > (1/3)Ci.

If there are (n − 1) sectors, their radii, as OP, OQ, ..., form an ascending arithmetical progression in which the least term is equal to the common difference, and the greatest term, as OY, is equal to (n − 1)OP.

Thus [Prop. 10, Cor. 1]

n · OA^2 > 3(OP^2 + OQ^2 + ... + OY^2),

whence Ci > 3f,

or f < (1/3)Ci;

which is impossible, since f > (1/3)Ci.

Therefore Ri is not greater than (1/3)Ci.

Since then Ri is neither greater nor less than (1/3)Ci,

Ri = (1/3)Ci.

---

## Propositions 25, 26, 27

[Prop. 25.] If A2 be the end of the second turn of the spiral, the area bounded by the second turn and OA2 is to the area of the “second circle” in the ratio of 7 to 12, being the ratio of {r2 r1 + (1/3)(r2 − r1)^2} to r2^2, where r1, r2 are the radii of the “first” and “second” circles respectively.

[Prop. 26.] If BC be any arc measured in the *forward* direction on any turn of a spiral, not being greater than the complete turn, and if a circle be drawn with O as centre and OC as radius meeting OB in B', then

(area of spiral between OB and OC) : (sector OB'C)
= {OC·OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : OC^2.

[Prop. 27.] If R1 be the area of the first turn of the spiral bounded by the initial line, R2 the area of the ring added by the second complete turn, R3 that of the ring added by the third turn, and so on, then

R3 = 2 R2, R4 = 3 R2, R5 = 4 R2, ..., Rn = (n − 1)R2.

Also R2 = 6 R1.

[Archimedes’ proof of Prop. 25 is, mutatis mutandis, the same as his proof of the more general Prop. 26. The latter will accordingly be given here, and applied to Prop. 25 as a particular case.]

Let BC be an arc measured in the *forward* direction on any turn of the spiral, CKB' the circle drawn with O as centre and OC as radius.

Take a circle such that the square of its radius is equal to

OC·OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2,

and let α be a sector in it whose central angle is equal to the angle BOC. Thus α : (sector OB'C) = {OC·OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : OC^2

and we have therefore to prove that

(area of spiral OBC) = α.

For, if not, the area of the spiral OBC (which we will call S) must be either greater or less than α.

I. Suppose, if possible, S < α.

Circumscribe to the area S a figure made up of similar sectors of circles, such that, if F be the area of the figure,

F − S < α − S,

F < α.

Let the radii of the successive sectors, starting from OB, be OP, OQ, ... , OC. Produce OP, OQ, ... to meet the circle CKB', ...

If then the lines OP, OP, OQ, ... OC be n in number, the number of sectors in the circumscribed figure will be (n − 1), and the sector OB'C will also be divided into (n − 1) equal sectors. Also OP, OP, OQ, ... OC will form an ascending arithmetical progression of n terms.

Therefore [see Prop. 11 and Cor.]

(n − 1) · OC^2 : (OP^2 + OQ^2 + ... + OC^2) < OC^2 : {OC·OP + (1/3)(OC − OP)^2}

< (sector OB'C) : α, by hypothesis.

Hence, since similar sectors are as the squares of their radii,

(sector OB'C) : F < (sector OB'C) : α,

so that F > α.

But this is impossible, because F < α.

Therefore S is not less than α.

II. Suppose, if possible, S > α.

Inscribe in the area S a figure made up of similar sectors of circles such that, if f be its area,

S − f < S − α,

whence f > α.

Suppose OP, OP, ... OF to be the radii of the successive sectors making up the figure f, being (n − 1) in number.

We shall have in this case [see Prop. 11 and Cor.]

(n − 1) OC^2 : (OP^2 + OP^2 + ... + OF^2) > OC^2 : {OC·OP + (1/3)(OC − OP)^2},

whence (sector OB'C) : f > (sector OB'C) : α,

so that f < α.

But this is impossible, because f > α.

Therefore S is not greater than α.

Since then S is neither greater nor less than α, it follows that

S = α.

In the particular case where P coincides with A1, the end of the first turn of the spiral, and O with A2, the end of the second turn, the sector OB'C becomes the complete “second circle,” that, namely, with OA2 (or r2) as radius.

Thus (area of spiral bounded by OA2) : (“second circle”)

= {r2 r1 + (1/3)(r2 − r1)^2} : r2^2
= (2 + 1/3) : 4 (since r2 = 2 r1)
= 7 : 12.

Again, the area of the spiral bounded by OA2 is equal to R1 + R2 (i.e. the area bounded by the first turn and OA1, together with the ring added by the second turn). Also the “second circle” is four times the “first circle,” and therefore equal to 4 Ci = 12 R1.

Hence (R1 + R2) : (12 R1) = 7 : 12,

or R1 + R2 = 7 R1.

Thus R2 = 6 R1. (1)

Next, for the third turn, we have

(R1 + R2 + R3) : (“third circle”) = {r3 r2 + (1/3)(r3 − r2)^2} : r3^2

= (3·2 + 1/3) : 9
= 19 : 27,

(“third circle”) = 9 ( “first circle” ) = 27 R1;

and therefore R1 + R2 + R3 = 19 R1;

and, by (1) above, it follows that

R3 = 2 R2. (2)

and so on.

Generally, we have

(R1 + R2 + ... + Rn) : (nth circle) = {rn r_{n−1} + (1/3)(rn − r_{n−1})^2} : rn^2,

(R1 + R2 + ... + R_{n−1}) : (n−1th circle) = {r_{n−1} r_{n−2} + (1/3)(r_{n−1} − r_{n−2})^2} : r_{n−1}^2,

and (nth circle) : (n−1th circle) = rn^2 : r_{n−1}^2.

Therefore

(R1 + R2 + ... + Rn) : (R1 + R2 + ... + R_{n−1})
= {3 n (n − 1) + 1} : {3 (n − 1)(n − 2) + 1}.

Dirimendo,

(Rn) : (R1 + R2 + ... + R_{n−1}) = 6(n − 1) : {3 (n − 1)(n − 2) + 1}. (a)

Similarly,

R_{n−1} : (R1 + R2 + ... + R_{n−2}) = 6(n − 2) : {3 (n − 2)(n − 3) + 1},

from which we derive

R_{n−1} : (R1 + R2 + ... + R_{n−1})
= 6(n − 2) : {3 (n − 1)(n − 2) + 1}. (b)

Combining (a) and (b), we obtain

Rn : R_{n−1} = (n − 1) : (n − 2).

Thus

R2, R3, ... , Rn are in the ratio of the successive numbers 1, 2, 3, ... , (n − 1).

---

## Proposition 28

If O be the origin and BC any arc measured in the *forward* direction on any turn of the spiral, let two circles be drawn (1) with centre O, and radius OB, meeting OC in C, and (2) with centre O and radius OC, meeting OB produced in B'. Then, if E denote the area bounded by the larger circular arc B'C, the line B'B and the spiral BC, while F denotes the area bounded by the smaller arc BC', the line CC' and the spiral BC,

E : F = {OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)} : {OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)}.

Let a denote the area of the lesser sector OBC'; then the larger sector OB'C is equal to a + F + E.

Thus [Prop. 26]

(a + F) : (a + F + 2E) =
{OC·OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : OC^2, (1)

whence

E : (a + F) = [OC·(OC − OB) − (1/3)(OC − OB)^2] : {OC − OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2}

= {OB(OC − OB) + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : {OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)}. (2)

Again

(a + F + E) : a = OC^2 : OB^2.

Therefore, by the first proportion above, ex aequo

(a + F) : F = {OC·OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : {OB(OC − OB) + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2}.

Combining this with (2) above, we obtain

E : F = {OB(OC − OB) + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2} : {OB(OC − OB) + (1/3)(OC − OB)^2}

= [OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)] : [OB + (1/3)(OC − OB)].

# ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF PLANES OR THE CENTRES OF GRAVITY OF PLANES

## BOOK ONE

“I postulate the following”:

1. “Equal weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights at unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the weight which is at the greater distance.”

2. “If, when weights at certain distances are in equilibrium, something be added to one of the weights, they are not in equilibrium but incline towards that weight to which the addition was made.”

3. “Similarly, if anything be taken away from one of the weights, they are not in equilibrium but incline towards the weight from which nothing was taken.”

4. “When equal and similar plane figures coincide if applied to one another, their centres of gravity similarly coincide.”

5. “In figures which are unequal but similar, the centres of gravity will be similarly situated. By points similarly situated in relation to similar figures I mean points such that, if straight lines be drawn from them to the equal angles, they make equal angles with the corresponding sides.”

6. “If magnitudes at certain distances be in equilibrium, (other) magnitudes equal to them will also be in equilibrium at the same distances.”

7. “In any figure whose perimeter is concave in (one and) the same direction the centre of gravity must be within the figure.”

---

## Proposition 1

Weights which balance at equal distances are equal.

For, if they are unequal, take away from the greater the difference between the two. The remainders will then not balance [Post. 3]; which is absurd.

Therefore the weights cannot be unequal.

---

## Proposition 2

Unequal weights at equal distances will not balance but will incline towards the greater weight.

For take away from the greater the difference between the two. The equal remainders will therefore balance [Post. 1]. Hence, if we add the difference again, the weights will not balance but incline towards the greater [Post. 2].

---

## Proposition 3

Unequal weights will balance at unequal distances, the greater weight being at the lesser distance.

Let A, B be two unequal weights (of which A is the greater) balancing about C at distances AC, BC respectively.

Then AC shall be less than BC.

For, if not, take away from A the weight (A − B). The remainders will then incline towards B [Post. 3]. But this is impossible, for (1) if AC = CB, the equal remainders will balance, or (2) if AC > CB, they will incline towards A at the greater distance [Post. 1].

Hence AC < CB.

Conversely, if the weights balance, and AC < CB, then A > B.

---

## Proposition 4

If two equal weights have not the same centre of gravity, the centre of gravity of both taken together is at the middle point of the line joining their centres of gravity.

[Proved from Prop. 3 by reductio ad absurdum.]

---

## Proposition 5

If three equal magnitudes have their centres of gravity on a straight line at equal distances, the centre of gravity of the system will coincide with that of the middle magnitude.

[This follows immediately from Prop. 4.]

Cor. 1. The same is true of any odd number of magnitudes if those which are at equal distances from the middle one are equal, while the distances between their centres of gravity are equal.

Cor. 2. If there be an even number of magnitudes with their centres of gravity situated at equal distances on one straight line, and if the two middle ones be equal, while those which are equidistant from them (on each side) are equal respectively, the centre of gravity of the system is the middle point of the line joining the centres of gravity of the two middle ones.

---

## Propositions 6, 7

Two magnitudes, whether commensurable [Prop. 6] or incommensurable [Prop. 7], balance at distances reciprocally proportional to the magnitudes.

I. Suppose the magnitudes A, B to be commensurable, and the points A', B' to be their centres of gravity. Let DE be a straight line so divided at C that

A : B = CE : DC.

We have then to prove that, if A be placed at E and B at D, C is the centre of gravity of the two taken together.

Since A and B are commensurable, so are DC, CE. Let N be a common measure of DC, CE. Make DH, DK each equal to CE, and EL (on CE produced) equal to CD. Then LH = CD, since DH = CE. Therefore LH and HK must each contain N an even number of times.

Take a magnitude ϕ such that ϕ is contained as many times in A as N is contained in LH, whence

A : ϕ = LH : N.

But B : A = CE : CD = HK : LH.

Hence, ex aequali, B : ϕ = HK : N, or ϕ is contained in B as many times as N is contained in HK.

Thus ϕ is a common measure of A, B.

Divide LH, HK into parts each equal to N, and A, B into parts each equal to ϕ. The parts of A will therefore be equal in number to those of LH, and the parts of B equal in number to those of HK. Place one of the parts of A at the middle point of each of the parts N of LH, and one of the parts of B at the middle point of each of the parts N of HK.

Then the centre of gravity of the parts of A placed at equal distances on LH will be at E, the middle point of LH [Prop. 5, Cor. 2], and the centre of gravity of the parts of B placed at equal distances along HK will be at D, the middle point of HK.

Thus we may suppose A itself applied at E, and B itself applied at D.

But the system formed by the parts ϕ of A and B together is a system of equal magnitudes even in number and placed at equal distances along LK. And, since LE = CD, and EC = DK, LC = CK, so that C is the middle point of LK. Therefore C is the centre of gravity of the system ranged along LK.

Therefore A acting at E and B acting at D balance about the point C.

II. Suppose the magnitudes to be incommensurable, and let them be (A + a) and B respectively. Let DE be a line divided at C so that

(A + a) : B = DC : CE.

Then, if (A + a) placed at E and B placed at D do not balance about C, (A + a) is either too great to balance B, or not great enough.

Suppose, if possible, that (A + a) is too great to balance B. Take from (A + a) a magnitude a smaller than the deduction which would make the remainder balance B, but such that the remainder A and the magnitude B are commensurable.

Then, since A, B are commensurable, and

A : B = DC : CE,

A and B will not balance [Prop. 6], but D will be depressed.

But this is impossible, since the deduction a was an insufficient deduction from (A + a) to produce equilibrium, so that E was still depressed.

Therefore (A + a) is not too great to balance B; and similarly it may be proved that B is not too great to balance (A + a).

Hence (A + a), B taken together have their centre of gravity at C.

---

## Proposition 8

If AB be a magnitude whose centre of gravity is C, and AD a part of it whose centre of gravity is F, then the centre of gravity of the remaining part will be a point G on FC produced such that

GC : CF = (AD) : (DE).

For, if the centre of gravity of the remainder (DE) be not G, let it be a point H. Then an absurdity follows at once from Props. 6, 7.

---

## Proposition 9

The centre of gravity of any parallelogram lies on the straight line joining the middle points of opposite sides.

Let ABCD be a parallelogram, and let EF join the middle points of the opposite sides AD, BC.

If the centre of gravity does not lie on EF, suppose it to be H, and draw HK parallel to AD or BC meeting EF in K.

Then it is possible, by bisecting ED, then bisecting the halves, and so on continually, to arrive at a length EL less than KH. Divide both AE and ED into parts each equal to EL, and through the points of division draw parallels to AB or CD.

We have then a number of equal and similar parallelograms, and, if any one be applied to any other, their centres of gravity coincide [Post. 4]. Thus we have an even number of equal magnitudes whose centres of gravity lie at equal distances along a straight line. And, since LE = CD, and EC = DK, LC = CK, so that C is the middle point of LK. Therefore C is the centre of gravity of the system ranged along LK.

But this is impossible, for H is outside the middle parallelograms.

Therefore the centre of gravity cannot but lie on EF.

---

## Proposition 10

The centre of gravity of a parallelogram is the point of intersection of its diagonals.

For, by the last proposition, the centre of gravity lies on each of the lines which bisect opposite sides. Therefore it is at the point of their intersection; and this is also the point of intersection of the diagonals.

Alternative proof.

Let ABCD be the given parallelogram, and BD a diagonal. Then the triangles ABD, CDB are equal and similar, so that [Post. 4], if one be applied to the other, their centres of gravity will fall one upon the other.

Suppose F to be the centre of gravity of the triangle ABD. Let G be the middle point of BD. Join FG and produce it to H, so that FG = GH.

If we then apply the triangle ABD to the triangle CDB so that AD falls on CB and AB on CD, the point F will fall on H.

But [by Post. 4] F will fall on the centre of gravity of CDB. Therefore H is the centre of gravity of CDB.

Hence, since F, H are the centres of gravity of the two equal triangles, the centre of gravity of the whole parallelogram is at the middle point of FH, i.e. at the middle point of BD, which is the intersection of the two diagonals.

---

## Proposition 11

If abc, ABC be two similar triangles, and g, G two points in them similarly situated with respect to them respectively, then, if g be the centre of gravity of the triangle abc, G must be the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC.

Suppose

ab : bc : ca = AB : BC : CA.

The proposition is proved by an obvious reductio ad absurdum.

For, if G be not the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC, suppose H to be its centre of gravity.

Post. 5 requires that g, H shall be similarly situated with respect to the triangles respectively; and this leads at once to the absurdity that the angles HAB, GAB are equal.

---

## Proposition 12

Given two similar triangles abc, ABC, and d, D the middle points of bc, BC respectively, then, if the centre of gravity of abc lie on ad, that of ABC will lie on AD.

Let g be the point on ad which is the centre of gravity of abc.

Take G on AD such that

ad : ag = AD : AG,

and join gb, gc, GB, GC.

Then, since the triangles are similar, and bd, BD are the halves of bc, BC respectively,

ab : bd = AB : BD,

and the angles abd, ABD are equal.

Therefore the triangles abd, ABD are similar, and

∠bad = ∠BAD.

Also ba : ad = BA : AD,

while, from above, ad : ag = AD : AG.

Therefore ba : ag = BA : AG, while the angles bag, BAG are equal.

Hence the triangles bag, BAG are similar, and

∠abg = ∠ABG.

And, since the angles abd, ABD are equal, it follows that

∠gbd = ∠GBD.

In exactly the same manner we prove that

∠gac = ∠GAC,
∠aeg = ∠ACG,
∠gcd = ∠GCD.

Therefore g, G are similarly situated with respect to the triangles respectively; whence [Prop. 11] G is the centre of gravity of ABC.

---

## Proposition 13

In any triangle the centre of gravity lies on the straight line joining any angle to the middle point of the opposite side.

Let ABC be a triangle and D the middle point of BC. Join AD. Then the centre of gravity shall be on AD.

For, if possible, let this not be the case, and let H be the centre of gravity.

Then, if we bisect DC, then bisect the halves, and so on, we shall at length arrive at a length, as DE, less than HI. Divide both BD and DC into lengths each equal to DE, and through the points of division draw lines each parallel to DA meeting BA and AC in points as K, L, M and N, P, Q respectively.

Join MN, LP, KQ, which...

lines will then be each parallel to BC.

We have now a series of parallelograms FQ, TP, SN, and AD bisects opposite sides in each. Thus the centre of gravity of each parallelogram lies on AD [Prop. 9], and therefore the centre of gravity of the figure made up of them all lies on AD.

Let the centre of gravity of all the parallelograms taken together be O. Join OH and produce it; also draw CV parallel to DA meeting OH produced in V. Now, if n be the number of parts into which AC is divided,

A ADC : (sum of triangles on AN, NP, ...) = AC^2 : (AN^2 + NP^2 + ...)
= n^2 : n
= n : 1
= AC : AN.

Similarly

A ABD : (sum of triangles on AM, ML, ...) = AB : AM.

And AC : AN = AB : AM.

It follows that

A ABC : (sum of all the small As) = CA : AN
= VO : OH, by parallels.

Suppose OV produced to X so that

A ABC : (sum of small As) = XO : OH,

whence, *dividendo*,

(sum of parallelograms) : (sum of small As) = XH : HO.

Since then the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC is at H, and the centre of gravity of the part of it made up of the parallelograms is at O, it follows from Prop. 8 that the centre of gravity of the remaining portion consisting of all the small triangles taken together is at X.

But this is impossible, since all the triangles are on one side of the line through X parallel to AD.

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangle cannot but lie on AD.

Draw HI parallel to CB meeting AD in I.

## Alternative Proof

Suppose, if possible, that H, not lying on AD, is the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC. Join AH, BH, CH. Let E, F be the middle points of CA, AB respectively, and join DE, EF, FD. Let EF meet AD in M.

Draw FK, EL parallel to AH meeting BH, CH in K, L respectively. Join KD, HD, LD, KL. Let KL meet DH in N, and join MN.

Since DE is parallel to AB, the triangles ABC, EDC are similar.

And, since CE = EA, and EL is parallel to AH, it follows that CL = LH. And CD = DB.

Therefore BH is parallel to DL.

Thus in the similar and similarly situated triangles ABC, EDC the straight lines AH, BH are respectively parallel to EL, DL; and it follows that H, L are similarly situated with respect to the triangles respectively.

But H is, by hypothesis, the centre of gravity of ABC. Therefore L is the centre of gravity of EDC. [Prop. 11]

Similarly the point K is the centre of gravity of the triangle FBD.

And the triangles FBD, EDC are equal, so that the centre of gravity of both together is at the middle point of KL, i.e. at the point N.

The remainder of the triangle ABC, after the triangles FBD, EDC are deducted, is the parallelogram AFDE, and the centre of gravity of this parallelogram is at M, the intersection of its diagonals.

It follows that the centre of gravity of the whole triangle ABC must lie on MN, that is, MN must pass through H, which is impossible (since MN is parallel to AH).

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangle ABC cannot but lie on AD.

## Proposition 14

It follows at once from the last proposition that the centre of gravity of any triangle is at the intersection of the lines drawn from any two angles to the middle points of the opposite sides respectively.

## Proposition 15

If AD, BC be the two parallel sides of a trapezium ABCD, AD being the smaller, and if AD, BC be bisected at E, F respectively, then the centre of gravity of the trapezium is at a point G on EF such that

GE : GF = (2BC + AD) : (2AD + BC).

Produce BA, CD to meet at O. Then FE produced will also pass through O, since AE = ED, and BF = FC.

Now the centre of gravity of the triangle OAD will lie on OE, and that of the triangle OBC will lie on OF. [Prop. 13]

It follows that the centre of gravity of the remainder, the trapezium ABCD, will also lie on OF. [Prop. 8]

Join BD, and divide it at L, M into three equal parts. Through L, M draw PQ, RS parallel to BC meeting BA in P, R, FE in W, V, and CD in Q, S respectively.

Join DF, BE meeting PQ in H and RS in K respectively.

Now, since BL = 1/3 BD,
FH = 1/3 FD.

Therefore H is the centre of gravity of the triangle DBC.

Similarly, since EK = 1/3 BE, it follows that K is the centre of gravity of the triangle ADB.

Therefore the centre of gravity of the triangles DBC, ADB together, i.e. of the trapezium, lies on the line HK.

But it also lies on OF.

Therefore, if OF, HK meet in G, G is the centre of gravity of the trapezium.

Hence [Props. 6, 7]

A DBC : A ABD = KG : GH
= VG : GW.

But A DBC : A ABD = BC : AD.

Therefore BC : AD = VG : GW.

It follows that

(2BC + AD) : (2AD + BC) = (2VG + GW) : (2GW + VG)
= EG : GF. *q.e.d.*
