# Volume 11 - Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Nicomachus

The masterworks of ancient Greek mathematics, covering geometry, arithmetic, and mathematical physics.

## EUCLID (fl. c. 300 B.C.)

The "Father of Geometry," Euclid compiled and systematized Greek mathematical knowledge into a comprehensive logical system.

- **The Elements** - The foundational treatise on geometry and number theory, presenting mathematics as a deductive system built from axioms

## ARCHIMEDES (c. 287-212 B.C.)

The greatest mathematician of antiquity, Archimedes made fundamental contributions to geometry, mechanics, and hydrostatics.

- **On the Sphere and Cylinder** - The surface area and volume of spheres and cylinders
- **Measurement of a Circle** - Approximation of pi and the area of a circle
- **On Conoids and Spheroids** - Volumes of solids of revolution
- **On Spirals** - Properties of the Archimedean spiral
- **On the Equilibrium of Planes** - The law of the lever and centers of gravity
- **Quadrature of the Parabola** - The area enclosed by a parabola
- **On Floating Bodies** - Hydrostatics and the principle of buoyancy
- **The Sand-Reckoner** - A system for expressing very large numbers
- **The Method** - How Archimedes discovered his theorems through mechanical reasoning
- **Book of Lemmas** - Collection of geometric propositions

## APOLLONIUS OF PERGA (c. 262-190 B.C.)

The "Great Geometer," Apollonius developed the definitive ancient treatment of conic sections.

- **On Conic Sections** - The properties of the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola

## NICOMACHUS OF GERASA (c. 60-120 A.D.)

A Neo-Pythagorean mathematician who wrote influential works on arithmetic.

- **Introduction to Arithmetic** - Number theory and the properties of numbers
