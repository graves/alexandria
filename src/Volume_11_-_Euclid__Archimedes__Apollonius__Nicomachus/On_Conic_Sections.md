## Biographical Note
Apollonius, c. 262 – c. 200 B.C.

Apollonius was born at *Perga* in *Pamphylia*, Asia Minor, some twenty-five years after the birth of *Archimedes*, which would place his birth around the year 262 B.C. He seems to have gone when quite young to *Alexandria*, where, according to *Pappus*, the fourth-century mathematician, he was attracted by the reputation of the astronomer, *Aristarchus of Samos*. Apollonius studied under the successors of *Euclid* at *Alexandria* and continued to reside there during the reigns of *Ptolemy Euergetes* and of *Ptolemy Philopator* (247-203 B.C.). He was also for some time in *Pergamum*, where he made the acquaintance of the mathematician, *Eudemus*, to whom he dedicated the first three books of his *Conics*, and of King *Attalus I* (269-197 B.C.), to whom the remaining five books of the *Conics* were dedicated.

Apollonius appears to have been associated with the leading mathematicians of his day. In the dedicatory epistles of the *Conics* he records that he met *Philonides* while on a trip to *Ephesus* and that he undertook the composition of this work in the first instance for *Naucrates*, who was staying in *Alexandria*. Speaking in the same place of the preceding writers on conics, Apollonius points out their limitations and inadequacies in such a way that some of his readers, such as *Pappus*, have considered him boastful and envious, but it would seem that Apollonius is only trying to explain the appearance of a new textbook on the elements of conics (Books I-IV) and the publication of his own original and more advanced investigations (Books V-VIII).

The *Conics* were at once recognized as the authoritative treatise on the subject, winning for their author the name of “the great geometer.” They are regularly cited by later writers. *Pappus* added a group of lemmas, and *Eutocius* (fl. 500 A.D.) edited and commented on the first four books. These books are extant in the original Greek; the fifth, sixth, and seventh books exist in an Arabic translation; the eighth book is known only indirectly.

Although the titles and a general indication of the contents of other works by Apollonius are given by later writers, especially by *Pappus*, only one, the *Cutting of a Ratio*, has survived, and that, like parts of the *Conics*, only in an Arabic version. All of the original work, with the exception of the second half of the *Conics*, has perished. Books not extant but known through *Pappus* are: *Cutting of an Area*, *Determinate Section*, *Tangencies*, *Inclinations*, and *Plane Loci*. He wrote on irrationals and, like *Archimedes*, devised a system of multiplication for counting large numbers and calculated an approximate value for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter. The ancient writers also record that Apollonius wrote *On the Burning-Glass*, in which he probably treated the properties of the parabola, a work comparing the dodecahedron and the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere, and a book, perhaps on the general principles of mathematics, in which he criticized and suggested improvements for *Euclid’s Elements*. Lastly, in astronomy he is credited by *Ptolemy* with an explanation of the motion of the planets by means of *epicycles* and *eccentric circles*. He seems to have been especially interested in the theory of the moon, and the *Alexandrians* are said to have called him *Epsilon* from the resemblance of that Greek letter to the lunar crescent.

## Translator’s Note

If on first appearance this treatise should seem to the reader a jumble of propositions, rigorous indeed, but without much rhyme or reason in their sequence, then he can be sure he has not read aright, and as with the planets, he must look further to save the appearances. There are one or two hypotheses at least that can order the apparent wanderings of parabolas, hyperbolas, and ellipses through the first four books. Such hypotheses are the analogies between the three sections, and especially the development of the analogy between the hyperbola and the ellipse reaching its culmination, in the first book, with the final theorem, the construction of *conjugate* opposite sections.

In First Definitions 1.5, Apollonius innocently defines two kinds of diameters, the transverse and the upright. Each one, in a conic section, bisects all the straight lines parallel to the other. But the upright diameter, defined here only as to position, has, in the case of the ellipse, natural bounds fixed by the section itself, and in Proposition I.15 we find it is the mean proportional between the corresponding transverse diameter (or conjugate diameter) and its parameter. The transverse diameter, in turn, is the mean proportional between the upright diameter (or conjugate) and its parameter, so “upright” and “transverse” become meaningless terms, in the case of the ellipse, for something better expressed by the symmetrical relation “conjugate” (First Def. 1.6). Immediately, in Proposition I.16, as if arbitrarily, the upright diameter of the hyperbola is bounded in the same way, given a definite magnitude, and becomes “the second diameter.” But so far transverse and upright diameters, or transverse and second diameters, are distinct things in the case of the hyperbola, and there seems to be little reason for giving this second diameter in magnitude; *nomos* has not yet become *physis*. That the upright diameter should be given even in position for the hyperbola becomes only very significant with two pairs of propositions—Propositions I.37 and I.38, and I.39 and I.40—where it is shown that certain properties holding for ordinates to the transverse diameter of the hyperbola and ellipse hold also for the ordinates to their conjugates. But it is only with the final proposition of the first book (I.60) that the magnitude of the hyperbola’s second diameter is justified in magnitude as well as position. It is the corresponding diameter of the opposite sections conjugate to the first. And this analogy between the hyperbola and ellipse now stands on the threshold of a vast development. For this theorem, coming as a climax to the first book, makes possible the main theme of the second book: the *asymptotes*, those strange lines all but touching each opposite section (II.2, II.13, II.14) and forming a single bound between each adjacent pair (II.15, II.17), so making the hyperbola an all but closed section, a puckered ellipse, a mouth turned inside out. And in the third book, the fruits of this analogy are gathered as in the especially nice case of Proposition III.15.

Although this translation is literal, we have not hesitated to use such symbols and abbreviations as, without prejudicing any Greek number theory or introducing any modern theory of symbols, would yet make the reading and the mechanic of study easier and at the same time preserve all the rigor of Greek mathematics.

As for the Greek text, we have used *Heiberg*, and have constantly referred to the *editio princeps* of *Halley*. In certain instances we have been glad to consult the very excellent French translation of *Paul Ver Eecke* (*Desclee de Brouwer*, *Bruges*, 1923). We have also deferred, at all relevant points, to the English usage of *T. L. Heath’s* translation of *Euclid’s Elements*.

## Book One

Apollonius to *Eudemus*, greetings.

If you are restored in body, and other things go with you to your mind, well and good; and we too fare pretty well. At the time I was with you in *Pergamum*, I observed you were quite eager to be kept informed of the work I was doing in conics. And so I have sent you this first book revised, and we shall dispatch the others when we are satisfied with them. For I don’t believe you have forgotten hearing from me how I worked out the plan for these conics at the request of *Naucrates*, the geometer, at the time he was with us in *Alexandria* lecturing, and how on arranging them in eight books we immediately communicated them in great haste because of his near departure, not revising them but putting down whatever came to us with the intention of a final going over. And so finding now the occasion of correcting them, one book after another, we publish them. And since it happened that some others among those frequenting us got acquainted with the first and second books before the revision, don’t be surprised if you come upon them in a different form.

Of the eight books the first four belong to a course in the elements. The first book contains the generation of the three sections and of the opposite branches, and the principal properties (*ta archika symptomata*) in them worked out more fully and universally than in the writings of others. The second book contains the properties (*ta sympiptonta*) having to do with the diameters and axes and also the asymptotes, and other things of a general and necessary use for limits of possibility (*pros tois diorismois*). And what I call diameters and what I call axes you will know from this book. The third book contains many incredible theorems of use for the construction of solid loci and for limits of possibility of which the greatest part and the most beautiful are new. And when we had grasped these, we knew that the three-line and four-line locus had not been constructed by *Euclid*, but only a chance part of it and that not very happily. For it was not possible for this construction to be completed without the additional things found by us. The fourth book shows in how many ways the sections of a cone intersect with each other and with the circumference of a circle, and contains other things in addition none of which has been written up by our predecessors, that is in how many points the section of a cone or the circumference of a circle and the opposite branches meet the opposite branches. The rest of the books are fuller in treatment. For there is one dealing more fully with maxima and minima, and one with equal and similar sections of a cone, and one with limiting theorems, and one with determinate conic problems. And so indeed, with all of them published, those happening upon them can judge them as they see fit. Good-bye.

## First Definitions

1.  If from a point a straight line is joined to the circumference of a circle which is not in the same plane with the point, and the line is produced in both directions, and if, with the point remaining fixed, the straight line being rotated about the circumference of the circle returns to the same place from which it began, then the generated surface composed of the two surfaces lying vertically opposite one another, each of which increases indefinitely as the generating straight line is produced indefinitely, I call a conic surface, and I call the fixed point the vertex, and the straight line drawn from the vertex to the center of the circle the axis.

2.  And the figure contained by the circle and by the conic surface between the vertex and the circumference of the circle I call a cone, and the point which is also the vertex of the surface I call the vertex of the cone, and the straight line drawn from the vertex to the center of the circle the axis, and the circle the base of the cone.

3.  I call right cones those having axes perpendicular to their bases, and oblique those not having axes perpendicular to their bases.

4.  Of any curved line which is in one plane I call that straight line the diameter which, drawn from the curved line, bisects all straight lines drawn to this curved line parallel to some straight line; and I call the end of that straight line (the diameter) situated on the curved line the vertex of the curved line, and I say that each of these parallels is drawn ordinatewise to the diameter (*tetagmenos epi ten diametron katechthai*).

    We shall follow modern usage and generally call these parallels ordinates.

5.  Likewise of any two curved lines lying in one plane I call that straight line the transverse diameter (*diametros plagia*) which cuts the two curved lines and bisects all the straight lines drawn to either of the curved lines parallel to some straight line; and I call the ends of the diameter situated on the curved lines the vertices of the curved lines; and I call that straight line the upright diameter (*diametros orthia*) which, lying between the two curved lines, bisects all the straight lines intercepted between the curved lines and drawn parallel to some straight line; and I say that each of the parallels is drawn ordinatewise to the diameter.

6.  The two straight lines each of which being a diameter bisects the straight lines parallel to the other I call the conjugate diameters (*syzygeis diametroi*) of a curved line and of two curved lines.

7.  And I call that straight line the axis of a curved line and of two curved lines which being a diameter of the curved line or lines cuts the parallel straight lines at right angles.

8.  And I call those straight lines the conjugate axes of a curved line and of two curved lines which being conjugate diameters cut the straight lines parallel to each other at right angles.

### Proposition 1

The straight lines drawn from the vertex of the conic surface to points on the surface are on that surface.

Let there be a conic surface whose vertex is the point A, and let there be taken some point B on the conic surface, and let a straight line ACB be joined. I say that the straight line ACB is on the conic surface.

For if possible, let it not be, and let the straight line DE be the line generating the surface, and EF be the circle along which ED is moved. Then if, the point A remaining fixed, the straight line DE is moved along the circumference of the circle EF, it will also go through the point B (Def. 1), and two straight lines will have the same ends. And this is absurd.

Therefore the straight line joined from A to B cannot not be on the surface. Therefore it is on the surface.

#### Porism

It is also evident that, if a straight line is joined from the vertex to some point among those within the surface, it will fall within the conic surface; and if it is joined to some point among those without, it will be outside the surface.

### Proposition 2

If on either one of the two vertically opposite surfaces two points are taken, and the straight line joining the points does not verge to the vertex, then it will fall within the surface, and produced it will fall outside.

Let there be a conic surface whose vertex is the point A and a circle BC along whose circumference the generating straight line is moved, and let two points D and E be taken on either one of the two vertically opposite surfaces, and let the joining straight line DE not verge to the point A.

I say that the straight line DE will be within the surface, and produced will be without.

Let AE and AD be joined and produced. Then they will fall on the circumference of the circle (I.1). Let them fall to the points B and C, and let BC be joined. Therefore the straight line BC will be within the circle, and so too within the conic surface.

Then let a point F be taken at random on DE, and let the straight line AF be joined and produced. Then it will fall on the straight line BC; for the triangle BCA is in one plane (Eucl. XI.2). Let it fall to the point G. Since then the point G is within the conic surface, therefore the straight line AG is also within the conic surface (I.1, porism), and so too the point F is within the conic surface. Then likewise it will be shown that all the points on the straight line DE are within the surface. Therefore the straight line DE is within the surface.

Then let DE be produced to H. I say then it will fall outside the conic surface.

For if possible, let there be some point H of it not outside the conic surface, and let AH be joined and produced. Then it will fall either on the circumference of the circle or within (I.1 and porism). And this is impossible, for it falls on BC produced, as for example to the point K. Therefore the straight line EH is outside the surface.

Therefore the straight line DE is within the conic surface, and produced is outside.

### Proposition 3

If a cone is cut by a plane through the vertex, the section is a triangle.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC; and let it be cut by some plane through the point A; and let it make, as sections, lines AB and AC on the surface, and the straight line BC in the base.

I say that ABC is a triangle.

For since the line joined from A to B is the common section of the cutting plane and of the surface of the cone, therefore AB is a straight line. And likewise also AC. And BC is also a straight line. Therefore ABC is a triangle.

If then a cone is cut by some plane through the vertex, the section is a triangle.

### Proposition 4

If either one of the vertically opposite surfaces is cut by some plane parallel to the circle along which the straight line generating the surface is moved, the plane cut off within the surface will be a circle having its center on the axis, and the figure contained by the circle and the conic surface intercepted by the cutting plane on the side of the vertex will be a cone.

Let there be a conic surface whose vertex is the point A and whose circle along which the straight line generating the surface is moved is BC; and let it be cut by some plane parallel to the circle BC, and let it make on the surface as a section the line DE.

I say that the line DE is a circle having its center on the axis.

For let the point F be taken as the center of the circle BC, and let AF be joined. Therefore AF is the axis (Def. 1) and meets the cutting plane. Let it meet it at the point G, and let some plane be produced through AF. Then the section will be the triangle ABC (I.3). And since the points D, G, E are points in the cutting plane, and are also in the plane of the triangle ABC, therefore DGE is a straight line (Eucl. XI.3).

Then let some point H be taken on the line DE, and let AH be joined and produced. Then it falls on the circumference BC (I.1). Let it meet it at K, and let GH and FK be joined. And since two parallel planes, DE and BC, are cut by a plane ABC, their common sections are parallel (Eucl. XI.16). Therefore the straight line DE is parallel to the straight line BC. Then for the same reason the straight line GH is also parallel to the straight line KF. Therefore FA : AG :: FB : DG :: FC : GE :: FK : GH (Eucl. VI.4).

And BF = KF = FC

Therefore also DG = GH = GE (Eucl. V.9).

Then likewise we could show also that all the straight lines falling from the point G on the line DE are equal to each other.

Therefore the line DE is a circle having its center on the axis.

And it is evident that the figure contained by the circle DE and the conic surface cut off by it on the side of the point A is a cone.

And it is therewith proved that the common section of the cutting plane and of the axial triangle (triangle through the axis) is a diameter of the circle.

### Proposition 5

If an oblique cone is cut by a plane through the axis at right angles to the base, and is also cut by another plane on the one hand at right angles to the axial triangle, and on the other cutting off on the side of the vertex a triangle similar to the axial triangle and lying subcontrariwise, then the section is a circle, and let such a section be called subcontrary.

Let there be an oblique cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through the axis perpendicular to the circle BC, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (I.3). Then let it also be cut by another plane perpendicular to the triangle ABC and cutting off on the side of the point A the triangle AKG similar to the triangle ABC and lying subcontrariwise, that is, so that the angle AKG is equal to the angle ABC. And let it make as a section on the surface, the line GHK.

I say that the line GHK is a circle.

For let any points H and L be taken on the lines GHK and BC, and from the points H and L let perpendiculars be dropped to the plane through the triangle ABC. Then they will fall to the common sections of the planes (Eucl. XI. def. 6). Let them fall as for example FH and LM. Therefore FH is parallel to LM (Eucl. XI.6).

Then let the straight line DFE be drawn through F parallel to BC; and FH is also parallel to LM. Therefore the plane through FH and DE is parallel to the base of the cone (Eucl. XI.15). Therefore it is a circle whose diameter is the straight line DE (I.4).

Therefore
`rect. DF, FE = sq. FH (Eucl. III.31 and VI.8, porism).`

And since ED is parallel to BC, angle ADE is equal to angle ABC. And angle AKG is supposed equal to angle ABC. And therefore angle AKG is equal to angle ADE. And the vertical angles at the point F are also equal. Therefore triangle DFG is similar to triangle KFE, and therefore EF : FK :: GF : FD (Eucl. VI.4).

Therefore
`rect. EF, FD = rect. KF, FG (Eucl. VI.16).`

But it has been shown that
`sq. FH = rect. EF, FD;`

and therefore
`rect. KF, FG = sq. FH.`

Likewise then all the perpendiculars drawn from the line GHK to the straight line GK could also be shown to be equal in square to the rectangle, in each case, contained by the segments of the straight line GK.

Therefore the section is a circle whose diameter is the straight line GK.

### Proposition 6

If a cone is cut by a plane through the axis, and some point is taken on the surface of the cone which is not on a side of the axial triangle, and from it is drawn a straight line parallel to some straight line which is a perpendicular from the circumference of the circle to the base of the triangle, then it meets the axial triangle, and on being produced to the other side of the surface it will be bisected by the triangle.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let the cone be cut by a plane through the axis, and let it make a common section the triangle ABC (I.3); and from some point M of those on the circumference, let the straight line MN be drawn perpendicular to the straight line BC. Then let some point D be taken on the surface of the cone, and through D let the straight line DE be drawn parallel to MN.

I say that the straight line DE produced will meet the plane of the triangle ABC, and, if further produced toward the other side of the cone until it meet its surface, will be bisected by the triangle ABC.

Let the straight line AD be joined and be produced. Therefore it will meet the circumference of the circle BC (I.1). Let it meet it at K and from K let the straight line KHL be drawn perpendicular to the straight line BC. Therefore KH is parallel to MN, and therefore to DE (Eucl. XI.9).

Let the straight line AH be joined from A to H. Since then in the triangle AHK the straight line DE is parallel to the straight line HK, therefore DE produced will meet AH. But AH is in the plane of ABC; therefore DE will meet the plane of the triangle ABC.

For the same reasons it also meets AH; let it meet it at F, and let DF be produced in a straight line until it meet the surface of the cone. Let it meet it at G.

I say that DF is equal to FG.

For since A, G, L are points on the surface of the cone, but also in the plane extended through the straight lines AH, AK, DG, KL, which is a triangle through the vertex of the cone (I.3), therefore A, G, L are points on the common section of the cone's surface and of the triangle. Therefore the line through A, G, L is a straight line. Since then in the triangle ALK the straight line DG has been drawn parallel to the base KHL and some straight line AFH has been drawn across them from the point A, therefore
`KH : HL :: DF : FG (Eucl. VI.2).`

But KH is equal to HL, since KL is a chord in circle BC perpendicular to the diameter (Eucl. III.3). Therefore DF is equal to FG.

### Proposition 7

If a cone is cut by a plane through the axis, and if it is also cut by another plane cutting the plane the base of the cone is in, in a straight line perpendicular either to the base of the axial triangle or to it produced, then the straight lines drawn from the resulting section on the cone’s surface, made by the cutting plane, parallel to the straight line perpendicular to the base of the triangle will fall on the common section of the cutting plane and of the axial triangle, and further produced to the other side of the section, are bisected by the common section; and if it is a right cone the straight line in the base will be perpendicular to the common section of the cutting plane and of the axial triangle, and if oblique, it will not always be perpendicular, but whenever the plane through the axis is perpendicular to the base of the cone.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through the axis and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (I.3); and let it also be cut by another plane cutting the plane the circle BC is in, in the straight line DE perpendicular either to the straight line BC or to it produced, and let it make as a section on the surface of the cone the line DFE. Then the straight line FG is the common section of the cutting plane and of the triangle ABC. And let any point H be taken on the section DFE, and let the straight line HK be drawn through H parallel to the straight line DE.

I say that the straight line HK meets the straight line FG, and, on being produced to the other side of the section DFE, will be bisected by FG.

For since a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC has been cut by a plane through its axis, and makes as a section the triangle ABC, and some point H on the surface, not on a side of the triangle ABC, has been taken, and since the straight line DG is perpendicular to the straight line BC, therefore the straight line drawn through H parallel to DG, that is HK, meets the triangle ABC, and if further produced to the other side of the surface, will be bisected by the triangle (i. 6).

Then since the straight line drawn through H parallel to the straight line DE meets the triangle ABC and is in the plane of the section BFE, therefore it will fall on the common section of the cutting plane and of the triangle ABC. But the straight line FG is the common section of the planes. Therefore the straight line drawn through H parallel to DE will fall on FG, and, if further produced to the other side of the section DFE, will be bisected by the straight line FG.

Then either the cone is a right cone, or the axial triangle ABC is perpendicular to the circle BC, or neither.

First let the cone be a right cone. Then the triangle ABC would be perpendicular to the circle BC (Def. 3; Eucl. xi. 18). Since then the plane ABC is perpendicular to the plane BC, and the straight line DE has been drawn in one of the planes, BC, perpendicular to their common section the straight line BC, therefore the straight line DE is perpendicular to the triangle ABC (Eucl. xi. Def. 4), and therefore to all the straight lines touching it and in the triangle ABC (Eucl. xi. Def. 3). And so it is also perpendicular to the straight line FG.

Then let the cone not be a right cone. If now the axial triangle is perpendicular to the circle BC, we could likewise show that DE is perpendicular to FG.

Then let the axial triangle ABC not be perpendicular to the circle BC. — I say that DE is not perpendicular to FG. For if possible, let it be. And it is also perpendicular to the straight line BC. Therefore DE is perpendicular to both BC and FG, and therefore it will be perpendicular to the plane through BC and FG. But the plane through BC and GF is the triangle ABC, and therefore DE is perpendicular to the triangle ABC. And therefore all the planes through it are perpendicular to the triangle ABC. But one of the planes through DE is the circle BC; therefore the circle BC is perpendicular to the triangle ABC. And so the triangle ABC will also be perpendicular to the circle BC. And this is not supposed. Therefore the straight line DE is not perpendicular to the straight line FG.

## PORISM

Then from this it is evident that the straight line FG is the diameter of the section DFE, since it bisects the straight lines drawn parallel to some straight line DE, and that it is possible for some parallels to be bisected by the diameter FG and not be perpendicular.

## Proposition 8

If a cone is cut by a plane through its axis, and is cut by another plane cutting the base of the cone in a straight line perpendicular to the base of the axial triangle, and if the diameter of the resulting section on the surface is either parallel to one of the sides of the triangle or meets one of them beyond the vertex of the cone, and the surface of the cone and the cutting plane are produced indefinitely, then the section will also increase indefinitely, and some straight line drawn from the section of the cone parallel to the straight line in the base of the cone will cut off from the diameter on the side of the vertex a straight line equal to any given straight line.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through its axis, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (i. 3). And let it be cut also by another plane cutting the circle BC in a straight line DE perpendicular to the straight line BC, and let it make as a section on the surface the line DFE. And let the diameter FG of the section DFE be either parallel to the straight line AC or on being produced meet it beyond the point A (i. 7 and porism).

I say that, if both the surface of the cone and the cutting plane are produced indefinitely, the section DFE also will increase indefinitely.

For let both the surface of the cone and the cutting plane be produced. Then it is evident that also the straight lines AB, AC, FG will be therewith produced. Since the straight line FG is either parallel to AC or produced meets it beyond the point A, therefore the straight lines FG and AC on being produced in the direction of C and G will never meet. Then let them be produced and let some point H be taken at random on the straight line FG, and let the straight line KHL be drawn through the point H parallel to the straight line BC, and MHN parallel to DE. Therefore the plane through KL and MN is parallel to the plane through BC and DE (Eucl. xi. 15). Therefore the plane KLMN is a circle (i. 4).

And since the points D, E, M, N are in the cutting plane and also on the surface of the cone, therefore they are on the common section. Therefore the section DFE has increased to the points M and N. Therefore, with the surface of the cone and the cutting plane increased to the circle KLMN, the section DFE has also increased to the points M and N. Then likewise we could show also, that if the surface of the cone and the cutting plane are extended indefinitely, the section MDFEN will also increase indefinitely.

And it is evident that some straight line will cut off on the straight line FH on the side of point F a straight line equal to any given straight line. For if we lay down the straight line FX equal to the given straight line, and draw a parallel to DE through X, it will meet the section, just as the straight line through H was also proved to meet the section in the points M and N. And so some straight line is drawn meeting the section, parallel to DE, and cutting off on FG on the side of point H a straight line equal to the given straight line.

## Proposition 9

If a cone is cut by a plane meeting both sides of the axial triangle, and neither parallel to the base nor situated subcontrariwise, then the section will not be a circle.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by some plane neither parallel to the base nor situated subcontrariwise, and let it make as a section on the surface the line DKE.

I say that the line DKE will not be a circle.

For if possible, let it be, and let the cutting plane meet the base, and let the straight line FG be the common section of the planes, and let the point H be the center of the circle BC, and let the straight line HG be drawn from it perpendicular to the straight line FG. And let a plane be extended through GH and the axis and let it make as sections on the conic surface the straight lines BA and AC (i. 1). Since then D, E, G are points in the plane through the line DKE, and also in the plane through the points A, B, C, therefore D, E, G are points on the common section of the planes. Therefore GED is a straight line (Eucl. xi. 3).

Then let some point K be taken on the line DKE, and through K let the straight line KL be drawn parallel to the straight line FG; then KM will be equal to ML (i. 7). Therefore the straight line DE is the diameter of the circle DKLE (Def. 4). Then let the straight line NMX be drawn through M parallel to the straight line BC. But KL is also parallel to FG. And so the plane through the straight lines NX and KM is parallel to the plane through the straight lines BC and FG, that is to the base (Eucl. xi. 15), and the section will be a circle (i. 4). Let it be the circle NKX.

And since the straight line FG is perpendicular to the straight line HG, the straight line KM is also perpendicular to the straight line NX (Eucl. xi. 10). And so
rect. NM, MX = sq. KM (Eucl. iii. 31; vi. 8, porism)
But
rect. DM, ME = sq. KM,
for the line DKEL is supposed a circle, and the straight line DE is its diameter.
Therefore
rect. NM, MX = rect. DM, ME.
Therefore
MN : MD : : EM : MX (Eucl. vi. 16).
Therefore triangle DMN is similar to triangle XME (Eucl. vi. 6; vi. Def. 1), and angle DNM is equal to angle MEX. But angle DNM is equal to angle ABC, for the straight line NX is parallel to the straight line BC. And therefore angle ABC is equal to angle MEX. Therefore the section is subcontrary (i. 5). And this is not supposed. Therefore the line DKE is not a circle.

## Proposition 10

If two points are taken on the section of a cone, the straight line joining the two points will fall within the section, and produced in a straight line it will fall outside.

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A, and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through the axis, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (i. 3). Then let it also be cut by another plane, and let it make as a section on the surface of the cone the line DEF, and let two points G and H be taken on the line DEF.

I say that the straight line joining the two points G and H will fall within the line DEF, and produced in a straight line it will fall outside.

For since a cone, whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, has been cut by a plane through the axis, and some points G and H have been taken on its surface which are not on a side of the axial triangle, and since the straight line joining G and H does not verge to the point A, therefore the straight line joining G and H will fall within the cone, and produced in a straight line it will fall outside (i. 2); consequently also outside the section DFE.

## Proposition 11

If a cone is cut by a plane through its axis, and also cut by another plane cutting the base of the cone in a straight line perpendicular to the base of the axial triangle, and if further the diameter of the section is parallel to one side of the axial triangle, then any straight line which is drawn from the section of the cone to its diameter parallel to the common section of the cutting plane and of the cone's base, will equal in square the rectangle contained by the straight line cut off by it on the diameter beginning from the section's vertex and by another straight line which has the ratio to the straight line between the angle of the cone and the vertex of the section that the square on the base of the axial triangle has to the rectangle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle. And let such a section be called a parabola (*παραβολή*).

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A, and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through its axis, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (i. 3). And let it also be cut by another plane cutting the base of the cone in the straight line DE perpendicular to the straight line BC, and let it make as a section on the surface of the cone the line DFE, and let the diameter of the section FG (i. 7, and Def. 4) be parallel to one side AC of the axial triangle. And let the straight line FH be drawn from the point F perpendicular to the straight line FG, and let it be contrived that
sq. BC : rect. BA, AC : : FH : FA.
And let some point K be taken at random on the section, and through K let the straight line KL be drawn parallel to the straight line DE.

I say that sq. KL = rect. HF, FL.

For let the straight line MN be drawn through L parallel to the straight line BC. And the straight line DE is also parallel to the straight line KL. Therefore the plane through KL and MN is parallel to the plane through BC and DE (Eucl. xi. 15), that is to the base of the cone. Therefore the plane through KL and MN is a circle whose diameter is MN (i. 4). And KL is perpendicular to MN since DE is also perpendicular to BC (Eucl. xi. 10). Therefore
rect. ML, LN = sq. KL (Eucl. iii. 31; vi. 8, porism).

And since
sq. BC : rect. BA, AC :: HF : FA,
and
sq. BC : rect. BA, AC comp. BC : CA, BC : BA (Eucl. vi. 23),
therefore
HF : FA comp. BC : CA, BC : BA.
But
BC : CA : : MN : NA : : ML : LF (Eucl. vi. 4),
and
BC : BA : : MN : MA : : LM : MF : : NL : FA (Eucl. vi. 2).

Therefore
HF : FA comp. ML : LF, NL : FA.
But
rect. ML, LN : rect. LF, FA comp. ML : LF, LN : FA (Eucl. vi. 23).
Therefore
HF : FA :: rect. ML, LN : rect. LF, FA
But, with the straight line FL taken as common height,
HF : FA : : rect. HF, FL : rect. LF, FA (Eucl. vi. 1),
therefore
rect. ML, LN : rect. LF, FA : : rect. HF, FL : rect. LF, FA (Eucl. v. 11).
Therefore
rect. ML, LN = rect. HF, FL (Eucl. v. 9).
But
rect. ML, LN = sq. KL,
therefore also
sq. KL = rect. HF, FL.

And let such a section be called a parabola, and let HF be called the straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to the diameter FG are applied in square (*παρ' ἣν δύνανται αἱ καταγόμεναι τεταγμένως ἐπὶ τὴν FG διάμετρον*), and let it also be called the upright side (*ὀρθία*).

1 The Greek of the phrase “the straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to the diameter are applied in square,” that is *ἡ παρ' ἣν δύνανται αἱ καταγόμεναι τεταγμένως ἐπὶ τὴν διάμετρον*, soon becomes abbreviated to *ἡ παρ' ἣν δύνανται αἱ καταγόμεναι* and to *ἡ παρ' ἣν δύνανται*. We shall translate these abbreviations by the word “parameter.” And we shall later on, after proposition XIV shorten the long expression to “the parameter of the ordinates to the diameter.” The Latin translation of *ὀρθία* (*πλευρά*) is *latus rectum* which has become an English term too.

## Proposition 12

If a cone is cut by a plane through its axis, and also by another plane cutting the base of the cone in a straight line perpendicular to the base of the axial triangle, and if the diameter of the section produced meets one side of the axial triangle beyond the vertex of the cone, then any straight line which is drawn from the section to its diameter parallel to the common section of the cutting plane and of the cone’s base, will equal in square some area applied to a straight line to which the straight line added along the diameter of the section and subtending the exterior angle of the triangle has the ratio that the square on the straight line drawn from the cone’s vertex to the triangle’s base parallel to the section’s diameter has to the rectangle contained by the sections of the base which this straight line makes when drawn, this area having as breadth the straight line cut off on the diameter beginning from the section’s vertex by this straight line from the section to the diameter and exceeding (*ὑπερβάλλον*) by a figure (*εἶδος*), similar and similarly situated to the rectangle contained by the straight line subtending the exterior angle of the triangle and by the parameter. And let such a section be called an hyperbola (*ὑπερβολή*).

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through its axis, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC (i. 3). And let it also be cut by another plane cutting the base of the cone in the straight line DE perpendicular to BC the base of the triangle ABC, and let it make as a section on the surface of the cone the line DFE, and let FG the diameter of the section (i. 7 and Def. 4) when produced meet AC one side of the triangle ABC beyond the vertex of the cone at the point H. And let the straight line AK be drawn through A parallel to the diameter of the section FG, and let it cut BC. And let the straight line FL be drawn from F perpendicular to FG, and let it be contrived that
sq. KA : rect. BK, KC : : FH : FL.
And let some point M be taken at random on the section, and through M let the straight line MN be drawn parallel to DE, and through N let the straight line NOX be drawn parallel to FL. And let the straight line HL be joined and produced to X, and let the straight lines LO and XP be drawn through L and X parallel to FN.

I say that MN is equal in square to the parallelogram FX which is applied to FL, having FN as breadth, and exceeding by a figure LX similar to the rectangle contained by HF and FL.

For let the straight line RNS be drawn through N parallel to BC; and NM is also parallel to DE. Therefore the plane through MN and RS is parallel to the plane through BC and DE, that is to the base of the cone (Eucl. xi. 15). Therefore if the plane is produced through MN and RS, the section will be a circle whose diameter is the straight line RNS (i. 4). And MN is perpendicular to it. Therefore
rect. RN, NS = sq. MN.

And since
sq. AK : rect. BK, KC : : FH : FL,
and
sq. AK : rect. BK, KC comp. AK : KC, AK : KB (Eucl. vi. 23),
therefore also
FH : FL comp. AK : KC, AK : KB.
But
AK : KC : : HG : GC : : HN : NS (Eucl. vi. 4),
and
AK : KB : : FG : GB : : FN : NR.
Therefore
HF : FL comp. HN : NS, FN : NR.
And
rect. HN, NF : rect. SN, NR comp. HN : NS, FN : NR (Eucl. vi. 23).
Therefore also
rect. HN, NF : rect. SN, NR : : HF : FL : : HN : NX (Eucl. vi. 4).

But, with the straight line FN taken as common height,
HN : NX : : rect. HN, NF : rect. FN, NX (Eucl. vi. 1).
Therefore also
rect. HN, NF : rect. SN, NR : : rect. HN, NF : rect. FN, NX (Eucl. v. 11).
Therefore
rect. SN, NR = rect. FN, NX (Eucl. v. 9).
But it was shown
sq. MN = rect. SN, NR;
therefore also
sq. MN = rect. XN, NF.

But the rectangle contained by XN and NF is the parallelogram XF. Therefore the straight line MN is equal in square to XF which is applied to the straight line FL, having FN as breadth, and exceeding by the parallelogram LX similar to the rectangle contained by HF and FL (Eucl. vi. 24).

And let such a section be called an hyperbola, and let LF be called the straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to FG are applied in square; and let the same straight line also be called the upright side, and the straight line FH the transverse side.

## Proposition 13

If a cone is cut by a plane through its axis, and is also cut by another plane on the one hand meeting both sides of the axial triangle, and on the other extended neither parallel to the base nor subcontrariwise, and if the plane the base of the cone is in, and the cutting plane meet in a straight line perpendicular either to the base of the axial triangle or to it produced, then any straight line which is drawn from the section of the cone to the diameter of the section parallel to the common section of the planes, will equal in square some area applied to a straight line to which the diameter of the section has the ratio that the square on the straight line drawn from the cone’s vertex to the triangle’s base parallel to the section’s diameter has to the rectangle contained by the intercepts of this straight line (on the base) from the sides of the triangle, an area having as breadth the straight line cut off on the diameter beginning from the section’s vertex by this straight line from the section to the diameter, and deficient (*ἐλλεῖπον*) by a figure similar and similarly situated to the rectangle contained by the diameter and parameter. And let such a section be called an ellipse (*ἔλλειψις*).

Let there be a cone whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, and let it be cut by a plane through its axis, and let it make as a section the triangle ABC. And let it also be cut by another plane on the one hand meeting both sides of the axial triangle and on the other extended neither parallel to the base of the cone nor subcontrariwise, and let it make as a section on the surface of the cone the line DE. And let the common section of the cutting plane and of the plane the base of the cone is in, be the straight line FG perpendicular to the straight line BC, and let the diameter of the section be the straight line ED (i. 7 and Def. 4). And let the straight line EH be drawn from E perpendicular to ED, and let the straight line AK be drawn through A parallel to ED, and let it be contrived that
sq. AK : rect. BK, KC : : DE : EH.
And let some point L be taken on the section, and let the straight line LM be drawn through L parallel to FG.

I say that the straight line LM is equal in square to some area which is applied to EH, having EM as breadth and deficient by a figure similar to the rectangle contained by DE and EH.

For let the straight line DH be joined, and on the one hand let the straight line MXN be drawn through M parallel to HE, and on the other let the straight lines HN and XO be drawn through H and X parallel to EM, and let the straight line PMR be drawn through M parallel to BC.

Since then PR is parallel to BC, and LM is also parallel to FG, therefore the plane through LM and PR is parallel to the plane through FG and BC, that is to the base of the cone (Eucl. xi. 15). If therefore a plane is extended through LM and PR, the section will be a circle whose diameter is PR (i. 4). And LM is perpendicular to it. Therefore
rect. PM, MR = sq. LM.

And since
sq. AK : rect. BK, KC : : ED : EH,
and
sq. AK : rect. BK, KC comp. AK : KB, AK : KC (Eucl. vi. 23),
but
AK : KB :: EG : GB : : EM : MP (Eucl. vi. 4),
and
AK : KC : : DG : GC : : DM : MR,
therefore
DE : EH comp. EM : MP, DM : MR.
But
rect. EM, MD : rect. PM, MR comp. EM : MP, DM : MR (Eucl. vi. 23).
Therefore
rect. EM, MD : rect. PM, MR : : DE : EH : : DM : MX (Eucl. vi. 4).
And, with the straight line ME taken as common height,
DM : MX : : rect. DM, ME : rect. XM, ME (Eucl. vi. 1).
Therefore also
rect. DM, ME : rect. PM, MR : : rect. DM, ME : rect. XM, ME (Eucl. v. 11).
Therefore
rect. PM, MR = rect. XM, ME (Eucl. v. 9).
But it was shown
rect. PM, MR = sq. LM;
therefore also
rect. XM, ME = sq. LM.

Therefore the straight line LM is equal in square to the parallelogram MO which is applied to the straight line HE, having EM as breadth and deficient by the figure ON similar to the rectangle contained by DE and EH (Eucl. vi. 24).

And let such a section be called an ellipse, and let EH be called the straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to DE are applied in square, and let the same straight line also be called the upright side, and the straight line ED the transverse side.

## Proposition 14

If the vertically opposite surfaces are cut by a plane not through the vertex, the section on each of the two surfaces will be that which is called the hyperbola; and the diameter of the two sections will be the same straight line; and the straight lines, to which the straight lines drawn to the diameter parallel to the straight line in the cone's base are applied in square, are equal; and the transverse side of the figure, that between the vertices of the sections, is common. And let such sections be called opposite (*ἀντικείμεναι*).

Let there be the vertically opposite surfaces whose vertex is the point A, and let them be cut by a plane not through the vertex, and let it make as sections on the surface the lines DEF and GHK.

I say that each of the two sections DEF and GHK is the so-called hyperbola.

For let there be the circle BDCF along which the line generating the surface moves, and let the plane XGOK be extended parallel to it on the vertically opposite surface; and the straight lines FD and GK are common sections of the sections GHK and FED, and of the circles (i. 4). Then they will be parallel (Eucl. xi. 16). And let the straight line LAU be the axis of the conic surface, and the points L and U be the centers of the circles, and let a straight line drawn from L perpendicular to the straight line FD be produced to the points B and C, and let a plane be produced through the straight line BC and the axis. Then it will make as sections in the circles the parallel straight lines XO and BC (Eucl. xi. 16), and on the surface the straight lines BAO and CAX (i. 1 and Def. 4).

Then the straight line XO will be perpendicular to the straight line GK, since the straight line BC is also perpendicular to the straight line FD, and each of the two is parallel to the other (Eucl. xi. 10). And since the plane through the axis meets the sections in the points M and N within the lines, it is clear that the plane also cuts the lines. Let it cut them at H and E; therefore M, E, H, and N are points on the plane through the axis and in the plane the lines are in; therefore the line MEHN is a straight line (Eucl. xi. 3). It is also evident both that X, H, A, and C are in a straight line and B, E, A, and O also. For they are both on the conic surface and in the plane through the axis (i. 1).

Let then the straight lines HR and EP be drawn from H and E perpendicular to HE, and let the straight line SAT be drawn through A parallel to MEHN, and let it be contrived that
HE : EP : : sq. AS : rect. BS, SC,
and
EH : HR :: sq. AT : rect. OT, TX.

Since then a cone, whose vertex is the point A and whose base is the circle BC, has been cut by a plane through its axis, and it has made as a section the triangle ABC; and it has also been cut by another plane cutting the base of the cone in the straight line DMF perpendicular to the straight line BC, and it has made as a section on the surface the line DEF; and the diameter ME produced has met one side of the axial triangle beyond the vertex of the cone, and through the point A the straight line AS has been drawn parallel to the diameter of the section EM, and from E the straight line EP has been drawn perpendicular to the straight line EM, and
EH : EP :: sq. AS : rect. BS, SC,
therefore the section DEF is an hyperbola (i. 12), and EP is the straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to EM are applied in square, and the straight line HE is the transverse side of the figure. And likewise GHK is also an hyperbola whose diameter is the straight line HN and whose straight line to which the straight lines drawn ordinatewise to HN are applied is HR, and the transverse side of whose figure is HE.

I say that the straight line HR is equal to the straight line EP.

For since BC is parallel to XO,
AS : SC :: AT : TX
and
AS : SB :: AT : TO.
But
sq. AS : rect. BS, SC comp. AS : SC, AS : SB (Eucl. vi. 23)
and
sq. AT : rect. XT, TO comp. AT : TX, AT : TO;
therefore
sq. AS : rect. BS, SC : : sq. AT : rect. XT, TO.
Also
sq. AS : rect. BS, SC :: HE : EP,
and
sq. AT : rect. XT, TO :: HE : HR.

Therefore also

HE : EP :: EH : HR (Eucl. v. 11).

Therefore

EP = HR (Eucl. v. 9).

## Proposition 15

If in an ellipse a straight line, drawn ordinatewise from the midpoint of the diameter, is produced both ways to the section, and if it is contrived that, as the straight line so produced is to the diameter, so is the diameter to some straight line, then any straight line which is drawn, from the section to the straight line produced, parallel to the diameter, will equal in square the area applied to this third proportional and having as breadth the straight line cut off by it beginning from the section and deficient by a figure similar to the rectangle contained by the straight line to which the straight lines are drawn and by the parameter; and if further produced to the other side of the section, will be bisected by the straight line to which it has been drawn.

Let there be an ellipse whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let AB be bisected at the point C, and through C let the straight line DCE be drawn ordinatewise and produced both ways to the section, and from the point D let the straight line DF be drawn perpendicular to DE. And let it be contrived that

DE : AB :: AB : DF

And let some point G be taken on the section, and through G let the straight line GH be drawn parallel to AB, and let EF be joined, and through H let the straight line HL be drawn parallel to DF, and through F and L let the straight lines FK and LM be drawn parallel to HD.

I say that the straight line GH is equal in square to the area DL which is applied to the straight line DF, having as breadth the straight line DH and deficient by a figure LF similar to the rectangle contained by ED and DF.

For let AN be the parameter of the ordinates to AB, and let BN be joined; and through G let the straight line GX be drawn parallel to DE, and through X and C let the straight lines XO and CP be drawn parallel to AN, and through N, O, and P let the straight lines NU, OS, and TP be drawn parallel to AB. Therefore

sq. DC = rect. AP, sq. GX = rect. AO (i. 13).

And since

BA : AN :: BC : CP :: PT : TN (Eucl. vi. 4),

and

BC = CA = TP,

therefore

CP = TA,

and

rect. AP = rect. TR,
rect. XT = rect. TU.

Since also

rect. OT = rect. OR (Eucl. i. 43),

and area AD is common, therefore

rect. TU = rect. NS.

But

rect. TU = rect. TX,

and TS is common. Therefore

rect. NP = rect. PA = rect. AO + rect. PO;

and so

rect. PA - rect. AO = rect. PO.

Also

rect. AP = sq. CD, rect. AO = sq. XG,

and

rect. OP = rect. OS,SP;

therefore

sq. CD - sq. GX = rect. OS,SP.

Since also the straight line DE has been cut into equal parts at C, and into unequal parts at H, therefore

rect. EH,HD + sq. CP = sq. CD (Eucl. ii. 5),

or

rect. OS,SP + sq. GX = sq. CD.

Therefore

sq. CD - sq. GX = rect. EH, HD;

but

sq. CD - sq. GX = rect. OS,SP;

therefore

rect. OS,SP = rect. EH,HD.

And since

DE : AB :: AB : DF,

therefore

DE : DF :: sq. CD : sq. AC;

And

DE : DF :: EH : HL (Eucl. vi. 4),

or

DE : DF :: rect. EH, HD : rect. DH,HL (Eucl. vi. 1),
and DE : DF :: sq. CD : sq. AC,
and sq. CD : sq. AC :: rect. OS,SP : sq. OS.
Therefore also

rect. EH,HD : rect. DH,HL :: rect. OS,SP : sq. OS.

And

rect. EH,HD = rect. OS,SP;

therefore

rect. DH,HL = sq. OS = sq. CP.

Therefore the straight line GH is equal in square to the area DL which is applied to the straight line DF, deficient by a figure FL similar to the rectangle contained by ED and DF (Eucl. vi. 24).

I say then that also, if produced to the other side of the section, the straight line GH will be bisected by the straight line DE.

For let it be produced and let it meet the section at W, and let the straight line WY be drawn from W parallel to GX, and through Y let the straight line YZ be drawn parallel to AN. And since

GX = WY,

therefore also

sq. GX = sq. WY.

But

sq. GX = rect. AX,XO (i. 13),

and

sq. WY = rect. AY, YZ (i. 13).

Therefore

AX : AY :: YZ : XO.

And

OX : ZY :: XB : BY (Eucl. vi. 4);

therefore also

AY : AX :: XB : BY.

And separando

YX : AX :: YX : BY (Eucl. v. 17).

Therefore

AX = YB.

And also

AC = CB;

therefore also the remainders

XC = CY;

and so also

GH = HW.

Therefore the straight line HG, produced to the other side of the section, is bisected by the straight line DE.

## Proposition 16

If through the midpoint of the transverse side of the opposite sections a straight line be drawn parallel to a straight line drawn ordinatewise, it will be a diameter of the opposite sections conjugate to the diameter just mentioned.

Let there be the opposite sections whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let AB be bisected at C, and through C let the straight line CD be drawn parallel to a straight line drawn ordinatewise.

I say that the straight line CD is a diameter conjugate to AB.

For let the straight lines AE and BF be drawn ordinatewise, and let the straight lines AF and BE be joined and produced, and let some point G be taken at random on either section, and through G let the straight line GH be drawn parallel to AB, and from G and H let the straight lines GK and HL be drawn ordinatewise, and through K and L let the straight lines KM and LN be drawn parallel to AE and BF. Since then

GK = HL (Eucl. i. 34),

therefore also

sq. GK = sq. HL,

and

sq. GK = rect. AK,KM (i. 12),

therefore

sq. HL = rect. BL,LN (i. 12);

And since

AE = BF,

But

AE : AB :: BF : BA (Eucl. v. 7).

and as

AE : AB :: MK : KB (Eucl. vi. 4),

And therefore

BF : BA :: NL : LA (Eucl. vi. 4).

MK : KB :: NL : LA.

But, with KA taken as common height,

MK : KB :: rect. MK,KA : rect. BK,KA,

and, with BL taken as common height,

NL : LA :: rect. NL,LB : rect. AL,LB.

And therefore

rect. MK,KA : rect. BK,KA :: rect. NL,LB : rect. AL,LB.

And alternately

rect. MK,KA : rect. NL,LB :: rect. BK,KA : rect. AL,LB (Eucl. v. 16).

And

rect. AK, KM = rect. BL, LN;

therefore

rect. BK, KA = rect. AL,LB;

therefore

AK = LB.
^1

But also

AC = CB,

and therefore

KC = CL,

and so also

GX = XH.

Therefore the straight line GH has been bisected by the straight line CD; and is parallel to the straight line AB. Therefore the straight line CD is a diameter and conjugate to the straight line AB (Defs. 4, 6).

^1 The intermediary steps to this conclusion are as follows. If

rect. BK, KA = rect. AL, LB

then

BK : LB :: AL : KA,

and componendo

(BA + AK - LB) : LB :: (BA + LB - KA) : KA.

## Second Definitions

9. Let the midpoint of the diameter of both the hyperbola and the ellipse be called the center of the section, and let the straight line drawn from the center to meet the section be called the radius of the section.

10. And likewise let the midpoint of the transverse side of the opposite sections be called the center.

11. And let the straight line drawn from the center parallel to an ordinate, being a mean proportional to the sides of the figure (*to eidos*) and bisected by the center, be called the second diameter.

## Proposition 17

If in a section of a cone a straight line is drawn from the vertex of the section, and parallel to an ordinate, it will fall outside the section (Cf. Eucl. iii. 16).

Let there be a section of a cone, whose diameter is the straight line AB.

I say that the straight line drawn from the vertex, that is from the point A, parallel to an ordinate, will fall outside the section.

For if possible, let it fall within as AC. Since then a point C has been taken at random on a section of a cone, therefore the straight line drawn from the point C within the section parallel to an ordinate will meet the diameter AB and will be bisected by it (i. 7). Therefore the straight line AC produced will be bisected by the straight line AB. And this is absurd. For the straight line AC, if produced, will fall outside the section (i. 10). Therefore the straight line drawn from the point A parallel to an ordinate will not fall within the section; therefore it will fall outside; and therefore it is tangent to the section.

## Proposition 18

If a straight line, meeting a section of a cone and produced both ways, falls outside the section, and some point is taken within the section, and through it a parallel to the straight line meeting the section is drawn, the parallel so drawn, if produced both ways, will meet the section.

Let there be a section of a cone and the straight line AFB meeting it, and let it fall, when produced both ways, outside the section. And let some point C be taken within the section, and through C let the straight line CD be drawn parallel to the straight line AB.

I say that the straight line CD produced both ways will meet the section.

For let some point E be taken on the section, and let the straight line EF be joined. And since the straight line AB is parallel to CD, and some straight line EF meets AB, therefore CD produced will also meet EF. And if it meets EF between the points E and F, it is evident that it also meets the section, but if beyond the point E, that it will first meet the section. Therefore CD produced to the side of points D and E meets the section. Then likewise we could show that, produced to the side of points F and B, it also meets it. Therefore the straight line CD produced both ways will meet the section.

## Proposition 19

In every section of a cone, any straight line drawn from the diameter parallel to an ordinate, will meet the section.

Let there be a section of a cone whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let some point B be taken on the diameter, and through B let the straight line BC be drawn parallel to an ordinate.

I say that the straight line BC produced will meet the section.

For let some point D be taken on the section. But A is also on the section; therefore the straight line joined from A to D will fall within the section (i. 10). And since the straight line drawn from A parallel to an ordinate falls outside the section (i. 17), and the straight line AD meets it, and the straight line BC is parallel to the ordinate, therefore BC will also meet AD. And if it meets AD between the points A and D, it is evident that it will also meet the section, but, if beyond point D as at E, that it will first meet the section. Therefore the straight line drawn from B parallel to an ordinate will meet the section.

## Proposition 20

If in a parabola two straight lines are dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, the squares on them will be to each other as the straight lines cut off by them on the diameter beginning from the vertex^1 are to each other.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let some points C and D be taken on it, and from the points C and D let the straight lines CE and DF be dropped ordinatewise to AB.

I say that

sq. DF : sq. CE :: FA : AE.

For let AG be the parameter; therefore

sq. DF = rect. FA, AG,

and

sq. CE = rect. EA,AG (i. 11).

Therefore

sq. DF : sq. CE :: rect. FA, AG : rect. EA,AG.

But

rect. FA, AG : rect. EA,AG :: FA : AE (Eucl. vi. 1);

and therefore

sq. DF : sq. CE :: FA : AE.

^1 These are usually called “abscissas” from the Latin *abscindere*.

## Proposition 21

If in an hyperbola or ellipse or in the circumference of a circle straight lines are dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, the squares on them will be to the areas contained by the straight lines cut off by them beginning from the ends of the transverse side of the figure, as the upright side of the figure is to the transverse, and to each other as the areas contained by the straight lines cut off (abscissas), as we have said.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diameter is AB and whose parameter is the straight line AC, and let the straight lines DE and FG be dropped ordinatewise to the diameter.

sq. FG : sq. DE :: rect. AG,GB : rect. AE,EB.

For let the straight line BC determining the figure be joined, and through E and G let the straight lines EH and GK be drawn parallel to the straight line AC. Therefore

sq. FG = rect. KG,GA
sq. DE = rect. HE,EA (i. 12,13).

And since

KG : GB :: CA : AB;

and, with AG taken as common height,

KG : GB :: rect. KG,GA : rect. BG,GA,

therefore

CA : AB :: rect. KG,GA : rect. BG,GA.

or

CA : AB :: sq. FG : rect. BG,GA.

Then also for the same reasons

CA : AB :: sq. DE : rect. BE,EA.

And therefore

sq. FG : rect. BG,GA :: sq. DE : rect. BE,EA;

alternately

sq. FG : sq. DE :: rect. BG,GA : rect. BE,EA.^1

^1 Eutocius commenting says:
> “It is to be noted that the parameter, that is the upright side, in the case of the circle is equal to the diameter. For if
> sq. DE : rect. AE, EB :: CA : AB
> and only in the case of the circle
> sq. DE = rect. AE, EB,
> therefore also CA=AB.
> “And this must also be noted that the ordinates on the circumference of the circle are in every case perpendicular to the diameter and are in a straight line with the parallels to AC (Eucl. iii. 3, 4).”

## Proposition 22

If a straight line cuts a parabola or hyperbola in two points, not meeting the diameter inside, it will, if produced, meet the diameter of the section outside the section.

Let there be a parabola or hyperbola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let some straight line cut the section in two points C and D.

I say that the straight line DC, if produced, will meet the straight line AB outside the section.

For let the straight lines CE and DB be dropped ordinatewise from C and D; and first let the section be a parabola. Since then in the parabola

sq. CE : sq. DB :: EA : AB (i. 20),

and

EA > AB,

therefore also

sq. CE > sq. DB (Eucl. v. 14).

And so also

CE > DB.

And they are parallel; therefore CD produced will meet the diameter AB outside the section (i. 10; Eucl. i. 33).

But then let it be an hyperbola. Since then in the hyperbola

sq. CE : sq. DB :: rect. AE,EB : rect. AB,BF (i. 21),

therefore also

sq. CE > sq. DB.

And they are parallel; therefore the straight line CD produced will meet the diameter of the section outside the section.

## Proposition 23

If a straight line lying between the two (*conjugate*) diameters^1 cuts the ellipse, it will, when produced, meet each of the diameters outside the section.

Let there be an ellipse whose diameters are the straight lines AB and CD (i. 15), and let some straight line EF lying between the diameters AB and CD cut the section.

I say that the straight line EF, when produced, will meet each of the straight lines AB and CD outside the section.

For let the straight lines GE and FH be dropped ordinatewise from E and F to AB; and the straight lines EK and FL ordinatewise to CD. Therefore

sq. EG : sq. FH :: rect. BG,GA : rect. BH,HA (i. 21)

and

sq. FL : sq. EK :: rect. DL,LC : rect. DK,KC (i. 21).

And

rect. BG, GA > rect. BH, HA;

for the point G is nearer the midpoint (Eucl. vi. 27; ii. 5); and

rect. DL,LC > rect. DK,KC;

therefore also

sq. GE > sq. FH,

and

sq. FL > sq. EK;

therefore also

GE > FH,

and

FL > EK.

And GE is parallel to FH, and FL to EK; therefore the straight line EF produced will meet each of the diameters AB and CD outside the section (i. 10; Eucl. i. 33).

^1 So far Apollonius, by theorems i. 6, 13, 15, has shown, for every ellipse, the existence of at least one diameter and of one set of conjugate diameters, but of no more. He can therefore now speak of “the two diameters.” Later on he will show the existence of an infinite number of such sets. The same is true of hyperbolas.

## Proposition 24

If a straight line, meeting a parabola or hyperbola at a point, when produced both ways, falls outside the section, then it will meet the diameter.

Let there be a parabola or hyperbola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let the straight line CDE meet it at D, and, when produced both ways, let it fall outside the section.

I say that it will meet the diameter AB.

For let some point F be taken on the section, and let the straight line DF be joined; therefore DF produced will meet the diameter of the section (i. 22). Let it meet it at A; and the straight line CDE lies between the section and the straight line FDA. And therefore the line CDE produced will meet the diameter outside the section.

## Proposition 25

If a straight line, meeting an ellipse between the two (*conjugate*) diameters and produced both ways, falls outside the section, it will meet each of the diameters.

Let there be an ellipse whose diameters are the straight lines AB and CD (i. 15), and let EF, some straight line between the two diameters, meet it at G, and produced both ways fall outside the section.

I say that the straight line EF will meet each of the straight lines AB and CD.

Let the straight lines GH and GK be dropped ordinatewise to the straight lines AB and CD respectively. Since GK is parallel to AB (i. 15), and some straight line GF has met GK, therefore it will also meet AB. Then likewise EF will also meet CD.

## Proposition 26

If in a parabola or hyperbola a straight line is drawn parallel to the diameter of the section, it will meet the section in one point only.

Let there first be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line ABC, and whose upright side is the straight line AD, and let the straight line EF be drawn parallel to AB.

I say that the straight line EF produced will meet the section.

For let some point E be taken on EF, and from E let the straight line EG be drawn parallel to an ordinate, and let

rect. DA,AC > sq. GE,

and from C let CH be erected ordinatewise (i. 19). Therefore

sq. HC = rect. DA, AC (i. 11).

But

rect. DA,AC > sq. EG,

therefore

sq. HC > sq. EG,

therefore

HC > EG.

And they are parallel; therefore the straight line EF produced cuts the straight line HC, and so it will also meet the section.

Let it meet it at the point K.

Then I say also that it will meet it in the one point K only.

For if possible, let it also meet it in the point L. Since then a straight line cuts a parabola in two points, if produced it will meet the diameter of the section (i. 22). And this is absurd, for it is supposed parallel. Therefore the straight line EF produced meets the section in only one point.

Next let the section be an hyperbola, and the straight line AB the transverse side of the figure, and the straight line AD the upright side, and let the straight line DB be joined and produced. Then with the same things being constructed, let the straight line CM be drawn from C parallel to AD. Since then

rect. MC,CA > rect. DA, AC,

and

sq. CH = rect. MC,CA,

and

rect. DA,AC > sq. GE,

therefore also

sq. CH > sq. GE.

And so also

CH > GE,

and the same things as in the first case will come to pass.

## Proposition 27

If a straight line cuts the diameter of a parabola, then produced both ways it will meet the section.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let some straight line CD cut it within the section.

I say that the straight line CD produced both ways will meet the section.

For let some straight line AE be drawn from A parallel to an ordinate; therefore the straight line AE will fall outside the section (i. 17).

Then either the straight line CD is parallel to the straight line AE or not.

If now it is parallel to it, it has been dropped ordinatewise, so that produced both ways it will meet the section (i. 18).

Next let it not be parallel to AE, but produced let it meet AE at E. Then it is evident that it meets the section the side the point E is on; for if it meets AE, a fortiori it cuts the section.

I say that, produced the other way, it also meets the section. For let the straight line MA be the parameter and the straight line GF an ordinate, and let

sq. AD = rect. BA,AF (Eucl. vi. 11),

and let the straight line BK, parallel to the ordinate, meet the straight line DC at C. Since

rect. BA,AF = sq. AD,

hence

AB : AD :: AD : AF;

and therefore,

BD : DF :: AB : AD (Eucl. v. 19).

Therefore also

sq. BD : sq. DF :: sq. AB : sq. AD.

But since

sq. AD = rect. BA,AF,

hence

AB : AF :: sq. AB : sq. AD :: sq. BD : sq. FD.

But

sq. BD : sq. DF :: sq. BC : sq. FG,

and

AB : AF :: rect. BA, AM : rect. FA, AM.

Therefore

sq. BC : sq. FG :: rect. BA, AM : rect. FA, AM;

and alternately

sq. BC : rect. BA, AM :: sq. FG : rect. FA, AM.

But

sq. FG = rect. FA, AM

because of the section (i. 11). Therefore also

sq. BC = rect. BA, AM.

But the straight line AM is the upright side,^1 and the straight line BC is parallel to an ordinate. Therefore the section passes through the point C (i. 20), and the straight line CD meets the section at the point C.

^1 The text reads *πλαγία* which is impossible. I have corrected to *ὀρθία*.

## Proposition 28

If a straight line touches one of the opposite sections, and some point is taken within the other section, and through it a straight line is drawn parallel to the tangent, then produced both ways, it will meet the section.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let some straight line CD touch the section at A, and let some point E be taken within the other section, and through E let the straight line EF be drawn parallel to the straight line CD.

I say that the straight line EF produced both ways will meet the section.

Since then it has been proved that the straight line CD produced will meet the diameter AB (i. 24), and EF is parallel to it, therefore EF produced will meet the diameter. Let it meet it at G, and let AH be made equal to GB, and through H let HK (i. 18) be drawn parallel to EF, and let the straight line KL be dropped ordinatewise, and let GM be made equal to LH, and let the straight line MN be drawn parallel to an ordinate and let GN be further produced in the same straight line. And since KL is parallel to MN, and KH to GN, and LM is one straight line, triangle KHL is similar to triangle HMN. And

LH = GM;

therefore

KL = MN.

And so also

sq. KL = sq. MN.

And since

LH = GM,

and

AH = BG,

and AB is common, therefore

BL = AM;

therefore

rect. BL, LA = rect. AM, MB.

Therefore

rect. BL,LA : sq. LK :: rect. AM, MB : sq. MN.

And

rect. BL,LA : sq. LK :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21);

therefore also

rect. AM, MB : sq. MN :: the transverse : the upright.

Therefore the point N is on the section. Therefore the straight line EF produced will meet the section at the point N (i. 21).

Likewise then it could be shown that produced to the other side it will meet the section.

## Proposition 29

If in opposite sections a straight line is drawn through the center to meet either of the sections, then produced it will cut the other section.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameter is the straight line AB, and whose center is the point C, and let the straight line CD cut the section AD.

I say that it will also cut the other section.

For let the straight line ED be dropped ordinatewise, and let the straight line BF be made equal to the straight line AE, and let the straight line FG be drawn ordinatewise (i. 19). And since

EA = BF,

and AB is common, therefore

rect. BE,EA = rect. BF,FA.

And since

rect. BE,EA : sq. DE :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21),

but also

rect. BF,FA : sq. FG :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21),

therefore also

rect. BE,EA : sq. DE :: rect. BF, FA : sq. FG (i. 14).

But

rect. BE,EA = rect. BF,FA;

therefore also

sq. DE = sq. FG.

Since then

EC = CF,

and

DE = FG,

and EF is a straight line, and ED is parallel to FG, therefore DG is also a straight line (Eucl. vi. 32). And therefore CD will also cut the other section.

## Proposition 30

If in an ellipse or in opposite sections a straight line is drawn in both directions from the center, meeting the section, it will be bisected at the center.

Let there be an ellipse or opposite sections, and their diameter the straight line AB, and their center C, and through C let some straight line DCE be drawn (i. 29).

I say that the straight line CD is equal to the straight line CE.

For let the straight lines DF and EG be drawn ordinatewise. And since

rect. BF,FA : sq. FD :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21),

but also

rect. AG,GB : sq. GE :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21),

therefore also

rect. BF,FA : sq. FD :: rect. AG,GB : sq. GE (i. 14).

And alternately

rect. BF,FA : rect. AG,GB :: sq. FD : sq. GE.

But

sq. FD : sq. GE :: sq. FC : sq. CG (Eucl. vi. 4);

therefore alternately

rect. BF,FA : sq. FC :: rect. AG,GB : sq. CG.

Therefore also, componendo in the case of the ellipse, and inversely and convertendo in the case of the opposite sections (Eucl. v. Defs. 14, 13, 16),

sq. AC : sq. CF :: sq. BC : sq. CG (Eucl. ii. 5,6);

and alternately. But

sq. CB = sq. AC;

therefore also

sq. CG = sq. CF.

Therefore

CG = CF.

And the straight lines DF and GE are parallel; therefore also

DC = CE.

## Proposition 31

If on the transverse side of the figure of an hyperbola some point be taken cutting off from the vertex of the section not less than half of the transverse side of the figure, and a straight line be drawn from it to meet the section, then, when further produced, it will fall within the section on the near side of the section.

Let there be an hyperbola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let C some point on the diameter be taken cutting off the straight line CB not less than half of AB, and let some straight line CD be drawn to meet the section.

I say that the straight line CD produced will fall within the section.

For if possible, let it fall outside the section as the line CDE (i. 24), and from E a point at random let the straight line EG be dropped ordinatewise, also DH; and first let

AC = CB.

And since

sq. EG : sq. DH > sq. FG : sq. DH (Eucl. v. 8),

but

sq. EG : sq. DH :: sq. CG : sq. CH

because of EG’s being parallel to DH, and

sq. FG : sq. DH :: rect. AG,GB : rect. AH,HB

because of the section (i. 21),

therefore

sq. CG : sq. CH > rect. AG,GB : rect. AH,HB.

Alternately therefore

sq. CG : rect. AG,GB > sq. CH : rect. AH,HB

Therefore, separando,
sq. CB : rect. AG,GB > sq. CB : rect. AH,HB
and this is impossible (Eucl. v. 8). Therefore the straight line CDE will not
fall outside the section; therefore inside. And for this reason the straight line
from some one of the points on the straight line AC will *a fortiori* fall inside,
since it will also fall inside CD.

^1 The rules governing operations on inequalities in proportions are not developed by
Euclid in Book V of the *Elements*. But they can be deduced on Euclid’s principles.

APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

## Proposition 32

If a straight line is drawn through the vertex of a section of a cone, parallel to an
ordinate, then it touches the section, and another straight line will not fall into the
space between the conic section and this straight line.

Let there be a section of a cone, first the so-called parabola whose diameter
is the straight line AB, and from A let the straight line AC be drawn parallel
to an ordinate.

Now it has been shown that it falls outside the
section (i. 17).

Then I say that also another straight line will not
fall into the space between the straight line AC
and the section.

For if possible, let it fall in, as the straight line
AD, and let some point D be taken on it at ran¬
dom, and let the straight line DE be dropped or-
dinatewise, and let the straight line AF be the
parameter of the ordinates. And since
sq. DE : sq. EA > sq. GE : sq. EA (Eucl. v. 8),
and
sq. GE = rect. FA, AE (i. 11),
therefore also
sq. DE : sq. EA > rect. FA, AE : sq. EA,
or
> FA : EA.

Let it be contrived then that
sq. DE : sq. EA :: FA : HA (Eucl. vi. 20, 11),
and through the point H let the straight line HLK be drawn parallel to ED.
Since then
sq. DE : sq. EA :: FA : AH :: rect. FA, AH : sq. AH,
and
sq. DE : sq. EA :: sq. KH : sq. HA (Eucl. vi. 22),
and
sq. HL = rect. FA, AH (i. 11),
therefore also
sq. KH : sq. HA :: sq. LH : sq. HA.
Therefore
KH = HL;
and this is absurd. Therefore another straight line will not fall into the space
between the straight line AC and the section.

Next let the section be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle
whose diameter is the straight line AB, and whose upright side is the straight
line AF; and let the straight line BF be joined and produced, and from the
point A let the straight line AC be drawn parallel to an ordinate.

Now it has been shown that it falls outside the section (i. 17).

Then I say that also another straight line will not fall into the space be¬
tween the straight line AC and the section.

For if possible, let it fall, as the straight line AD, and let some point D be
taken at random on it, and from it let the straight line DE be dropped ordi-

CONICS I 639

natewise, and through E let the straight line EM be drawn parallel to the
straight line AF.

And since
sq. GE = rect. AE, EM (i. 12, 13)
let it be contrived that
rect. AE, EN = sq. DE,
and let the straight line joining AN cut the straight line FM at X, and through
X let the straight line XH be drawn parallel to FA, and through H, HLK
parallel to AC. Since then
sq. DE = rect. AM, EN,
hence
NE : ED :: DE : EA;
But
NE : EA :: sq. DE : sq. EA (Eucl. vi. 20).
and
NE : EA :: XH : HA,
Therefore
sq. DE : sq. EA :: sq. KH : sq. HA.
XH : HA :: sq. KH : sq. HA;

640 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

therefore
XH : HK :: KH : HA (Eucl. vi. 20).
Therefore
sq. KH = rect. AH, HX;
but also
sq. LH = rect. AH, HX
because of the section (i. 12, 13);
therefore
sq. KH = sq. HL;
and this is absurd. Therefore another straight line will not fall into the space
between the straight line AC and the section.

## Proposition 33

If in a parabola some point is taken, and from it an ordinate is dropped to the
diameter, and, to the straight line cut off by it on the diameter from the vertex, a
straight line in the same straight line from its extremity is made equal, then the
straight line joined from the point thus resulting to the point taken will touch the
section.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the
straight line AB, and let the straight line CD be
dropped ordinatewise, and let the straight line
AE be made equal to the straight line ED, and
let the straight line AC be joined.

I say that the straight line AC produced will
fall outside the section.

For if possible, let it fall within, as the straight
line CF, and let the straight line GB be dropped
ordinatewise. And since
sq. BG : sq. CD > sq. FB : sq. CD,
but
sq. FB : sq. CD :: sq. BA : sq. AD,
and
sq. BG : sq. CD :: BE : DE (i. 20),
therefore
BE : DE > sq. BA : sq. AD.
But
BE : DE :: 4 rect. BE, EA : 4 rect. DE, EA;
therefore also
4 rect. BE, EA : 4 rect. DE, EA > sq. AB : sq. AD.
Therefore alternately
4 rect. BE, EA : sq. AB > 4 rect. DE, EA : sq. AD;
and this is absurd; for since
AE = DE,
hence
4 rect. DE, EA = sq. AD.
But
4 rect. BE, EA < sq. AB;
for E is not the midpoint of AB (Eucl. vi. 27; ii. 5). Therefore the straight line
AC does not fall within the section; therefore it touches it.

CONICS I 641

## Proposition 34

If on an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle some point is taken, and
from it a straight line is dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, and whatever ratio
the straight lines cut off by the ordinate from the ends of the figure’s transverse side
have to each other, that ratio have the segments of the transverse side to each other
so that the segments from the vertex are corresponding, then the straight line joining
the point taken on the transverse side and that taken on the section will touch the
section.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam-

eter is the straight line AB, and let some point C be taken on the section, and
from C let the straight line CD be drawn ordinatewise, and let it be contrived
that
BD : DA :: BE : EA,^1
and let the straight line EC be joined.

I say that the straight line CE touches the section.

^1 This construction is easy. In the case of the hyperbola, componendo,
BD+DA : DA :: BA : EA;
and in the case of the ellipse, separando,
BD-DA : DA :: BA : EA.
This proportion is the same as the harmonic proportion defined by Nicomachus in *his
Introduction to Arithmetic*. For if
BD : DA :: BE : EA,
then BD+DA : BD :: BA : BE
and BA : BD :: BE-EA : BE.
Hence BD+DA : BA :: BA : BE-EA,
But DA = BD - BA, EA = BA - BE.
Therefore 2 BD-BA : BA :: BA : 2 BE -BA.
And so BA is the harmonic mean between BD and BE.

642 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

For if possible, let it cut it, as the straight line ECF, and let some point F
be taken on it, and let the straight line GFH be dropped ordinatewise, and let
the straight lines AL and BK be drawn through A and B parallel to the
straight line EC, and let the straight lines DC, BC, and GC be joined and pro¬
duced to the points M, X, and K. And since
BD : DA :: BE : EA,
but
BD : DA :: BK : AN,
and
BE : AE :: BC : CX :: BK : XN (Eucl. vi. 4),
therefore
BK : AN :: BK : XN;
therefore
AN = NX.
Therefore
rect. AN, NX > rect. AO, OX (Eucl. vi. 27; ii. 5).
Therefore
NX : XO > OA : AN.^1

> ^1 Eutocius, commenting, says: “For since
> rect. AN, NX > rect. AO, OX,
> let rect. AN, NX = rect. AO, XP
> where XP is some line such that XP > XO;
> therefore OA : AN :: NX : XP.
> But NX : XO > NX : XP (Eucl. v. 8)
> and therefore NX : XO > OA : AN.

> therefore rect. XN, NA = rect. AO, XP;
> and so rect. XN, NA > rect. AO, OX.”

But
NX : XO :: KB : BM (Eucl. vi. 4);
therefore
KB : BM > OA : AN.
Therefore
rect. KB, AN > rect. BM, OA.
And so
rect. KB, AN : sq. CE > rect. BM, OA : sq. CE (Eucl. v. 8).
But
rect. KB, AN : sq. CE :: rect. BD, DA : sq. DE
through the similarity of the triangles BKD, ECD, and NAD,^2 and

> A similar proof holds for the proportion following.

CONICS I 643

rect. BM, OA : sq. CE :: rect. BG, GA : sq. GE;
therefore
rect. BD, DA : sq. DE > rect. BG, GA : sq. GE.
Therefore alternately
rect. BD, DA : rect. BG, GA > sq. DE : sq. GE.
But
rect. BD, DA : rect. BG, GA :: sq. CD : sq. GH (i. 21),
and
sq. DE : sq. EG :: sq. CD : sq. FG (Eucl. vi. 4),
therefore also
sq. CD : sq. HG > sq. CD : sq. FG.
Therefore
HG < FG (Eucl. v. 10);
and this is impossible. Therefore the straight line EC does not cut the section;
therefore it touches it.

## Proposition 35

If a straight line touches a parabola, meeting the diameter outside the section, the
straight line drawn from the point of contact ordinatewise to the diameter will cut
off on the diameter beginning from the vertex of the section a straight line equal to
the straight line between the vertex and the tangent, and no straight line will fall
into the space between the tangent and the section.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let the
straight line BC be erected ordinatewise, and let the straight line AC be tan¬
gent to the section.

I say that the straight line AG is equal to
the straight line GB.

For if possible, let it be unequal to it, and
let the straight line GE be made equal to
AG, and let the straight line EF be erected
ordinatewise, and let the straight line AF be
joined. Therefore AF produced will meet the
straight line AC (i. 33); and this is impossi¬
ble. For two straight lines will have the same
ends. Therefore the straight line AG is not
unequal to the straight line GB; therefore it
is equal.

Then I say that no straight line will fall into the space between the straight
line AC and the section.

For if possible, let the straight line CD fall in between, and let GE be made
equal to GD, and let the straight line EF be erected ordinatewise. Therefore
the straight line joined from D to F touches the section (i. 33); therefore pro¬
duced it will fall outside it. And so it will meet DC, and two straight lines will
have the same ends; and this is impossible. Therefore a straight line will not
fall into the space between the section and the straight line AC.

## Proposition 36

If some straight line, meeting the transverse side of the figure touches an hyperbola
or ellipse or circumference of a circle, and a straight line is dropped from the point

APOLLONIUS OF PERGA 644

of contact ordinatewise to the diameter, then as the straight line cut off by the tan¬
gent from the end of the transverse side is to the straight line cut off by the tangent
from the other end of that side, so will the straight line cut off by the ordinate from
the end of the side be to the straight line cut off by the ordinate from the other end of
the side in such a way that the corresponding straight lines are continuous; and
another straight line will not fall into the space between the tangent and the section
of the cone.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam¬
eter is the straight line AB, and let the straight line CD be tangent, and let the
straight line CE be dropped ordinatewise.

I say that
BE : EA :: BD : DA.

For if it is not, let it be
BD : DA :: BG : GA,
and let the straight line GF be erected ordinatewise; therefore the straight line

joined from D to F will touch the section (i. 34); therefore produced it will
meet CD. Therefore two straight lines will have the same ends; and this is
impossible.

I say that no straight line will fall between the section and the straight line
CD.

For if possible, let it fall between, as the straight line CH, and let it be con¬
trived that
BH : HA :: BG : GA,
and let the straight line GF be erected ordinatewise; therefore the straight line
joined from H to F, when produced, will meet HC (i. 34). Therefore two
straight lines will have the same ends; and this is impossible. Therefore a
straight line will not fall into the space between the section and the straight
line CD.

## Proposition 37

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets
the diameter, and from the point of contact to the diameter a straight line is dropped
ordinatewise, then the straight line cut off by the ordinate from the center of the
section with the straight line cut off by the tangent from the center of the section will
contain an area equal to the square on the radius of the section, and with the
straight line between the ordinate and the tangent will contain an area having the
ratio to the square on the ordinate which the transverse has to the upright.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam¬
eter is the straight line AB, and let the straight line CD be drawn tangent, and
let the straight line CE be dropped ordinatewise, and let the point F be the
center.

I say that
rect. DF, FE = sq. FB,
and
rect. DE, EF : sq. EC :: the transverse : the upright.

For since CD touches the section, and CE has been dropped ordinatewise,
hence
AD : DB :: AE : EB (i. 36).
Therefore componendo
AD+DB : DB :: AE+EB : EB.

And let the halves of the antecedents be taken (Eucl. v. 15); in the case of the

hyperbola we shall say: but
half (AE+EB) = FE,
and
half AB = FB;
therefore
FE : EB :: FB : BD.
Therefore convertendo
FE : FB :: FB : FD,

646 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

therefore
rect. EF, FD = sq. FB.
And since
FE : EB :: FB : BD :: AF : BD,
alternately
AF : FE :: DB : BE;
componendo
AE : EF :: DE : EB;
and so
rect. AE, EB = rect. FE, ED.
But
rect. AE, EB : sq. CE :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21);
therefore also
rect. FE, ED : sq. CE :: the transverse : the upright.
And in the case of the ellipse and of the circle we shall say: but
half (AD+DB) = DF,
and
half AB = FB;
therefore
FD : DB :: FB : BE.
Therefore convertendo
DF : FB :: BF : FE.
Therefore
rect. DF, FE = sq. BF.
But
rect. DF, FE = rect. DE, EF + sq. FE (Eucl. ii. 3),
and
sq. BF = rect. AE, EB + sq. FE (Eucl. ii. 5).
Let the common square on EF be subtracted; therefore
rect. DE, EF = rect. AE, EB.
Therefore
rect. DE, EF : sq. CE :: rect. AE, EB : sq. CE.
But
rect. AE, EB : sq. CE :: the transverse : the upright (i. 21).
Therefore
rect. DE, EF : sq. CE :: the transverse : the upright.

## Proposition 38

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets
the second diameter, and from the point of contact a straight line is dropped to the
same diameter parallel to the other diameter, then the straight line cut off by the
dropped straight (*katêgmenê*) line from the center of the section with the straight

^1 When this word *katêgmenê* is used in connection with the first diameter we translate it as
“ordinate,” but we have preferred to stick more closely to the original when it is referred
to the second diameter. For, although it is certainly an ordinate in the case of the ellipse, yet
in the case of the hyperbola it is only analogically an ordinate. This analogy, however, be¬
comes stronger and stronger as the treatise moves on. It is, therefore, no accident that
*katêgmenê* is used in both cases. On the other hand in First Definitions, i. 5, Apollonius defi¬
nitely calls both cases ordinates as if announcing the culmination of an analogy to be worked
out in the course of the treatise.

CONICS I 647

line cut off by the tangent from the center of the section will contain an area equal
to the square on the half of the second diameter, and with the straight line between
the dropped straight line and the tangent will contain an area having a ratio to the
square on the dropped straight line which the upright side of the figure has to the
transverse.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam¬
eter is the straight line AGB, and whose second diameter is the straight line
CGD, and let the straight line ELF, meeting CD at F, be a tangent to the
section, and let the straight line HE be parallel to AB.

I say that
rect. FG, GH = sq. GC,
and
rect. GH, HF : sq. HE :: the upright : the transverse.

Let the straight line ME be drawn ordinatewise; therefore
rect. GM, ML : sq. ME :: the transverse : the upright (i. 37).

But
the transverse BA : CD :: CD : the upright (see Def. 11);
and therefore
the transverse : the upright :: sq. BA : sq. CD (Eucl. vi. 20);
and as the quarters of them, that is
the transverse : the upright :: sq. GA : sq. GC;
therefore also
rect. GM, ML : sq. ME :: sq. GA : sq. GC.
But
rect. GM, ML : sq. ME comp. GM : ME, LM : ME,
or
rect. GM, ML : sq. ME comp. GM : GH, LM : ME.

648 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

Therefore inversely
sq. CG : sq. GA comp. EM : MG or HG : GM, EM : ML or FG : GL.
Therefore
sq. GC : sq. GA comp. HG : GM, FG : GL,
which is the same as
rect. FG, GH : rect. MG, GL.
Therefore
rect. FG, GH : rect. MG, GL :: sq. CG : sq. GA.
And alternately therefore
rect. FG, GH : sq. CG :: rect. MG, GL : sq. GA.
But
rect. MG, GL = sq. GA (i. 37),
therefore also
rect. FG, GH = sq. CG.

Again since
the upright : the transverse :: sq. EM : rect. GM, ML (i. 37),
and
sq. EM : rect. GM, ML comp. EM : GM, EM : ML
or
sq. EM : rect. GM, ML comp. HG : HE, FG : GL or FH : HE
which is the same as
rect. FH, HG : sq. HE;
therefore
rect. FH, HG : sq. HE :: the upright : the transverse.

With the same things supposed, it remains to be shown that, as the straight
line between the tangent and the end of the (second) diameter on the same
side with the dropped straight line is to the straight line between the tangent
and the second diameter, so is the straight line between the other end and the
dropped straight line to the straight line between the first end and the dropped
straight line.

For since
rect. FG, GH = sq. GC = rect. CG, GD (2 paragraphs above),
for
CG = GD,
therefore
rect. FG, GH = rect. CG, GD;
therefore
FG : GD :: CG : GH.
And convertendo
GF : FD :: GC : CH.
And let the doubles of the antecedents be taken; but
2GF = CF+FD
because
CG = GD,
and
2GC = CD;
therefore
CF+FD : FD :: DC : CH.

CONICS I 649

And separando
CF : FD :: DH : HC;
and this was to be shown.

Then it is clear from what has been said that the straight line EF touches
the section, either if
rect. FG, GH = sq. GC,
or if
rect. FH, HG : sq. GC
in the ratio we said; for it could be shown conversely.

## Proposition 39

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets
the diameter, and from the point of contact a straight line is dropped ordinatewise
to the diameter, then whichever of the two straight lines is taken of which one is the
straight line between the ordinate and the center of the section, and the other is
between the ordinate and the tangent, then the ordinate will have to it the ratio com¬
pounded of the ratio of the other of the two straight lines to the ordinate and of the
ratio of the upright side of the figure to the transverse.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam¬
eter is the straight line AB, and let the center of it be the point F, and let the
straight line CD be drawn tangent to the section, and the straight line CE be
dropped ordinatewise.

I say that
CE : FE comp. the upright : the transverse, ED : EC,
and
CE : ED comp. the upright : the transverse, FE : EC.

For let
rect. FE, ED = rect. EC, G.

And since
rect. FE, ED : sq. CE :: the transverse : the upright (i. 37),

650 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

and
rect. FE, ED = rect. CE, G,
therefore
rect. CE, G : sq. CE :: G : CE :: the transverse : the upright.
And since
rect. FE, ED = rect. CE, G,
hence
FE : EC :: G : ED.
And since
CE : ED comp. CE : G, G : ED,
but
CE : G :: the upright : the transverse,
therefore
CE : ED comp. the upright : the transverse, FE : EC.

## Proposition 40

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets
the second diameter, and from the point of contact a straight line is dropped to the
same diameter parallel to the other diameter, then whichever of the two straight lines
is taken of which one is the straight line between the dropped straight line and the
center of the section, and the other is between the dropped straight line and the

tangent, the dropped straight line will have to it the ratio compounded of the ratio
of the transverse side to the upright and of the ratio of the other of the two straight
lines to the dropped straight line.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle AB, and its
diameter the straight line BFC, and its second diameter the straight line DFE,
and let the straight line HLA be drawn tangent, and the straight line AG
parallel to the straight line BC.

CONICS I 651

I say that
AG : HG comp. the transverse : the upright, FG : GA,
and
AG : FG comp. the transverse : the upright, HG : GA.

Let
rect. GA, K = rect. HG, GF.
And since
the upright : the transverse :: rect. HG, GF : sq. GA (i. 38),
and
rect. GA, K = rect. HG, GF,
therefore also
rect. GA, K : sq. GA :: K : AG :: the upright : the transverse.
And since
AG : GF comp. AG : K, K : GF,
but
AG : K :: the transverse : the upright,
and
K : GF :: HG : GA
because
rect. HG, GF = rect. AG, K,
therefore
AG : GF comp. the transverse : the upright, GH : GA.

## Proposition 41

If in an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle a straight line is dropped
ordinatewise to the diameter, and equiangular parallelogrammic figures are de¬
scribed both on the ordinate and on the radius, and the ordinate side has to the
remaining side of the figure the ratio compounded of the ratio of the radius to the
remaining side of its figure, and of the ratio of the upright side of the section's
figure to the transverse, then the figure on the straight line between the center and the
ordinate, similar to the figure on the radius, is in the case of the hyperbola greater
than the figure on the ordinate by the figure on the radius, and, in the case of the
ellipse and circumference of a circle, together with the figure on the ordinate is
equal to the figure on the radius.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diam¬
eter is the straight line AB, and center the point E, and let the straight line
CD be dropped ordinatewise, and on the straight lines EA and CD let the
equiangular figures AF and DG be described, and let
CD : CG comp. AE : EF, the upright : the transverse.

I say that, with the figure on ED similar to AF, in the base of the hyperbola,
figure on ED = AF + GD,
and in the case of the ellipse and circle,
figure on ED + GD = AF.

For let it be contrived that
the upright : the transverse :: DC : CH.
And since
DC : CH :: the upright : the transverse,
but
DC : CH :: sq. DC : rect. DC, CH

652 APOLLONIUS OF PERGA

and
the upright : the transverse :: sq. DC : rect. BD, DA (i. 21),

therefore
rect. BD, DA = rect. DC, CH.
And since
DC : CG comp. AE : EF, the upright : the transverse
or
DC : CG comp. AE : EF, DC : CH,
and further
DC : CG comp. DC : CH, CH : CG,
therefore
ratio comp. AE : EF, DC : CH = ratio comp. DC : CH, CH : CG.
Let the common ratio, DC : CH, be taken away; therefore
AE : EF :: CH : CG.
But
HC : CG :: rect. HC, CD : rect. GC, CD,
and
AE : EF :: sq. AE : rect. AE, EF;

CONICS I 653

therefore
rect. HC, CD : rect. GC, CD :: sq. AE : rect. AE, EF.
And it has been shown that
rect. HC, CD = rect. BD, DA;
therefore
rect. BD, DA : rect. GC, CD :: sq. AE : rect. AE, EF.
Alternately
rect. BD, DA : sq. AE :: rect. GC, CD : rect. AE, EF.
And
rect. GC, CD : rect. AE, EF :: pllg. DG : pllg. FA;
for they are equiangular and have to one another the ratio compounded of
their sides, GC : AE and CD : EF (Eucl. vi. 23); and therefore
rect. BD, DA : sq. EA :: pllg. DG : pllg. FA.

Moreover in the case of the hyperbola we are to say: componendo
rect. BD, DA + sq. AE : sq. AE :: pllg. GD + pllg. AF : pllg. AF,
or
sq. DE : sq. EA :: pllg. GD + pllg. AF : pllg. AF (Eucl. ii. 6).
And as the square on DE is to the square on EA, so is the figure described on
ED, similar and similarly situated to the parallelogram AF, to the parallelogram
AF (Eucl. vi. 20, porism); therefore, with the figure on ED similar to the
parallelogram AF,
pllg. GD + pllg. AF : pllg. AF :: figure on ED : pllg. AF.
Therefore
figure on ED = pllg. GD + pllg. AF,
the figure on ED being similar to the parallelogram AF.

And in the case of the ellipse and of the circumference of a circle we shall
say: since then
whole sq. AE : whole pllg. AF ::
rect. AD, DB subtracted : pllg. DG subtracted,
also remainder is to remainder as whole to whole (Eucl. v. 19).

And
sq. AE - rect. BD, DA = sq. DE (Eucl. ii. 5);
therefore
sq. DE : pllg. AF - pllg. DG :: sq. AE : pllg. AF.
But
sq. AE : pllg. AF :: sq. DE : figure on DE (Eucl. vi. 20, porism)
the figure on DE being similar to the parallelogram AF. Therefore, the figure
on DE being similar to the parallelogram AF,
sq. DE : pllg. AF - DG :: sq. DE : figure on DE.
Therefore, the figure on DE being similar to the parallelogram AF,
figure on DE = pllg. AF - pllg. DG.
Therefore
figure on DE + pllg. DG = pllg. AF.

## Proposition 42

If a straight line touching a parabola meets the diameter, and from the point of
contact a straight line is dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, and, some point
being taken on the section, two straight lines are dropped to the diameter, one of
them parallel to the tangent, and the other parallel to the straight line dropped from

APOLLONIUS OF PERGA 654

the point of contact, then the triangle resulting from them is equal to the parallelo¬
gram contained by the straight line dropped from the point of contact and by the
straight line cut off by the parallel from the vertex of the section.

Let there be a parabola, whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let the
straight line AC be drawn tangent to the section, and let the straight line CH
be dropped ordinatewise, and from some point at random let the straight line
DF be dropped ordinatewise, and through the point D let the straight line DE
be drawn parallel to the straight line AC, and through the point C the straight
line CG parallel to the straight line BF, and through the point B the straight
line BG parallel to the straight line HC.

I say that
trgl. DEF = pllg. GF.

For since the straight line AC touches the section, and the straight line CH has been dropped ordinatewise,

AB = BH (i. 35);

therefore

AH = 2BH.

Therefore

triangle AHC = parallelogram BC (Eucl. i. 41).

And since

sq. CH : sq. DF :: HB : BF
because of the section (i. 20), but

sq. CH : sq. DF :: triangle ACH : triangle EDF (Eucl. vi. 19),

and

HB : BF :: parallelogram GH : parallelogram GF (Eucl. vi. 1),

therefore

triangle ACH : triangle EDF :: parallelogram HG : parallelogram FG.
Therefore alternately

triangle AHC : parallelogram BC :: triangle EDF : parallelogram GF.

But

triangle ACH = parallelogram GH;

therefore

triangle EDF = parallelogram GF.

## Proposition 43

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets the diameter, and from the point of contact a straight line is dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, and a parallel to it is drawn through the vertex meeting the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, and, some point being taken on the section, two straight lines are drawn to the diameter, one of which is parallel to the tangent and the other parallel to the straight line dropped from the point of contact, then the triangle resulting from them, in the case of the hyperbola, will be less than the triangle the straight line through the center and the point of contact cuts off, by the triangle on the radius similar to the triangle cut off; and in the case of the ellipse and the circumference of the circle, together with the triangle cut off from the center, will be equal to the triangle on the radius similar to the triangle cut off.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diameter is the straight line AB, and center the point C, and let the straight line DE be drawn tangent to the section, and let the straight line CE be joined, and let the straight line EF be dropped ordinatewise, and let some point G be taken on the section, and let the straight line GH be drawn parallel to the tangent, and let the straight line GK be dropped ordinatewise, and through B let the straight line BL be erected ordinatewise.

I say that triangle KMC differs from triangle CLB by triangle GKH.

For since the straight line ED touches, and the straight line EF has been dropped, hence

EF : FD *compounded of* CF : FE and the upright : the transverse (i. 39).

But

EF : FD :: GK : KH,

and

CF : FE :: CB : BL (Eucl. vi. 4);

therefore

GK : KH *compounded of* BC : BL and the upright : the transverse.

And through those things shown in the forty-first theorem (i. 41), triangle CKM differs from triangle BCL by triangle GHK; for the same things have also been shown in the case of the parallelograms, their doubles.

## Proposition 44

If a straight line touching one of the opposite sections meets the diameter, and from the point of contact some straight line is dropped ordinatewise to the diameter, and a parallel to it is drawn through the vertex of the other section meeting the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, and, some point being taken at random on the section, let straight lines be dropped to the diameter, one of which is parallel to the tangent and the other parallel to the straight line dropped ordinatewise from the point of contact, then the triangle resulting from them will be less than the triangle the dropped straight line cuts off from the center of the section, by the triangle on the radius similar to the triangle cut off.

Let there be the opposite sections AF and BE, and let their diameter be the straight line AB, and center the point C, and from some point F of those on the section FA let the straight line FG be drawn tangent to the section, and the straight line FO ordinatewise, and let the straight line CF be joined and produced, as CE (i. 29), and through B let the straight line BL be drawn parallel to the straight line FO, and let some point N be taken on the section BE, and from N let the straight line NH be dropped ordinatewise, and let the straight line NK be drawn parallel to the straight line FG.

I say that

triangle NKH + triangle CBL = triangle CMH.

For through E let the straight line ED be drawn tangent to the section BE, and let the straight line EX be drawn ordinatewise. Since then FA and BE are opposite sections whose diameter is AB, and the straight line through their center is FCE, and FG and ED are tangents to the section, hence DE is parallel to FG.
> Eutocius, commenting, says: “For since AF is an hyperbola, and FG a tangent, and FO an ordinate, rect. *OC,CG* = sq. *CA* (i. 37) likewise then also rect. *XC, CD* = sq. *CB*. Therefore rect. *OC, CG* : sq. *AC* :: rect. *XC, CD* : sq. *BC*, and alternately, rect. *OC, CG* : rect. *XC, CD* :: sq. *AC* : sq. *CB*. But sq. *AC* = sq. *CB*; therefore also rect. *OC, CG* = rect. *XC, CD*. And *OC* = *CX* (i. 14, 30); and therefore *GC* = *CD*; and also *FC* = *CE* (i. 30); therefore *FC* = *EC*, *CG* = *CD*. And they contain equal angles at the point C; for they are vertical. And so also *FG* = *ED* and angle *CFG* = angle *CED*. And they are alternate; therefore the straight line FG is parallel to the straight line ED.”

And the straight line NK is parallel to FG; therefore NK is also parallel to ED, and the straight line NH to BL. Since then BE is an hyperbola, whose diameter is the straight line AB, and whose center is C, and the straight line DE is tangent to the section, and EX drawn ordinatewise, and BL is parallel to EX, and N has been taken on the section as the point from which NH has been dropped ordinatewise, and NK has been drawn parallel to DE, therefore

triangle NHK + triangle CBL = triangle CMH;
for this has been shown in the forty-third theorem (i. 43).

## Proposition 45

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets the second diameter, and from the point of contact some straight line is dropped to the same diameter parallel to the other diameter, and through the point of contact and the center a straight line is produced, and, some point being taken at random on the section, two straight lines are drawn to the second diameter one of which is parallel to the tangent and the other parallel to the dropped straight line, then the triangle resulting from them is greater, in the case of the hyperbola, than the triangle the dropped straight line cuts off from the center, by the triangle whose base is the tangent and vertex is the center of the section, and, in the case of the ellipse and the circumference of the circle, together with the triangle cut off from the center, will be equal to the triangle whose base is the tangent and whose vertex is the center of the section.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle ABC, whose diameter is the straight line AH, and second diameter HD, and center H, and let the straight line CML touch it at C, and let the straight line CD be drawn parallel to AH, and let the straight line HC be joined and produced, and let some point B be taken at random on the section, and from B let the straight lines BE and BF be drawn parallel to the straight lines LC and CD.

I say that, in the case of the hyperbola,

triangle BEF = triangle GHF + triangle LCH,
and, in the case of the ellipse and circle,

triangle BEF + triangle FGH = triangle CLH.

For let the straight lines CK and BN be drawn parallel to DH. Since then the straight line CM is tangent, and the straight line CK has been dropped ordinatewise, hence

CK : KH *compounded of* MK : KC and the upright : the transverse (i. 39),

and

MK : KC :: CD : DL (Eucl. vi. 4);

therefore

CK : KH *compounded of* CD : DL and the upright : the transverse.

And triangle CDL is the figure on KH; and triangle CKH, that is triangle CDH, is the figure on CK, that is on DH; therefore, in the case of the hyperbola,

triangle CDL = triangle CKH + triangle on AH similar to triangle CDL,
and, in the case of the ellipse and the circle,

triangle CDH + triangle CDL = triangle on AH similar to triangle CDL;
for this was also shown in the case of their doubles in the forty-first theorem (i. 41).

Since then triangle CDL differs either from triangle CKH or from triangle CDH by the triangle on AH similar to triangle CDL, and it also differs by triangle CHL, therefore

triangle CHL = triangle on AH similar to triangle CDL.

Since then triangle BFE is similar to triangle CDL, and triangle GFH to triangle CDH, therefore they have the same ratio.
> That is (Eucl. vi. 4). *BF* : *FE* :: *CD* : *DL* and *GF* : *FH* :: *CD* : *DH* :: *CK* : *KH*. Therefore these first ratios can be substituted in the central proportion of the theorem *CK* : *KH* *compounded of* *CD* : *DL* and the upright : the transverse, and so satisfy i. 41.

And triangle BFE is described on NH between the ordinate and the center, and triangle GFH on the ordinate BN, that is on FH; and by things already shown (i. 41) triangle BFE differs from triangle GHF by the triangle on AH similar to CDL, and so also by triangle CHL.

## Proposition 46

If a straight line touching a parabola meets the diameter, the straight line drawn through the point of contact parallel to the diameter in the direction of the section bisects the straight lines drawn in the section parallel to the tangent.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line ABD, and let the straight line AC touch the section (i. 24), and through C let the straight line HCM be drawn parallel to the straight line AD (i. 26), and let some point L be taken at random on the section, and let the straight line LNFE (i. 18,22) be drawn parallel to AC.

I say that

LN = NF.

Let the straight lines BH, KFG, and LMD be drawn ordinatewise. Since then by the things already shown in the forty-second theorem (i. 42)

triangle DLM = parallelogram BM,

and

triangle EFG = parallelogram BFG,

therefore the remainders

parallelogram GM = quadrilateral LFGD.

Let the common pentagon MDGFN be subtracted; therefore the remainders

triangle KFN = triangle LMN.

And KF is parallel to LM; therefore

FN = LN (Eucl. vi. 22, lemma).

## Proposition 47

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets the diameter, and through the point of contact and the center a straight line is drawn in the direction of the section, it bisects the straight lines drawn in the section parallel to the tangent.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diameter is the straight line AB and center C, and let the straight line DE be drawn tangent to the section, and let the straight line CE be joined and produced, and let a point N be taken at random on the section, and through N let the straight line HNOG be drawn parallel.

I say that

NO = OG.

For let the straight lines *XNF*, *BL*, and *GMK* be dropped ordinatewise. Therefore by things already shown in the forty-third theorem (i. 43)

triangle HNF = quadrilateral LBFX,
and
triangle GHK = quadrilateral LBKM.

Therefore the remainders

quadrilateral NGKF = quadrilateral MKFX;

Let the common pentagon ONFKM be subtracted;
therefore the remainders

triangle OMG = triangle NXO.

And the straight line MG is parallel to the straight line NX; therefore

NO = OG (Eucl. vi. 22, lemma).

## Proposition 48

If a straight line touching one of the opposite sections meets the diameter, and through the point of contact and the center a straight line produced cuts the other section, then whatever line is drawn in the other section parallel to the tangent, will be bisected by the straight line produced.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameter is the straight line AB and center C, and let the straight line KL touch the section A, and let the straight line LC be joined and produced (i. 29), and let some point N be taken on the section B, and through N let the straight line NG be drawn parallel to the straight line LK.

I say that

NO = OG.

For let the straight line ED be drawn through E tangent to the section; therefore ED is parallel to LK (i. 44, note). And so also to NG. Since then BNG is an hyperbola whose center is C and tangent DE, and since CE has been joined and a point N has been taken on the section and through it NG has been drawn parallel to DE, by a theorem already shown (i. 47) for the hyperbola

NO = OG.

## Proposition 49

If a straight line touching a parabola meets the diameter, and through the point of contact a parallel to the diameter is drawn, and from the vertex a straight line is drawn parallel to an ordinate, and it is contrived that as the segment of the tangent between the erected straight line and the point of contact is to the segment of the parallel between the point of contact and the erected straight line, so is some straight line to the double of the tangent, then whatever straight line is drawn [parallel to the tangent] from the section to the straight line drawn through the point of contact parallel to the diameter, will equal in square the rectangle contained by the straight line found and by the straight line cut off by it from the point of contact.

Let there be a parabola whose diameter is the straight line MBC, and CD its tangent, and through D let the straight line FDN be drawn parallel to the straight line BC, and let the straight line FB be erected ordinatewise (i. 17), and let it be contrived that
ED : DF :: some straight line G : 2 CD,
and let some point K be taken on the section, and let the straight line KLP be drawn through K parallel to CD.
I say that
sq. KL = rect. G,DL,
that is, that, with the straight line DL as diameter, the straight line G is the upright side.

For let the straight lines DX and KNM be dropped ordinatewise. And since the straight line CD touches the section, and the straight line DX has been dropped ordinatewise, then

CB = BX (i. 35).

But

BX = FD
and therefore
CB = FD.
And so also
triangle ECB = triangle EFD.

Let the common figure DEBMN be added; therefore

quadrilateral DCMN = parallelogram FM
= triangle KPM (i. 42).

Let the common quadrilateral LPMN be subtracted; therefore the remainders

triangle KLN = parallelogram LC.

And

angle DLP = angle KLN;
therefore
rect. *KL, LN* = 2 rect. *LD,DC*.
> Eutocius, commenting, says: “For let the triangle KLN and the parallelogram DLPC be set out. And since triangle KLN = parallelogram DP, let the straight line NR be drawn through N parallel to LK, and through K, KR parallel to LN; therefore LR is a parallelogram and parallelogram LR = 2 triangle KLN, and so also parallelogram LR = 2 parallelogram DP. Then let the straight lines DC and LP be produced to S and T, and let CS be made equal to DC, and PT to LP, and let ST be joined; therefore parallelogram DP = 2 parallelogram DP; and so parallelogram LR = parallelogram LS. But it is also equiangular with it because of the angles at L being vertical; but in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; therefore *KL* : *LT* or *DS* :: *DL* : *LN*; and rect. *KL,LN* = rect. *LD,DS*. And since *DS* = 2 *DC*, hence rect. *KL, LN* = 2 rect. *LD, DC*.
> “And if DC is parallel to LP, and CP is not parallel to LD, it is clear DC PL is a trapezoid, and so I say that rect. *KL,LN* = rect. *DL, CD+LP*. For if LP is filled out, as we have said before, and the straight lines DC and LP are produced, and CS is made equal to LP, and PT to DC, and the straight line ST is joined, then parallelogram DT = 2DP; and the same demonstration will fit. And this will be useful in what follows (i. 50).”

And since
ED : DF :: G : 2CD,
and
ED : DF :: KL : LN,
therefore also
G : 2CD :: KL : LN.

But
KL : LN :: sq. KL : rect. *KL, LN*,
and
G : 2CD :: rect. *G,DL* : 2rect. *LD,DC*;

therefore

sq. KL : rect. *KL,LN* :: rect. *G,DL* : 2rect. *CD,DL*.
And alternately; but

rect. *KL, LN* = 2rect. *CD,DL*;

therefore also

sq. KL = rect. *G,DL*.

## Proposition 50

If a straight line touching an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle meets the diameter, and a straight line is produced through the point of contact and the center, and from the vertex a straight line erected parallel to an ordinate meets the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, and if it is contrived that as the segment of the tangent between the point of contact and the straight line erected is to the segment of the straight line, drawn through the point of contact and the center, between the point of contact and the straight line erected, so some straight line is to the double of the tangent, then whatever straight line is drawn from the section to the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, parallel to the tangent, will equal in square a rectangular area applied to the straight line found, having as breadth the straight line cut off by it from the point of contact, and exceeding, in the case of the hyperbola, by a figure similar to the rectangle contained by the double of the straight line between the center and the point of contact and by the straight line found; but in the case of the ellipse and circle, defective by it.

Let there be an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diameter is the straight line AB, and center C, and let the straight line DE be a tangent, and let the straight line CE be joined and produced both ways, and let the straight line CK be made equal to the straight line EC, and through B let the straight line BFG be erected ordinatewise, and through E let the straight line EH be drawn perpendicular to EC, and let it be that
FE : EG :: EH : 2 ED,

and let the straight line HK be joined and produced, and let some point L be taken on the section, and through it let the straight line LMX be drawn parallel to ED, and the straight line LRN parallel to BG, and the straight line MP parallel to EH.

I say that

sq. LM = rect. *EM,MP*.

For let the straight line CSO be drawn through C parallel to KP. And since

EC = CK,

and

EC : KC :: ES : SH
therefore also
ES = SH.

And since

FE : EG :: HE : 2 ED,

and

2 ES = EH,

therefore also

FE : EG :: SE : ED.

And

FE : EG :: LM : MR;

therefore

LM : MR :: SE : ED.

And since it was shown (I. 43) that, in the case of the hyperbola,

triangle RNC = triangle LNX + triangle GBC,
= triangle LNX + triangle CDE,
> That triangle *GBC* = triangle *CDE* is proved by Apollonius in the course of another proof of i. 43, reported by Eutocius. It is also proved in iii. 1, without the help of intervening propositions.

and, in the case of the ellipse and circle,

triangle RNC + triangle LNX = triangle GBC
= triangle CDE;

therefore, in the case of the hyperbola with the common triangle ECD and the common quadrilateral NRMX subtracted, and in the case of the ellipse and circle with the common triangle MXC subtracted,
> The position of point L furnishes different cases which at times, as in the present theorem, require a change in the course of the proof. The figures marked “Cases I” are drawn to fit the proof as set down, but we have added figures marked “Cases II” as an example of the possible differences.
> For the hyperbola of Case II, instead of the subtraction in the theorem above, we have
> triangle RNC = triangle LNX + triangle CDE
> quadrilateral MCNL = quadrilateral MCNL.
> Subtracting the first equals from the second identity, we have
> triangle LMR = quadrilateral MEDX.
> The rest of the proof is the same.
> For the ellipse and circle of Case II, we have as in the theorem above
> triangle RNC + triangle LNX = triangle CDE,
> and subtracting the common triangle CMX,
> triangle LMR = triangle CDE - triangle CMX;
> therefore rect. *LM,MR* = rect. *EM,ED* + *MX*.
> For let CM be made equal to CM' and CX to CX'. Then
> triangle CDF - triangle CMX = quadrilateral M'EDX',
> and M'X' is parallel to ED, and
> angle EM'X' = angle RML.
> These cases will come up again in Book III, and in general it is convenient to think of quadrilateral MEDX as standing for the difference of the two triangles when one pair of its sides cross each other.

triangle LMR = quadrilateral MEDX.

And MX is parallel to DE, and

angle LMR = angle EMX;

therefore

rect. *LM,MR* = rect. *EM,ED* + *MX* (i. 49, note, para. 2).
And since

MC : CE :: MX : ED

and

MC : CE :: MO : ES
therefore
MO : ES :: MX : ED
And *componendo*
MO+ES : ES :: MX+ED : ED
alternately
MO+ES : MX+ED :: ES : ED
But
MO+ES : MX+ED :: rect. *MO+ES,ME* : rect. *MX+ED, EM*,
and
ES : ED :: LM : MR :: FE : EG (Eucl. vi. 4)
or
ES : ED :: sq. LM : rect. *LM,MR*;

therefore

rect. *MO+ES, ME* : rect. *MX+ED, EM* :: sq. LM : rect. *LM,MR*.
And alternately

rect. *MO+ES, ME* : sq. LM :: rect. *MX+ED, EM* : rect. *LM, MR*.

But

rect. *LM,MR* = rect. *ME, MX+ED* (above);

therefore

sq. LM = rect. *EM, MO+ES*.

And

SE = SH,

and

SH = OP;

therefore

sq. LM = rect. *EM,MP*.

## Proposition 51

If a straight line touching either of the opposite sections meets the diameter, and through the point of contact and the center some straight line is produced to the other section, and from the vertex a straight line is erected parallel to an ordinate and meets the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, and if it is contrived that, as the segment of the tangent between the straight line erected and the point of contact is to the segment of the straight line, drawn through the point of contact and the center, between the point of contact and the straight line erected, so is some straight line to the double of the tangent, then whatever straight line in the other of the sections is drawn to the straight line through the point of contact and the center, parallel to the tangent, will equal in square the rectangle applied to the straight line found, having as breadth the straight line cut off by it from the point of contact and exceeding by a figure similar to the rectangle contained by the straight line between the opposite sections and the straight line found.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameter is the straight line AB and center E, and let the straight line CD be drawn tangent to the section B and the straight line CE joined and produced (i. 29), and let the straight line BLG be drawn ordinatewise (i. 17), and let it be contrived that
LC : CG :: some straight line K : 2 CD.

Now it is evident that the straight lines in the section BC, parallel to CD and drawn to EC produced are equal in square to the areas applied to K, having as breadths the straight line cut off by them from the point of contact, and exceeding by a figure similar to the rectangle *CF, K*; for

FC = 2CE.

I say then that in section FA the same thing will come about.

For let the straight line MF be drawn through F tangent to the section AF, and let the straight line AXN be erected ordinatewise. And since BC and AF are opposite sections, and CD and MF are tangents to them, therefore CD is equal and parallel to MF (i. 44, note). But also

CE = EF;

therefore also

ED = EM.

And since

LC : CG :: K : 2 CD or 2MF,

therefore also

XF : FN :: K : 2 MF.

Since then AF is an hyperbola whose diameter is AB and tangent MF, and AN has been drawn ordinatewise, and

XF : FN :: K : 2FM,

hence any lines drawn from the section to EF produced, parallel to FM, will equal in square the rectangle contained by the straight line K and the line cut off by them from F, exceeding by a figure similar to the rectangle *CF, K* (i. 50).

And with these things shown, it is at once evident that in the parabola each of the straight lines drawn off parallel to the original diameter is a diameter (i. 46), but in the hyperbola and ellipse and opposite sections each of the straight lines drawn through the center is a diameter (i. 47-48); and that in the parabola the straight lines dropped to each of the diameters parallel to the tangents will equal in square the rectangles applied to it (i. 49), but in the hyperbola and opposite sections they will equal in square the areas applied to it and exceeding by the same figure (i. 50-51), but in the ellipse the areas applied to it and defective by the same figure (i. 50); and that all the things which have been already proved about the sections as following when the principal diameters are used,
> The principal diameter (διάμετρος ἀρχή) is that whose being is established in i. 7, porism.

will also, those very same things, follow when the other diameters are taken.

## Proposition 52 (Problem)

Given a straight line in a plane bounded at one point, to find in the plane the section of a cone called parabola, whose diameter is the given straight line, and whose vertex is the end of the straight line, and where whatever straight line is dropped from the section to the diameter at a given angle, will equal in square the rectangle contained by the straight line cut off by it from the vertex of the section and by some other given straight line.

Let there be the straight line AB given in position and bounded at the point A, and another straight line CD given in magnitude, and first let the given angle be a right angle; it is required then to find a parabola in the plane of reference whose diameter is the straight line AB and whose vertex is the point A, and whose upright side is the straight line CD, and where the straight lines dropped ordinatewise will be dropped at a right angle, that is so that AB is the axis (First Def. i. 7).

Let AB be produced to D, and let CG be taken as the fourth part of CD, and let

EA > CG,

and let

CD : H :: H : EA.

Therefore

CD : EA :: sq. H : sq. EA,
and
CD < 4EA;
therefore also
sq. H < 4 sq. EA.

Therefore

H < 2EA;

and so the two straight lines EA are greater than H. It is therefore possible for a triangle to be constructed from H and two straight lines EA. Then let the triangle EAF be constructed on EA at right angles to the plane of reference so that

EA = AF,

and

H = FE,

and let the straight line AK be drawn parallel to FE, and FK to EA, and let a cone be conceived whose vertex is the point F and whose base is the circle about diameter KA, at right angles to the plane through AFK. Then the cone will be a right cone (First Def. i. 3); for

AF = FK.

And let the cone be cut by a plane parallel to the circle KA, and let it make as a section the circle MNX (i. 4), at right angles clearly to the plane through MFN, and let the straight line MN be the common section of the circle MNX and of the triangle MFN; therefore it is the diameter of the circle. And let the

The straight line XL be the common section of the plane of reference and of the circle. Since then circle MNX is at right angles to triangle MFN, and the plane of reference also at right angles to triangle MFN, therefore the straight line LX, their common section, is at right angles to triangle MFN, that is to triangle KFA (Eucl. XI. 19); and therefore it is perpendicular to all the straight lines touching it and in the triangle; and so it is perpendicular to both MN and AB.

Again since a cone, whose base is the circle MNX and whose vertex is the point F, has been cut by a plane at right angles to the triangle MFN and makes as a section circle MNX, and since it has also been cut by another plane, the plane of reference, cutting the base of the cone in a straight line XL at right angles to MN which is the common section of the circle MNX and the triangle MFN, and the common section of the plane of reference and of the triangle MFN, the straight line AB, is parallel to the side of the cone FKM, therefore the resulting section of the cone in the plane of reference is a parabola, and its diameter AB (I. 11), and the straight lines dropped ordinate-wise from the section to AB will be dropped at right angles; for they are parallel to XL which is perpendicular to AB. And since

CD : H :: H : EA,

and

EA = AF = FK

and

H = EF = AK,

therefore

CD : AK :: AK : AF.

And therefore

CD : AF :: sq. AK : sq. AF or rect. AF, FK.

Therefore CD is the upright side of the section; for this has been shown in the eleventh theorem (I. 11).

## Proposition 53 (Problem)

With the same things supposed, let the given angle not be right, and let the angle HAE be made equal to it and let

AH = half CD,

and from H let the straight line HE be drawn perpendicular to AE, and through E let the straight line EL be drawn parallel to BH, and from A let the straight line AL be drawn perpendicular to EL, and let EL be bisected at K, and from K let the straight line KM be drawn perpendicular to EL and produced to F and G, and let rect. LK, KM = sq. AL. And given the two straight lines LK and KM, KL in position and bounded at K, and KM in magnitude, and let a parabola be described with a right angle whose diameter is the straight line KL, and whose vertex is the point K, and whose upright side is the straight line KM, as has been shown before (I. 52); and it will pass through the point A because
sq. AL = rect. LK, KM (I. 11),
and the straight line EA will touch the section because

EK = KL (I. 33).

And HA is parallel to EKL; therefore HAB is the diameter of the section, and the straight lines dropped to it parallel to AE will be bisected by AB (I. 46). And they will be dropped at angle HAE. And since

angle AEH = angle AGF,

and angle at A is common, therefore triangle AHE is similar to triangle AGF.
Therefore

EA : HA :: FA : AG.

Therefore

2 AH : 2 AE :: FA : AG.

But

CD = 2AH;

therefore

FA : AG :: CD : 2 AE.

Then by things already shown in the forty-ninth theorem (I. 49) the straight line CD is the upright side.

## Proposition 54

Given two bounded straight lines perpendicular to each other, one of them being produced on the side of the right angle, to find on the straight line produced the section of a cone called hyperbola in the same plane with the straight lines, so that the straight line produced is a diameter of the section and the point at the angle is the vertex, and where whatever straight line is dropped from the section to the diameter, making an angle equal to the given angle, will equal in square the rectangle applied to the other straight line having as breadth the straight line cut off by the dropped straight line beginning with the vertex and exceeding by a figure similar and similarly situated to that contained by the original straight lines.

Let there be the two bounded straight lines AB and BC perpendicular to each other, and let AB be produced to D; it is required then to find in the plane through the lines AB, BC an hyperbola whose diameter will be the straight line ABD and vertex B, and upright side the straight line BC, and where the straight lines dropped from the section to BD at the given angle will equal in square the rectangles applied to BC having as breadths the straight lines cut off by them from B and exceeding by a figure similar and similarly situated to the rectangle AB, BC.

First let the given angle be a right angle, and on AB let a plane be erected at right angles to the plane of reference, and let the circle AEBF be described in it about AB, so that the segment of the circle's diameter within the sector AEB has to the segment of the diameter within the sector AFB a ratio not greater than that of AB to BC,¹ and let AEB be bisected at E, and let the straight line

¹Eutocius, commenting, adds: “Let there be two straight lines AB and BC, and let it be required to describe a circle on AB so that its diameter is cut by AB in such a way that the part of it on the side of C has to the remainder a ratio not greater than that of AB to BC.

“Now let it be supposed that they have the same ratio, and let AB be bisected at D, and through it let the straight line EDF be drawn perpendicular to AB, and let it be contrived that AB : BC :: ED : DF, and let EF be bisected; then it is clear that if AB = BC and ED = DF, the point D will be the midpoint of EF, and if AB > BC and ED > DF, the midpoint will be below D, and if

F

AB < BC,

it will be above D.

“And now let it be below as G, and with center G and radius GF let a circle be described; then it will have to pass either within or without the points A and B. And if it should pass through the points A and B, what was enjoined would be done; but let it fall beyond the points A and B, and let the straight line AB, produced both ways, meet the circumference at H and K, and let FH, HE, EK and KF be joined, and let MB be drawn through B parallel to FK, and BL parallel to KE, and let MA and AL be joined; then these will also be parallel to FH and HE because AD = DB and DH = DK and FDE is perpendicular to HK. And since the angle at K is a right angle, and MB and BL are parallel to FK and KE, therefore the angle at B is a right angle; then for the same reasons also the angle at A. And so the circle described on ML will pass through the points A and B (Eucl. III. 31). Let the circle MALB be described. And since MB is parallel to FK,

FD : DM :: KD : DB.

Then likewise also KD : DB :: ED : DL.

And therefore FD : DM :: ED : DL.

And alternately, ED : DF :: AB : BC :: LD : DM.

“And likewise if the circle described on FE cuts AB, the same thing could be shown.”

EK be drawn perpendicular from E to the straight line AB and let it be produced to L; therefore the straight line EL is a diameter (Eucl. III. 1). If then

AB : BC :: EK : KL

we use point L, but if not, let it be contrived that

AB : BC :: EK : KM

with

KM < KL (Eucl. V. 8),

and through M let MF be drawn parallel to AB, and let AF, EF, and FB be joined, and through B let BX be drawn parallel to FE. Since then

angle AFE = angle EFB,

but

angle AFE = angle AXB,

and

angle EFB = angle XBF,

therefore also

angle XBF = angle FXB;

therefore also

FB = FX.

Let a cone be conceived whose vertex is the point F and whose base is the circle about diameter BX at right angles to triangle BFX. Then the cone will be a right cone; for

FB = FX.

Then let the straight lines BF, FX, and MF be produced, and let the cone be cut by a plane parallel to the circle BX; then the section will be a circle (I. 4). Let it be the circle GPR; and so GH will be the diameter of the circle (I. 4, end). And let the straight line PDR be the common section of circle GH and of the plane of reference; then PDR will be perpendicular to both of the straight lines GH and DB; for both of the circles XB and HG are perpendicular to triangle FGH, and the plane of reference is perpendicular to triangle FGH; and therefore their common section the straight line PDR is perpendicular to triangle FGH; therefore it makes right angles also with all the straight lines touching it and in the same plane.

And since a cone whose base is circle GH and vertex F, has been cut by a plane perpendicular to triangle FGH, and has also been cut by another plane, the plane of reference, in the straight line PDR perpendicular to the straight line GDH, and the common section of the plane of reference and of triangle GFH, that is the straight line DB, produced in the direction of B, meets the straight line GF at A, therefore by things already shown before (I. 12) the section PBR will be an hyperbola whose vertex is the point B, and where the straight lines dropped ordinate-wise to BD will be dropped at a right angle; for they are parallel to straight line PDR. And since

AB : BC :: EK : KM,

and

EK : KM :: EN : NF :: rect. EN, NF : sq. NF,

Therefore

AB : BC :: rect. EN, NF : sq. NF.

And

rect. EN, NF = rect. AN, NB;

therefore

AB : BC :: rect. AN, NB : sq. NF.

But

rect. AN, NB : sq. NF comp. AN : NF, BN : NF;

but

AN : NF :: AD : DG :: FO : OG,

and

BN : NF :: FO : OH;

therefore

AB : BC comp. FO : OG, FO : OH,

that is

sq. FO : rect. OG, OH.

Therefore

AB : BC :: sq. FO : rect. OG, OH.

And the straight line FO is parallel to the straight line AD; therefore the straight line AB is the transverse side, and BC the upright side; for these things have been shown in the twelfth theorem (I. 12).

## Proposition 55 (Problem)

Then let the given angle not be a right angle, and let there be the two given straight lines AB and AC, and let the given angle be equal to angle BAH; then it is required to describe an hyperbola whose diameter will be the straight line AB, and upright side AC, and where the ordinates will be dropped at angle HAB.

Let the straight line AB be bisected at D, and let the semicircle AFD be described on AD, and let some straight line FG, parallel to AH, be drawn to the semicircle making

sq. FG : rect. DG, GA :: AC : AB,¹

¹Eutocius, commenting, gives this construction: “Let there be the semicircle ABC on the diameter AC, and the given ratio EF to FG, and let it be required to do what is proposed.

“Let FH be made equal to EF, and let HG be bisected at K, and let the straight line CB be drawn in the semicircle at angle ACB (the required angle), and from the center L let the straight line LS be drawn perpendicular to it, and produced let it meet the circumference at N, and through N let NM be drawn parallel to CB; therefore it will touch the circle. And let it be contrived that FH : HK :: MX : XN, and let LX = LN, and let the straight lines LX and LO cutting the semicircle at P and R be joined, and let the straight line PRD be joined.

Since then XN = NO, and NL is common and perpendicular, therefore LO = LX. And also LP = LR; and therefore the remainders PO = RX. Therefore PRD is parallel to MO. And FH : HK :: MX : NX; and HK : HG :: NX : XO; therefore ex aequali FH : HG :: MX : XO; inversely HG : FH :: XO : MX; componendo GF : FH :: OM : MX or GF : FE :: PD : DR. And PD : DR :: rect. PD, DR : sq. DR, but rect. PD, DR = rect. AD, DC (Eucl. III. 36); therefore GF : FE :: rect. AD, DC : sq. DR. Therefore inversely FE : GF :: sq. DR : rect. AD, DC”

and let the straight line FHD be joined and produced to D, and let

FD : DL :: DL : DH,

and let DK be made equal to DL, and let

rect. LF, FM = sq. AF,

and let KM be joined, and through L let LN be drawn perpendicular to KF and let it be produced towards X. And with two given bounded straight lines KL and LN perpendicular to each other, let an hyperbola be described whose transverse side is KL, and upright side LN, and where the straight lines dropped from the section to the diameter will be dropped at a right angle and will equal in square the rectangle applied to LN having as breadths the straight lines cut off by them from L and exceeding by a figure similar to rectangle KL, LN (I. 54); and the section will pass through A; for
sq. AF = rect. LF, FM (I. 12).

And AH will touch it; for

rect. FD, DH = sq. DL (I. 37).

And so AB is a diameter of the section (I. 51). And since

CA : 2 AD or AB :: sq. FG : rect. DG, GA,

but

CA : 2 AD comp. CA : 2 AH, 2 AH : 2 AD

or

CA : 2 AD comp. CA : 2 AH, AH : AD

and

AH : AD :: FG : GD,

therefore

CA : AB comp. CA : 2 AH, FG : GD.

But also

sq. FG : rect. DG, GA comp. FG : GD, FG : GA;

therefore

ratio comp. CA : 2 AH, FG : GD = ratio comp. FG : GA, FG : GD.

Let the common ratio FG : GD be taken away; therefore

CA : 2 AH :: FG : GA.

But

FG : GA :: OA : AX,

therefore

CA : 2 AH :: OA : AX.

But whenever this is so, the straight line AC is a parameter; for this has been shown in the fiftieth theorem (I. 50).

## Proposition 56 (Problem)

Given two bounded straight lines perpendicular to each other, to find about one of them as diameter and in the same plane with the two straight lines the section of a cone called ellipse, whose vertex will be the point at the right angle, and where the straight lines dropped ordinate-wise from the section to the diameter at a given angle will equal in square the rectangles applied to the other straight line, having as breadth the straight line cut off by them from the vertex of the section and defective by a figure similar and similarly situated to the rectangle contained by the given straight lines.

Let there be two given straight lines AB and AC perpendicular to each other, of which the greater is the straight line AB; then it is required to describe in the plane of reference an ellipse whose diameter will be the straight line AB and vertex A, and upright side AC, and where the ordinates will be dropped from the section to the diameter at a given angle and will equal in square the rectangles applied to AC having as breadths the straight lines cut off by them from A and defective by a figure similar and similarly situated to rectangle BA, AC.

And first let the given angle be a right angle, and let a plane be erected from AB at right angles to the plane of reference, and in it, on AB, let the sector of a circle ADB be described, and its midpoint be D, and let the straight lines DA and DB be joined, and let the straight line AX be made equal to AC, and through X let the straight line XO be drawn parallel to DB, and through O let OF be drawn parallel to AB, and let DF be joined and let it meet AB produced at E; then we will have

AB : AC :: AB : AX :: DA : AO :: DE : EF.

And let the straight lines AF and FB be joined and produced, and let some point G be taken at random on FA, and through it let the straight line GL be drawn parallel to DE and let it meet AB produced at K; then let FO be produced and let it meet GK at L. Since then

arc AD = arc DB,

angle ABD = angle DFB (Eucl. III. 27).

And since

angle EFA = angle FDA + angle FAD,

but

angle FAD = angle FBD,

and

angle FDA = angle FBA,

therefore also

angle EFA = angle DBA = angle DFB.

And also DE is parallel to LG; therefore

angle EFA = angle FGH,

and

angle DFB = angle FHG.

And so also

angle FGH = angle FHG,

and

FG = FH.

Then let circle GHN be described about HG at right angles to triangle HGF, let a cone be conceived whose base is the circle GHN, and whose vertex is the point F; then the cone will be a right cone because

FG = FH.

And since the circle GHN is at right angles to plane HGF, and the plane of reference is also at right angles to the plane through GH and HF, therefore their common section will be at right angles to the plane through GH and HF. Then let their common section be the straight line KM; therefore the straight line KM is perpendicular to both of the straight lines AK and KG.

And since a cone whose base is the circle GHN, and whose vertex is the point F, has been cut by a plane through the axis and makes as a section triangle GHF, and has been cut also by another plane through AK and KM, which is the plane of reference, in the straight line KM which is perpendicular to GK, and the plane meets the sides of the cone FG and FH, therefore the resulting section is an ellipse whose diameter is AB and where the ordinates will be dropped at a right angle (I. 13); for they are parallel to KM. And since
DE : EF :: rect. DE, EF or rect. BE, EA : sq. EF,

and

rect. BE, EA : sq. EF comp. BE : EF, AE : EF,

but

BE : EF :: BK : KH,

and

AE : EF :: AK : KG :: FL : LG,

therefore

BA : AC comp. FL : LG, FL : LH (see above),

which is the same as

sq. FL : rect. GL, LH;

therefore

BA : AC :: sq. FL : rect. GL, LH.

And whenever this is so, the straight line AC is the upright side of the figure, as has been shown in the thirteenth theorem (I. 13).

## Proposition 57 (Problem)

With the same things supposed let the straight line AB be less than AC, and let it be required to describe an ellipse about diameter AB so that AC is the upright.

Let AS be bisected at D, and from D let the straight line EDF be drawn perpendicular to AS, and let

sq. FS = rect. BA, AC

so that

FD = DE,

and let FG be drawn parallel to AS, and let it be contrived that

AC : AB :: EF : FG;

therefore also

EF > FG.

And since

rect. CA, AS = sq. EF,

hence

CA : AS :: sq. FE : sq. AS :: sq. DF : sq. DA.

But

CA : AB :: EF : FG,

therefore

EF : FG :: sq. FD : sq. DA.

But

sq. SD = rect. FD, DE;

therefore

EF : FG :: rect. ED, DF : sq. AD.

Then with two bounded straight lines situated at right angles to each other and with EF greater, let an ellipse be described whose diameter is EF and upright side FG (I. 56); then the section will pass through A because
rect. FD, DE : sq. DA :: EF : FG (I. 21).

And

AD = DB;

then it will also pass through B. Then an ellipse has been described about AB. And since

CA : AB :: sq. FD : sq. DA,

and

sq. DA = rect. AD, DB,

therefore

CA : AB :: sq. DF : rect. AD, DB.

And so the straight line AC is an upright side (I. 21).

## Proposition 58 (Problem)

But then let the given angle not be a right angle, and let the angle BAD be equal to it, and let the straight line AB be bisected at E, and let the semicircle AFE be described on AE, and in it let the straight line FG be drawn parallel to AD making

sq. FG : rect. AG, GE :: CA : AB,¹

¹Eutocius, commenting, gives this construction: “Let there be the semicircle ABC and within it some straight line AB (at the required angle to AC), and let two unequal straight lines DE and EF be laid down, and let EF be produced to G, and let FG be made equal to DE, and let the whole line EG be bisected at H, and let the center of the circle, K, be taken, and from it let a perpendicular be drawn to AB and let it meet the circumference at L, and through L let LM be drawn parallel to AB, and let KA produced meet LM at M, and let it be contrived that HF : FG :: LM : MN, and let LX = LN, and let the straight lines NK and KX be joined and produced, and let the circle, finished out, cut them at P and O, and let the straight line ORP be joined.

“Since then FH : FG :: LM : MN, componendo HG : GF :: LN : NM; inversely FG : GH :: NM : NL, and FG : GE :: MN : NX; separando FG : FE :: NM : MX. And since NL = LX, and the straight line LK is common and at right angles, therefore also KN = KX. And also KO = KP; therefore NX is parallel to OP. Therefore triangle KMN is similar to triangle OKR and triangle KMX to triangle PRK.

Therefore KM : KR :: MN : RO. But also KM : KR :: MX : PR; and therefore NM : RO :: MX : PR; and alternately NM : MX :: RO : RP. But NM : MX :: GF : FE :: DE : EF, and OR : RP :: sq. OR : rect. OR, RP; and therefore DE : EF :: sq. OR : rect. OR, RP. And rect. OR, RP = rect. AR, RC (Eucl. III. 35). Therefore DE : EF :: sq. OR : rect. AR, RC.”

and let

EK = EH,

and let it be contrived that

rect. HF, FL = sq. AF,

and let the straight line KL be joined, and from H let the straight line HMX be drawn perpendicular to HF and so parallel to the straight line AFL; for the angle at F is right. And with the two given bounded straight lines KH, and HM perpendicular to each other, let an ellipse be described whose transverse diameter is KH, and the upright side of whose figure is HM, and where the ordinates to HK will be dropped at right angles (I. 56-57); then the section will pass through A because sq. FA = rect. HF, FL (I. 13). And since

HE = EK,

and

AE = EB,

the section will also pass through B, and E will be the center, and the straight line AEB the diameter. And the straight line DA will touch the section because

rect. DE, EF = sq. EH.

And since

CA : AB :: sq. FG : rect. AG, GE,

but

CA : AB comp. CA : 2 AD, 2 AD : AB or DA : AE,

and

sq. FG = rect. AG, GE comp. FG : GE, FG : GA,

therefore

ratio comp. CA : 2 AD, DA : AE = ratio comp. FG : GE, FG : GA.

But

DA : AE :: FG : GE;

and the common ratio being taken away, we will have

CA : 2 AD :: FG : GA

or

CA : 2 AD :: XA : AN.

And whenever this is so, the straight line AC is the upright side of the figure (I. 50).

## Proposition 59 (Problem)

Given two bounded straight lines perpendicular to each other, to find opposite sections whose diameter is one of the given straight lines, and whose vertex is the ends of the straight line, and where the straight lines dropped in each of the sections at a given angle will equal in square the rectangles applied to the other of the straight lines and exceeding by a figure similar to the rectangle contained by the given straight lines.

Let there be the two given bounded straight lines BE and BH, perpendicular to each other, and let the given angle be G; then it is required to describe opposite sections about one of the straight lines BE and BH, so that the ordinates are dropped at an angle G.

And given the two straight lines BE and BH, let an hyperbola be described whose transverse diameter will be the straight line BE, and the upright side of whose figure will be HB, and where the ordinates to BE produced will be at an angle G, and let it be the line ABC; for we have already described how this must be done (I. 55). Then let the straight line EK be drawn through E perpendicular to BE and equal to BH, and let another hyperbola DEF be likewise described whose diameter is BE and the upright side of whose figure is EK, and where the ordinates from the section will be dropped at the same angle G. Then it is evident that B and E are opposite sections, and there is one diameter for them, and their uprights are equal.

## Proposition 60 (Problem)

Given two straight lines bisecting each other, to describe about each of them opposite sections, so that the straight lines are their conjugate diameters and the diameter of one pair of opposite sections is equal in square to the figure of the other pair, and likewise the diameter of the second pair of opposite sections is equal in square to the figure of the first pair.

Let there be the two given straight lines AC and DE bisecting each other; then it is required to describe opposite sections about each of them as a diameter so that the straight lines AC and DE are conjugates in them, and DE is equal in square to the figure about AC, and AC is equal in square to the figure about DE.

Let

rect. AC, CL = sq. DE,

and let LC be perpendicular to CA. And given two straight lines AC and CL perpendicular to each other, let the opposite sections RAG and HCK be described whose transverse diameter will be CA and whose upright side will be CL, and where the ordinates from the sections to CA will be dropped at the given angle (I. 59). Then the straight line DE will be a second diameter of the opposite sections (Sec. Def., I. 11); for it is the mean proportion between the sides of the figure, and, parallel to an ordinate, it has been bisected at B.

Then again let

rect. DE, DF = sq. AC,

and let DF be perpendicular to DE. And given two straight lines ED and DF lying perpendicular to each other, let the opposite sections MDN and OEX be described, whose transverse diameter will be DE and the upright side of whose figure will be DF, and where the ordinates from the sections will be dropped to DE at the given angle (I. 59); then the straight line AC will also be a second diameter of the sections MDN and OEX. And so AC bisects the parallels to DE between the sections RAG and HCK, and DE the parallels to AC; and this it was required to do.

And let such sections be called conjugate.

## BOOK TWO

### Apollonius to Eudemus,

If you are well, well and good, and I too fare pretty well.

I have sent you my son Apollonius bringing you the second book of the *Conics* as arranged by us. Go through it then carefully and acquaint those with it worthy of sharing in such things. And Philonides, the geometer, I introduced to you in Ephesus, if ever he happen about Pergamum, acquaint him with it too. And take care of yourself, to be well. Goodbye.

## Proposition 1

If a straight line touch an hyperbola at its vertex, and from it on both sides of the diameter a straight line is cut off equal to the straight line equal in square to the fourth of the figure, then the straight lines drawn from the center of the section to the ends thus taken on the tangent will not meet the section.

Let there be an hyperbola whose diameter is the straight line AB and center C, and upright side the straight line BF; and let the straight line DE touch the section at B, and let the squares on BD and BE each be equal to the fourth of the figure AB, BF, and the straight lines CD and CE be joined and produced. I say that they will not meet the section.

For if possible, let CD meet the section at G, and from G let the straight line GH be dropped ordinate-wise; therefore it is parallel to DB (I. 17). Since then AB : BF :: sq. AB : rect. AB,BF,

but sq. CB = fourth sq. AB,
and sq. BD = fourth rect. AB,BF.
Therefore AB : BF :: sq. CB : sq. DB :: sq. CH : sq. HG.
And also AB : BF :: rect. AH,HB : sq. HG (I. 21);
therefore sq. CH : sq. HG :: rect. AH,HB : sq. HG.

rect. AH,HB = sq. CH;
and this is absurd (Eucl. II. 6). Therefore the straight line CD will not meet the section. Then likewise we could show that neither does CE; therefore the straight lines CD and CE are asymptotes (*asymptotai*) to the section.

> The word *asymptotos* means literally “not capable of meeting” and is used in a general way in Euclid to refer to any non-secant lines or planes. In Apollonius it is also used in this way, as for instance in II. 14, Porism, where it refers to any straight lines not meeting the hyperbola. The special case where in English the lines are spoken of as asymptotes is the one defined here. Book II, Proposition 14, Porism further declares their peculiar property and significance.

## Proposition 2

With the same things it is to be shown that a straight line cutting the angle contained by the straight lines DC and CE is not another asymptote.

For if possible, let CH be it, and let the straight line BH be drawn through B parallel to CD and let it meet CH at L, and let DG be made equal to BL and let GL be joined and produced to the points K, M. Since then BH and DG are equal and parallel, DB and HG are also equal and parallel. And since AB is bisected at C and a straight line BL is added to it,

rect. AL,LB + sq. CB = sq. CL (Eucl. II. 6).

Likewise then, since GM is parallel to DE, and
DB = BE,

therefore also
GL = LM.
And since
GH = DB,
therefore
GK > DB.
And also
KM > BE,
since also
LM > BE;
therefore
rect. MK,KG > rect. DB,BE
> sq. DB.
Since then
AB : BF :: sq. CB : sq. BD (II. 1),
but
AB : BF :: rect. AL,LB : sq. LK (I. 21),
and
sq. CB : sq. BD :: sq. CL : sq. LG,
therefore also
sq. CL : sq. LG :: rect. AL,LB : sq. LK.
Since then
whole sq. LC : whole sq. LG ::
part subtracted rect. AL,LB : part subtracted sq. LK,
therefore also
sq. LC : sq. LG :: remainder sq. CB : remainder rect. MK,KG,
that is, sq. CB : rect. MK,KG :: sq. CB : sq. DB.

Therefore
sq. DB = rect. MK, KG;
and this is absurd; for it has been shown to be greater than it. Therefore the straight line CH is not an asymptote to the section.

## Proposition 3

If a straight line touches an hyperbola, it will meet both of the asymptotes and it will be bisected at the point of contact, and the square on each of its segments will be equal to the fourth of the figure on the diameter drawn through the point of contact.

Let there be the hyperbola ABC, and its center E, and asymptotes FE and EG, and let some straight line HK touch it at B.

I say that the straight line HK produced will meet the straight lines FE and EG.

For if possible, let it not meet them, and let EB be joined and produced, and let ED be made equal to EB; therefore the straight line BD is a diameter. Then let the squares on HB and BK each be made equal to the fourth of the figure on BD, and let EH and EK be joined. Therefore they are asymptotes (II. 1); and this is absurd (II. 2); for FE and EG are supposed asymptotes. Therefore KH produced will meet the asymptotes EF and EG at F and G.

I say then also that the squares on BF and BG will each be equal to the fourth of the figure on BD.

For let it not be, but if possible, let the squares on BH and BK each be equal to the fourth of the figure. Therefore HE and EK are asymptotes (II. 1); and this is absurd (II. 2). Therefore the squares on FB and BG will each be equal to the fourth of the figure on BD.

## Proposition 4 (Problem)

Given two straight lines containing an angle and a point within the angle, to describe through the point the section of a cone called hyperbola so that the given straight lines are its asymptotes.

Let there be the two straight lines AC and AB containing a chance angle at A, and let some point D be given, and let it be required to describe through D an hyperbola to the asymptotes CA and AB.

Let the straight line AD be joined and produced to E, and let AE be made equal to DA, and let the straight line DF be drawn through D parallel to AB, and let FC be made equal to AF, and let CD be joined and produced to B, and let it be contrived that rect. DE,G = sq. CB, and with AD extended let an hyperbola be described about it through D so that the ordinates equal in square the areas applied to G and exceeding by a figure similar to rectangle DE,G. Since then DF is parallel to BA, and
CF = FA,
therefore
CD = DB;
and so
sq. CB = 4 sq. CD.
And
sq. CB = rect. DE,G;

therefore the squares on CD and DB are each equal to the fourth part of the figure DE, G. Therefore the straight lines AB and AC are asymptotes to the hyperbola described.

## Proposition 5

If the diameter of a parabola or hyperbola bisects some straight line, the tangent to the section at the end of the diameter will be parallel to the bisected straight line.

Let there be the parabola or hyperbola ABC whose diameter is the straight line DBE, and let the straight line FBG touch the section, and let some straight line AEC be drawn in the section making AE equal to EC.

I say that AC is parallel to FG.

For if not, let the straight line CH be drawn through C parallel to FG and let HA be joined. Since then ABC is a parabola or hyperbola whose diameter is DE, and tangent FG, and CH is parallel to it, therefore
CK = KH (I. 46, 47).
But also
CE = EA.
Therefore AH is parallel to KE; and this is absurd; for produced it meets BD (I. 22).

## Proposition 6

If the diameter of an ellipse or circumference of a circle bisects some straight line not through the center, the tangent to the section at the end of the diameter will be parallel to the bisected straight line.

Let there be an ellipse or circumference of a circle whose diameter is the straight line AB, and let AB bisect CD, a straight line not through the center, at the point E.

I say that the tangent to the section at A is parallel to CD.

For let it not be, but if possible, let DF be parallel to the tangent at A; therefore
DG = FG.
But also
DE = EC;
therefore CF is parallel to GE; and this is absurd.

For if G is the center of the section AB, the straight line CF will meet the straight line AB (I. 23); and if it is not, suppose it to be K, and let DK be joined and produced to H, and let CH be joined. Since then
DK = KH,
and also
DE = EC,
therefore CH is parallel to AB. But also CF; and this is absurd. Therefore the tangent at A is parallel to CD.

## Proposition 7

If a straight line touches a section of a cone or circumference of a circle, and a parallel to it is drawn in the section and bisected, the straight line joined from the point of contact to the midpoint will be a diameter of the section.

Let there be a section of a cone or circumference of a circle ABC, and FG tangent to it, and AC parallel to FG and bisected at E, and let BE be joined.

I say that BE is a diameter of the section.

For let it not be, but, if possible, let BH be a diameter of the section. Therefore
AH = HC (First Definition I. 4);
and this is absurd; for
AE = EC.
Therefore BH will not be a diameter of the section. Then likewise we could show that there is no other than BE.

## Proposition 8

If a straight line meets an hyperbola in two points, produced both ways it will meet the asymptotes, and the straight lines cut off on it by the section from the asymptotes will be equal.

Let there be the hyperbola ABC, and the asymptotes ED and DF, and let some straight line AC meet ABC.

I say that produced both ways it will meet the asymptotes.

Let AC be bisected at G and let DG be joined. Therefore it is a diameter of the section (II. 7); therefore the tangent at B is parallel to AC (II. 5, 6). Then let HBK be the tangent (I. 32); then it will meet ED and DF (II. 3). Since then AC is parallel to KH, and KH meets DK and DH, therefore also AC will meet DE and DF.

Let it meet them at E and F; and
HB = BK (II. 3);
therefore also
FG = GE.
And so also
CF = AE.

## Proposition 9

If a straight line meeting the asymptotes is bisected by the hyperbola, it will touch the section in one point only.

For let the straight line CD meeting the asymptotes CA, AD be bisected by the hyperbola at the point E.

I say that it touches the hyperbola at no other point.

For if possible, let it touch it at B. Therefore
CE = BD (II. 8);
and this is absurd; for CE is supposed equal to ED. Therefore it will not touch the section at another point.

## Proposition 10

If some straight line cutting the section meet both of the asymptotes, the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off between the asymptotes and the section is equal to the fourth of the figure on the diameter bisecting the straight lines drawn parallel to the drawn straight line.

Let there be the hyperbola ABC, and let DE, EF be its asymptotes, and let some straight line DF be drawn cutting the section and the asymptotes, and let AC be bisected at G, and let GE be joined, and let EH be made equal to BE, and let BM be drawn from B perpendicular to HEB; therefore BH is a diameter (II. 7), and BM the upright side.

I say that
rect. DA,AF = fourth rect. HB,BM,
then likewise also
rect. DC, CF = fourth rect. HB,BM.

For let KL be drawn through B tangent to the section; therefore it is parallel to DF (II. 6). And since it has been shown
HB : BM :: sq. EB : sq. BK :: sq. EG : sq. GD (II. 1, 3),
and
HB : BM :: rect. HG, GB : sq. GA (I. 21),
therefore
sq. EG : sq. GD :: rect. HG,GB : sq. GA.

Since then
whole sq. EG : whole sq. GD ::
part subtracted rect. HG,GB : part subtracted sq. AG,
therefore also
remainder sq. EB : remainder rect. DA,AF :: sq. EG : sq. GD,
or
remainder sq. EB : remainder rect. DA,AF :: sq. EB : sq. BK.
Therefore
rect. FA,AD = sq. BK.
Then likewise it could be shown also that
rect. DC,CF = sq. BL;
therefore also
rect. FA,AD = rect. DC,CF.

## Proposition 11

If some straight line cut each of the straight lines containing the angle adjacent to the angle containing the hyperbola, it will meet the section in one point only, and the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off between the containing straight lines and the section will be equal to the fourth part of the square on the diameter drawn parallel to the cutting straight line.

Let there be an hyperbola whose asymptotes are CA, AD, and let DA be produced to E, and through some point E let EF be drawn cutting EA and AC.

Now it is evident that it meets the section in one point only; for the straight line drawn through A parallel to EF as AB will cut angle CAD and will meet the section (II. 2) and be its diameter (I. 50); therefore EF will meet the section in one point only (I. 26).

Let it meet it at G.

I say then also that
rect. EG,GF = sq. AB.

For let the straight line HGLK be drawn ordinate-wise through G; therefore the tangent through B is parallel to GH (II. 5). Let it be CD. Since then
CB = BD (II. 3),
therefore
sq. CB or rect. CB,BD : sq. BA :: (CB : BA) comp. (DB : BA).

But
CB : BA :: HG : GF,
and
DB : BA :: GK : GE;
therefore
sq. CB : sq. BA :: (HG : GF) comp. (KG : GE).
But also
rect. KG,GH : rect. EG,GF :: (HG : GF) comp. (KG : GE);
therefore
rect. KG,GH : rect. EG,GF :: sq. CB : sq. BA.
Alternately
rect. FG,GH : sq. CB :: rect. EG,GF : sq. BA.
But it was shown
rect. KG,GH = sq. CB (II. 10);
therefore also
rect. EG,GF = sq. AB.

## Proposition 12

If two straight lines at chance angles are drawn to the asymptotes from some point of those on the section, and parallels are drawn to them from some point of those on the section, then the rectangle contained by the parallels will be equal to that contained by those straight lines to which they were drawn parallel.

Let there be an hyperbola whose asymptotes are AB and BC, and let some point D be taken on the section, and from it let DE and DF be dropped to AB and BC, and let some other point on the section G be taken, and through G let GH and GK be drawn parallel to ED and DF.

I say that
rect. ED, DF = rect. HG,GK.

For let DG be joined and produced to A and C. Since then
rect. AD,DC = rect. AG,GC (II. 8),
therefore
AG : AD :: DC : CG.
But
AG : AD :: GH : ED,
and
DC : CG :: DF : GK;
therefore
GH : DE :: DF : GK.
Therefore
rect. ED,DF = rect. HG,GK.

## Proposition 13

If in the place bounded by the asymptotes and the section some straight line is drawn parallel to one of the asymptotes, it will meet the section in one point only.

Let there be an hyperbola whose asymptotes are CA and AB, and let some point E be taken, and through it let EF be drawn parallel to AB.

I say that it will meet the section.
For if possible, let it not meet it, and let some point G on the section be taken, and through G let GC and GH be drawn parallel to CA and AB, and let
rect. CG,GH = rect. AE,EF,
and let AF be joined and produced; then it will meet the section (I. 2). Let it meet it at K, and through K parallel to CA and AB let KL and KD be drawn; therefore
rect. CG,GH = rect. LK,KD (II. 12).
And it is supposed that also
rect. CG,GH = rect. AE,EF;
therefore
rect. LK,KD or rect. AK,KL = rect. AE,EF;
and this is impossible; for both
KL > EF
and
LA > AE.
Therefore EF will meet the section.

Let it meet it at M.

I say then that it will not meet it at any other point.

For if possible, let it also meet it at N, and through M and N let MX and NB be drawn parallel to CA. Therefore
rect. EM,MX = rect. EN,NB (II. 12);
and this is impossible. Therefore it will not meet the section in another point.

## Proposition 14

The asymptotes and the section, if produced indefinitely, draw nearer to each other and they reach a distance less than any given distance.

Let there be an hyperbola whose asymptotes are AB and AC, and a given distance K.

I say that AB and AC and the section, if produced, draw nearer to each other and will reach a distance less than K.

For let EHF and CGD be drawn parallel to the tangent, and let AH be joined and produced to X. Since then
rect. CG,GD = rect. FH,HE (II. 10),
therefore
DG : FH :: HE : CG.
But
DG > FH (I. 8, 26);
therefore also
HE > CG.

Then likewise we could show that the succeeding straight lines are less.

Then let the distance EL be taken less than K, and through L let LN be drawn parallel to AC; therefore it will meet the section (II. 13). Let it meet it at N, and through N let MNB be drawn parallel to EF. Therefore
MN = EL
and so
MN < K.

### PORISM

Then from this it is evident that the straight lines AB and AC are nearer to the section than any other straight lines, and the angle contained by BA, AC is clearly less than that contained by other asymptotes to the section.

## Proposition 15

The asymptotes of opposite sections are common.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameter is AB and center C.

I say that the asymptotes of the sections A and B are common.

Let the straight lines DAE and FBG be drawn tangent to the sections through the points A and B; they are therefore parallel (I. 44, note). Then let each of the straight lines DA, AE, FB, and BG be cut off equal in square to the fourth of the figure applied to AB; therefore
DA = AE = FB = BG.

Then let CD, CE, CF, and CG be joined. Then it is evident that DC is in a straight line with CG and CE with CF because of the parallels. Since then it is an hyperbola whose diameter is AB and tangent DE, and DA and AE are each equal in square to the fourth of the figure applied to AB, therefore DC and CE are asymptotes (II. 1). For the same reasons then FC and CG are also asymptotes to section B. Therefore the asymptotes of opposite sections are common.

## Proposition 16

If in opposite sections some straight line is drawn cutting each of the straight lines containing the angle adjacent to the angles containing the sections, it will meet each of the opposite sections in one point only, and the straight lines cut off on it by the sections from the asymptotes will be equal.

For let there be the opposite sections A and B whose center is C and asymptotes DCG and ECF, and let some straight line HK be drawn through, cutting each of the straight lines DC and CF.

I say that produced it will meet each of the sections in one point only.

For since DC and CE are asymptotes of section A, and some straight line HK has been drawn across cutting both of the straight lines containing the adjacent angle DCF, therefore HK produced will meet the section (II. 11). Then likewise also B.

Let it meet them at L and M.

Let the straight line ACB be drawn through C parallel to LM; therefore
rect. KL,LH = sq. AC (II. 11)
and
rect. HM,MK = sq. CB (II. 11).
And so also
rect. KL,LH = rect. HM,MK,
and
LH = KM.

## Proposition 17

The asymptotes of conjugate opposite sections are common.

Let there be conjugate opposite sections whose conjugate diameters are AB and CD, and whose center is E.

For let the straight lines FAG, GDH, HBK, and KCF be drawn through the points A, B, C, and D touching the sections; therefore FGHK is a parallelogram (I. 44, note). Then let FEH and KEG be joined; therefore they are straight lines (II. 15) and diagonals of the parallelogram, and they are all bisected at the point E. And since the figure on AB is equal to the square on CD (I. 60), and
CE = ED,
therefore each of the squares on FA, AG, KB, and BH is equal to a fourth of the figure on AB. Therefore the straight lines FEH and KEG are asymptotes of the sections A and B (II. 1). Then likewise we could show that the same straight lines are also asymptotes of the sections C and D. Therefore the asymptotes of conjugate opposite sections are common.

## Proposition 18

If a straight line meeting one of the conjugate opposite sections, when produced both ways, falls outside the section, it will meet both of the adjacent sections in one point only.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C, and D, and let some straight line EF meet the section C and produced both ways fall outside the section.

I say that it will meet both of the sections A and B in one point only.

For let GH and KL be asymptotes of the sections. Therefore EF meets both GH and KL (II. 3). Then it is evident that it will also meet the sections A and B in one point only (II. 16).

## Proposition 19

If some straight line is drawn touching some one of the conjugate opposite sections at random, it will meet the adjacent sections and will be bisected at the point of contact.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C, and D, and let some straight line ECF touch it at C.

I say that produced it will meet sections A and B and will be bisected at C.
It is evident now that it will meet sections A and B (II. 18); let it meet them at G and H.

I say that
CG = CH.

For let the asymptotes of the sections KL and MN be drawn. Therefore
EG = FH (II. 16),
and
CE = CF (II. 3),
and
CG = CH.

## Proposition 20

If a straight line touches one of the conjugate opposite sections, and two straight lines are drawn through their center, one through the point of contact, and one parallel to the tangent until it meet one of the adjacent sections, then the straight line touching the section at the point of meeting will be parallel to the straight line drawn through the point of contact and the center, and those through the points of contact and the center will be conjugate diameters of the opposite sections.

Let there be conjugate opposite sections whose conjugate diameters are the straight lines AB and CD, and center Y, and let EF be drawn touching the section A, and produced let it meet CY at T, and let EY be joined and produced to X, and through Y let YG be drawn parallel to EF, and through G let HG be drawn touching the section.

I say that HG is parallel to YE, and GO and EX are conjugate diameters.
For let the straight lines KE, GL, and CRP be drawn ordinate-wise, and let AM and CN be the parameters. Since then
BA : AM :: NC : CD (I. 60),
but
BA : AM :: rect. YK, KF : sq. KE (I. 37),
and
NC : CD :: sq. GL : rect. YL,LH (I. 37),
therefore also
rect. YK,KF : sq. EK :: sq. GL : rect. YL,LH.

But
rect. YK,KF : sq. EK :: (YK : KE) comp. (FK : KE),
and
sq. GL : rect. YL,LH :: (GL : LY) comp. (GL : LH);
therefore
ratio (YK : KE) comp. (FK : KE) = ratio (GL : LY) comp. (GL : LH);
and of these
FK : KE :: GL : LY;
for each of the straight lines EK, KF, and FE is parallel to each of the straight lines YL, LG, and GY respectively. Therefore as remainder
YK : KE :: GL : LH.

Also the sides about the equal angles at K and L are proportional; therefore triangle EKY is similar to triangle GHL and will have equal the angles the corresponding sides subtend. Therefore
angle EYK = angle LGH.
But also
angle KYG = angle LGY;
and therefore
angle EYG = angle HGY.
Therefore EY is parallel to GH.

Then let it be contrived that
PG : GR :: HG : *S*;
therefore *S* is a half of the parameter of the ordinates to the diameter GO in sections C and D (I. 51). And since CD is the second diameter of the sections A and B, and ET meets it, therefore
rect. TY,EK = sq. CY;
for if we draw from E a parallel to KY, the rectangle contained by TY and the straight line cut off by the parallel will be equal to the square on CY (I. 38). And therefore
TY : EK :: sq. TY : sq. YC (Eucl. VI. 20).

But
TY : EK :: TF : FE
or
TY : EK :: trgl. TYF : trgl. EFY (Eucl. VI. 1),
and
sq. TY : sq. CY :: trgl. YTF : trgl. YCP (Eucl. VI. 19)
or
sq. TY : sq. CY :: trgl. TYF : trgl. GHY (II. 1).
Therefore
trgl. TYF : trgl. EFY :: trgl. TYF : trgl. YGH.
Therefore
trgl. GHY = trgl. EFY.
But they also have
angle HGY = angle YEF;
for EY is parallel to GH, and EF to GY. Therefore the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional (Eucl. VI. 15). Therefore
GH : EY :: EF : GY;
therefore
rect. HG,GY = rect. FE,EY.

And since
*S* : HG :: RG : GP;
and
RG : GP :: YE : EF;
for they are parallel; therefore also
*S* : HG :: YE : EF.

But, with FG taken as common height,
*S* : HG :: rect. *S*,GY : rect. HG,GY,
and
YE : EF :: sq. YE : rect. YE,EF.

And therefore
rect. *S*,GY : rect. HG,GY :: sq. YE : rect. FE,EY.
Alternately
rect. *S*,GY : sq. EY :: rect. HG,GY : rect. FE,EY.

But
rect. HG,GY = rect. FE,EY (above),
therefore also
rect. *S*,GY = sq. EY.

And rectangle *S*,GY is a fourth of the figure on GO; for
GY = half GO,
and *S* is the parameter; and
sq. EY = fourth sq. EX;
for
EY = YX.
Therefore the square on EY is equal to the figure on GO. Then likewise we could show also that GO is equal in square to the figure on EX. Therefore EX and GO are conjugate diameters of the opposite sections A, B, C, and D.

## Proposition 21

The same things being supposed it is to be shown that the point of meeting of the tangents is on one of the asymptotes.

Let there be conjugate opposite sections, whose diameters are the straight lines AB and CD, and let the straight lines AE and EC be drawn tangent.

I say that the point E is on the asymptote.

For since the square on CY is equal to the fourth of the figure on AB (I. 60), and
sq. AE = sq. CY (II. 17),
therefore also the square on AE is equal to the fourth part of the figure on AB. Let EY be joined; therefore EY is an asymptote (II. 1); therefore the point E is on the asymptote.

## Proposition 22

If in conjugate opposite sections a radius is drawn to any one of the sections, and a parallel is drawn to it meeting one of the adjacent sections and meeting the asymptotes, then the rectangle contained by the segments produced between the section and the asymptotes on the straight line drawn is equal to the square on the radius.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C and D, and let there be the asymptotes of the sections YEF and YGH, and from the center Y let some straight line YCD be drawn across, and let HE be drawn parallel to it cutting both the adjacent section and the asymptotes.

I say that
rect. EK,KH = sq. CY.

Let KL be bisected at M, and let MY be joined and produced; therefore AB is the diameter of the sections A and B (I. 51, end). And since the tangent at A is parallel to EH (II. 5), therefore EH has been dropped ordinate-wise to AB (I. 17). And the center is Y; therefore AB and CD are conjugate diameters (First Definition I. 6). Therefore the square on CY is equal to the fourth of the figure on AB (I. 60). And the rectangle HK, KE is equal to the fourth part of the figure on AB (II. 10); therefore also
rect. HK,KE = sq. CY.

## Proposition 23

If in conjugate opposite sections some radius is drawn to any one of the sections, and a parallel is drawn to it meeting the three adjacent sections, then the rectangle contained by the segments produced between the three sections on the straight line drawn is twice the square on the radius.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C, and D, and let the center of the sections be F, and from the point F let some straight line CY be drawn to meet any one of the sections, and let KL be drawn parallel to CY cutting the three adjacent sections.

I say that
rect. KM, ML = 2 sq. CY.

Let the asymptotes to the sections, EF and GH, be drawn; therefore
sq. CY = rect. HM,ME (II. 22) = rect. HK,KE (II. 11).

And
rect. HM,ME + rect. HK,KE = rect. LM,MK
because of the straight lines on the ends being equal (II. 8, 16). Therefore also
rect. LM,MK = 2 sq. CY.

## Proposition 24

If two straight lines meet a parabola each at two points, and if a point of meeting of neither one of them is contained by the points of meeting of the other, then the straight lines will meet each other outside the section.

Let there be the parabola ABCD, and let

the two straight lines AB and CD meet, and let a point of meeting of neither of them be contained by the points of meeting of the other.

I say that the straight lines produced will meet each other.

Let the diameters of the section, EBF and GCH, be drawn through the points B and C; therefore they are parallel (I. 51, end) and each one cuts the section in one point only (I. 26). Then let BC be joined; therefore

angle EBC + angle BCG = 2 rt. angles,

and DC and BA produced make angles less than two right angles. Therefore they will meet each other outside the section (I. 10; Eucl. Post. 5).

## Proposition 25

If two straight lines meet an hyperbola each at two points, and if a point of meeting of neither of them is contained by the points of meeting of the other, then the straight lines will meet each other outside the section, but within the angle containing the section.

Let there be an hyperbola, whose asymptotes are AB and AC, and let the two straight lines EF and GH cut the section, and let a point of meeting of neither of them be contained by the points of meeting of the other.

I say that the straight lines EF and GH produced will meet outside the section, but within the angle CAB.

For let the straight lines AF and AH be joined and produced, and let FH be joined. And since the straight lines EF and GH produced cut the angles AFH and AHF, and the said angles are less than two right angles (Eucl. I. 17), the straight lines EF and GH produced will meet each other outside the section, but within the angle BAC.

Then we could likewise show it, even if the straight lines EF and GH are tangents to the sections.

## Proposition 26

If in an ellipse or circumference of a circle two straight lines not through the center cut each other, then they do not bisect each other.

For if possible, in the ellipse or circumference of a circle let the two straight lines CD and EF not through the center bisect each other at G, and let the point H be the center of the section, and let GH be joined and produced to A and B.

Since then the straight line AB is a diameter bisecting EF, therefore the tangent at A is parallel to EF (II. 6). We could then likewise show that it is also parallel to CD. And so also EF is parallel to CD. And this is impossible. Therefore CD and EF do not bisect each other.

## Proposition 27

If two straight lines touch an ellipse or circumference of a circle, and if the straight line joining the points of contact is through the center of the section, the tangents will be parallel; but if not, they will meet on the same side of the center.

Let there be the ellipse or circumference of a circle AB, and let the straight lines CAD and EBF touch it, and AB be joined, and first let it be through the center.

I say that CD is parallel to EF.

For since AB is a diameter of the section, and CD touches it at A, therefore CD is parallel to the ordinates to AB (I. 17). Then for the same reasons BF is also parallel to the same ordinates. Therefore CD is also parallel to EF.

Then let AB not be through the center, as in the second drawing, and let the diameter AH be drawn, and let KHL be drawn tangent through H; therefore KL is parallel to CD. Therefore EF produced will meet CD on the same side of the center as AD.

## Proposition 28

If in a section of a cone or circumference of a circle some straight line bisects two parallel straight lines, then it will be a diameter of the section.

For let AB and CD, two parallel straight lines in a conic section, be bisected at E and F, and let EF be joined and produced.

I say that it is a diameter of the section.

For if not, let the straight line GFH be so if possible. Therefore the tangent at G is parallel to AB (II. 5, 6). And so the same straight line is parallel to CD. And GH is a diameter; therefore

CH = HD (First Def. I. 4)
and this is impossible; for it is supposed
CE = ED

Therefore GH is not a diameter. Then likewise we could show that there is no other except EF. Therefore EF will be a diameter of the section.

## Proposition 29

If in a section of a cone or circumference of a circle two tangents meet, the straight line drawn from their point of meeting to the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact is a diameter of the section.

Let there be a section of a cone or circumference of a circle to which let the straight lines AB and AC, meeting at A, be drawn tangent, and let BC be joined and bisected at D, and let AD be joined.

I say that it is a diameter of the section.

For if possible, let DE be a diameter, and let EC be joined; then it will cut the section (I. 35, 36). Let it cut it at F, and through F let FKG be drawn parallel to CDB. Since then

CD = DB

also

FH = HG

And since the tangent at L is parallel to BC (II. 5, 6), and FG is also parallel to BC, therefore also FG is parallel to the tangent at L. Therefore

FH = HK (I. 46, 47);

and this is impossible. Therefore DE is not a diameter. Then likewise we could show that there is no other except AD.

## Proposition 30

If two straight lines tangent to a section of a cone or to a circumference of a circle meet, the diameter drawn from the point of meeting will bisect the straight line joining the points of contact.

Let there be the section of a cone or circumference of a circle BC, and let two tangents BA and AC be drawn to it meeting at A, and let BC be joined and let AD be drawn through A as a diameter of the section.

I say that

DB = DC

For let it not be, but if possible, let
BE = EC,

and let AE be joined; therefore AE is a diameter of the section (II. 29). But AD is also a diameter; and this is absurd. For if the section is an ellipse, the point A at which the diameters meet each other, will be a center outside the section; and this is impossible; and if the section is a parabola, the diameters meet each other (I. 51, end); and if it is an hyperbola, and the straight lines BA and AC meet the section without containing one another’s points of meeting, then the center is within the angle containing the hyperbola (II. 25); but it is also on it, for it has been supposed a center since DA and AE are diameters (I. 51, end); and this is absurd. Therefore BE is not equal to EC.

## Proposition 31

If two straight lines touch each of the opposite sections, then if the straight line joining the points of contact falls through the center, the tangents will be parallel, but if not, they will meet on the same side as the center.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let the straight lines CAD and EBF be tangent to them at A and B, and let the straight line joined from A to B fall first through the center of the sections.

I say that CD is parallel to EF.

For since they are opposite sections of which AB is a diameter, and CD touches one of them at A, therefore the straight line drawn through B parallel to CD touches the other section (I. 48). But EF also touches it at B. Therefore EF is parallel to CD.

Then let the straight line from A to B not be through the center of the sections, and let AG be drawn as a diameter of the sections, and let HK be drawn tangent through H; therefore HK is parallel to CD, and since the straight lines EF and HK touch an hyperbola, therefore they will meet (II. 25, end). And HK is parallel to CD; therefore also the straight lines CD and EF produced will meet. And it is evident they are on the same side as the center.

## Proposition 32

If straight lines meet each of the opposite sections, in one point when touching or in two points when cutting, and, when produced, the straight lines meet, then their point of meeting will be in the angle adjacent to the angle containing the section.

Let there be opposite sections and the straight lines AB and CD either touching the opposite sections in one point or cutting them in two points, and let them meet when produced.

I say that their point of meeting will be in the angle adjacent to the angle containing the section.

Let FG and HK be asymptotes to the sections; therefore AB produced will meet the asymptotes (II. 8). Let it meet them at H and G. And since AB and CD are supposed as meeting, it is evident that either they will meet in the place under angle FHL or in that under angle GLK. And likewise also, if they touch (II. 3).

## Proposition 33

If a straight line meeting one of the opposite sections, when produced both ways, falls outside the section, it will not meet the other section, but will fall through the three places of which one is that contained by the angle containing the section, and two are those contained by the angle adjacent to the angle containing the section.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let some straight line CD cut A, and, when produced both ways, let it fall outside the section.

I say that the straight line CD does not meet the section B.

For let EF and GH be drawn as asymptotes to the sections; therefore CD produced will meet the asymptotes (II. 8). And it only meets them in the points E and H. And so it will not meet the section B.

And it is evident that it will fall through the three places. For if some straight line meets both of the opposite sections, it will meet neither of the opposite sections in two points. For if it meets it in two points, by what has just been proved it will not meet the other section.

## Proposition 34

If some straight line touch one of the opposite sections and a parallel to it be drawn in the other section, then the straight line drawn from the point of contact to the midpoint of the parallel will be a diameter of the opposite sections.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let some straight line CD touch one of them A, at A, and let EF be drawn parallel to CD in the other section, and let it be bisected at G, and let AG be joined.

I say that AG is a diameter of the opposite sections.

For if possible, let AHK be. Therefore the tangent at H is parallel to CD (II. 31). But CD is also parallel to EF; and therefore the tangent at H is parallel to EF. Therefore

EG = GF

and this is impossible; for

EG = GF

Therefore AH is not a diameter of the opposite sections.

Therefore AB is.

## Proposition 35

If a diameter in one of the opposite sections bisects some straight line, the straight line touching the other section at the end of the diameter will be parallel to the bisected straight line.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let their diameter AB bisect the straight line CD in section B at E.

I say that the tangent to the section at A is parallel to CD.

For if possible, let DF be parallel to the tangent to the section at A; therefore

DG = GF (I. 48).

But also

DE = EC.

Therefore CF is parallel to EG; and this is impossible; for produced it meets it (I. 22). Therefore DF is not parallel to the tangent to the section at A nor is any other straight line except CD.

## Proposition 36

If parallel straight lines are drawn, one in each of the opposite sections, then the straight line joining their midpoints will be a diameter of the opposite sections.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let the straight lines CD and EF be drawn, one in each of them, and let them be parallel, and let them both be bisected at points G and H, and let GH be joined.

I say that GH is a diameter of the opposite sections.

For if not, let GK be one. Therefore the tangent to A is parallel to CD (II. 5); and so also to EF. Therefore

EK = KF (I. 48);
and this is impossible, since also

EH = HF

Therefore GK is not a diameter of the opposite sections. Therefore GH is.

## Proposition 37

If a straight line not through the center cuts the opposite sections, then the straight line joined from its midpoint to the center is a so-called upright diameter of the opposite sections, and the straight line drawn from the center parallel to the bisected straight line is a transverse diameter conjugate to it.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let some straight line CD not through the center cut the sections A and B and let it be bisected at E, and let Y be the center of the sections, and let YE be joined, and through Y let AB be drawn parallel to CD.

I say that the straight lines AB and EY are conjugate diameters of the sections.

For let DY be joined and produced to F, and let CF be joined. Therefore

DY = YF (I. 30).

But also

DE = EC;

therefore EY is parallel to FC. Let BA be produced to G. And since

DY = YF,

therefore also

EY = FG;

and so also

CG = FG.

Therefore the tangent at A is parallel to CF (II. 5); and so also to EY. Therefore EY and AB are conjugate diameters (I. 16).

## Proposition 38

If two straight lines meeting touch opposite sections, the straight line joined from the point of meeting to the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact will be a so-called upright diameter of the opposite sections, and the straight line drawn through the center parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact is a transverse diameter conjugate to it.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and CY and YD touching the sections, and let CD be joined and bisected at E, and let EY be joined.

I say that the diameter EY is a so-called upright, and the straight line drawn through the center parallel to CD is a transverse diameter conjugate to it.

For if possible, let EF be a diameter, and let F be a point taken at random; therefore DY will meet EF. Let it meet it at F, and let CF be joined; therefore

CF will hit the section (I. 32). Let it hit it at A, and through A let AB be drawn parallel to CD. Since then EF is a diameter, and bisects CD, it also bisects the parallels to it (First Def. I. 4). Therefore

AG = GB.

And since

CE = ED,

and is on triangle CFD, therefore also

AG = GK.

And so also

GK = GB;

and this is impossible. Therefore EF will not be a diameter.

## Proposition 39

If two straight lines meeting touch opposite sections, the straight line drawn through the center and the point of meeting of the tangents bisects the straight line joining the points of contact.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let two straight lines CE and ED be drawn touching A and B, and let CD be joined, and let EF be drawn as a diameter.

I say that

CF = FD.

For if not, let CD be bisected at G, and let GE be joined; therefore GE is a diameter (II. 38). But EF is also; therefore E is the center (I. 31, end). Therefore the point of meeting of the tangents is at the center of the sections; and this is absurd (II. 32). Therefore CF is not unequal to FD. Therefore equal.

## Proposition 40

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and through the point of meeting a straight line is drawn, parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and meeting the sections, then the straight lines drawn from the points of meeting to the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact touch the sections.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let two straight lines CE and ED be drawn touching A and B, and let CD be joined, and through E let FEG be drawn parallel to CD, and let CD be bisected at H, and let FH and HG be joined.

I say that FH and HG touch the sections.

Let EH be joined; therefore EH is an upright diameter, and the straight line drawn through the center parallel to CD a transverse diameter conjugate to it (II. 38). And let the center Y be taken, and let AYB be drawn parallel to CD; therefore HE and AB are conjugate diameters. And CH has been drawn ordinatewise to the second diameter, and CE has been drawn touching the section and meeting the second diameter. Therefore the rectangle EY, YH is equal to the square on the half of the second diameter (I. 38), that is to the fourth part of the figure on AB (Second Def. I. 10). And since FE has been drawn ordinatewise and FH joined, therefore FH touches the section A (I. 38). Likewise then also GH touches section B. Therefore FH and HG touch sections A and B.

## Proposition 41

If in opposite sections two straight lines not through the center cut each other, then they do not bisect each other.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and in A and B let the two straight lines CB and AD not through the center cut each other at E.

I say that they do not bisect each other.

For if possible, let them bisect each other, and let Y be the center of the sections, and let EY be joined; therefore EY is a diameter (II. 37). Let YF be drawn through Y parallel to BC; therefore YF is a diameter and conjugate to EY (II. 37). Therefore the tangent at F is parallel to EY (First Def. I. 6). Then for the same reasons, with HK drawn parallel to AD, the tangent at H is parallel to EY; and so also the tangent at F is parallel to the tangent at H; and this is absurd; for it has been shown it also meets it (II. 31). Therefore the straight lines CB and AD not being through the center do not bisect each other.

## Proposition 42

If in conjugate opposite sections two straight lines not through the center cut each other, they do not bisect each other.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C and D, and in A, B, C and D let the two straight lines not through the center, EF and GH, cut each other at K.

I say that they do not bisect each other.

For if possible, let them bisect each other, and let the center of the sections be Y, and let AB be drawn parallel to EF and CD to HG; and let KY be joined; therefore KY and AB are conjugate diameters (II. 37). Likewise YK and CD are also conjugate diameters. And so also the tangent at A is parallel to the tangent at C; and this is impossible; for it meets it, since the tangent at C cuts the sections A and B (II. 19), and the tangent at A sections C and D; it is evident also that their point of meeting is in the place under angle AYC (II. 21). Therefore the straight lines EF and GH not being through the center do not bisect each other.

## Proposition 43

If a straight line cuts one of the conjugate opposite sections in two points, and through the center one straight line is drawn to the midpoint of the cutting straight line and another straight line is drawn parallel to the cutting straight line, they will be conjugate diameters of the opposite sections.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C and D, and let some straight line cut section A at the two points E and F, and let FE be bisected at G, and let Y be center, and let YG be joined, and let CY be drawn parallel to EF.

I say that AY and YC are conjugate diameters.

For since AY is a diameter, and bisects EF, the tangent at A is parallel to EF (II. 5); and so also to CY. Since then they are opposite sections, and a tangent has been drawn to one of them, A, at A, and from the center Y one straight line YA is joined to the point of contact, and another CY has been drawn parallel to the tangent, therefore YA and CY are conjugate diameters; for this has been shown before (II. 20).

## Proposition 44 (Problem)

Given a section of a cone, to find a diameter.

Let there be the given conic section on which are the points A, B, C, D and E. Then it is required to find a diameter.

Let it have been done, and let it be CH. Then with DF and EH drawn ordinatewise and produced

DF = FB,

and

EH = HA (First Def. I. 4).

If then we fix the straight lines BD and EA in position to be parallel, the points H and F will be given. And so HFC will be given in position.

Then it will be constructed (*syntethesetai*) thus: let there be the given conic section on which are the points A, B, C, D and E, and let the straight lines BD and AE be drawn parallel, and be bisected at F and H. And the straight line FH joined will be a diameter of the section (First Def. I. 4). And in the same way we could also find an indefinite number of diameters.

## Proposition 45 (Problem)

Given an ellipse or hyperbola, to find the center.

And this is evident; for if two diameters of the section, AB and CD, are drawn through (II. 44), the point at which they cut each other will be the center of the section, as indicated below.

## Proposition 46 (Problem)

Given a section of a cone, to find the axis.

Let the given section of a cone first be a parabola, on which are the points F, C and E. Then it is required to find its axis.

For let AB be drawn as a diameter of it (II. 44). If then AB is an axis, what was enjoined would have been done; but if not, let it have been done, and let CD be the axis; therefore the axis CD is parallel to AB (I. 51, end) and bisects the straight lines drawn perpendicular to it (First Def. I. 7). And the perpendiculars to CD are also perpendiculars to AB; and so CD bisects the perpendiculars to AB. If then I fix EF, the perpendicular to AB, it will be given in position, and therefore

ED = DF;

therefore the point D is given. Therefore through the given point D, CD has been drawn parallel in position to AB; therefore CD is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let there be the given parabola on which are the points F, E and A, and let AB, a diameter of it, be drawn (II. 44), and let BE be drawn perpendicular to it and let it be produced to F. If then

EB = BF,

it is evident that AB is the axis (First Def. I. 7); but if not, let EF be bisected by D, and let CD be drawn parallel to AB. Then it is evident that CD is the axis of the section; for being parallel to a diameter, that is being a diameter (I. 51, end), it bisects EF at right angles. Therefore CD has been found as the axis of the given parabola (First Def. I. 7).

And it is evident that the parabola has only one axis. For if there is another, as AB, it will be parallel to CD (I. 51, end). And it cuts EF, and so it also bisects it (First Def. I. 4).

Therefore

BE = BF;

and this is absurd.

## Proposition 47 (Problem)

Given an hyperbola or ellipse, to find the axis.

Let there be the hyperbola or ellipse ABC; then it is required to find its axis.

Let it have been found and let it be KD, and K the center of the section; therefore KD bisects the ordinates to itself and at right angles (First Def. I. 7).

Let the perpendicular CDA be drawn, and let KA and KC be joined. Since then

CD = DA,

therefore

CK = KA.

If then we fix the given point C, CK will be given. And so the circle described with center K and radius KC will also pass through A and will be given in position. And the section ABC is also given in position; therefore the point A is given. But the point C is also given; therefore CA is given in position. Also

CD = DA,

therefore the point D is given. But also K is given; therefore DK is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let there be the given hyperbola or ellipse ABC, and let K be taken as its center; and let a point C be taken at random on the section, and let the circle CEA, with center K and radius KC, be described, and let CA be joined and bisected at D, and let KC, KD, and KA be joined, and let KD be drawn through to B.

Since then

AD = DC

and DK is common, therefore the two straight lines CD and DK are equal to the two straight lines AD and DK; and

base KA = base KC.

Therefore KBD bisects ADC at right angles. Therefore KD is an axis (First Def. I. 7).

Let MKN be drawn through K parallel to CA; therefore MN is the axis of the section conjugate to BK (First Def. I. 8).

## Proposition 48 (Problem)

Then with these things shown, let it be next in order to show that there are no other axes of the same sections.

For if possible, let there also be another axis KG. Then in the same way as before, with AH drawn perpendicular,

AH = HL (First Def. I. 4);

and so also

AK = KL.

But also

AK = KC;

therefore

KL = KC;

and this is absurd.

Now that the circle AEC does not hit the section also in another point between the points A, B and C, is evident in the case of the hyperbola; and in the case of the ellipse let the perpendiculars CR and LS be drawn. Since then

KC = KL;

for they are radii; also

sq. KC = sq. KL.

But

sq. CR + sq. RK = sq. CK,

and

sq. LS + sq. SK = sq. LK;

therefore

sq. CR + sq. RK = sq. LS + sq. SK.

Therefore

difference between sq. CR and sq. SL = difference between sq. SK and sq. RK.

Again since

rect. MR, RN + sq. RK = sq. KR,

and also

rect. MS, SN + sq. SK = sq. KS (Eucl. II. 5),

therefore

rect. MR, RN + sq. RK = rect. MS, SN + sq. SK.

Therefore

difference between sq. KR and sq. KS = difference between rect. MR, RN and rect. MS, SN.

And it was shown that

difference between sq. SK and sq. KR = difference between sq. CR and sq. SL;

therefore

difference between sq. CR and sq. SL = difference between rect. MR, RN and rect. MS, SN.

And since CR and LS are ordinates

sq. CR : rect. MR, RN :: sq. SL : rect. MS, SN (I. 21).

But the same difference was also shown for both; therefore

sq. CR = rect. MR, RN,

and

sq. SL = rect. MS, SN (Eucl. V. 16, 17, 9).

Therefore the line LCM is a circle; and this is absurd; for it is supposed an ellipse.

## Proposition 49 (Problem)

Given a section of a cone and a point not within the section, to draw from the point a straight line touching the section in one point.

Let the given section of a cone first be a parabola whose axis is BD. Then it is required to draw a straight line as prescribed from the given point which is not within the section.

Then the given point is either on the line or on the axis or somewhere else outside.

Now let it be on the line, and let it be A, and let it have been done, and let it be AE, and let AD be drawn perpendicular; then it will be given in position. And

BE = BD (I. 35);

and BD is given; therefore BE is also given. And the point B is given; therefore E is also given. But A also; therefore AE is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let AD be drawn perpendicular from A, and let BE be made equal to BD, and let AE be joined.

Then it is evident that it touches the section (i. 33).

Again let the given point E be on the axis, and let it have been done, and let AE be drawn tangent, and let AD be drawn perpendicular; therefore

BE = BD (i. 35).

And BE is given; therefore also BD is given. And the point B is given; therefore D is also given. And DA is perpendicular; therefore DA is given in position. Therefore the point A is given. But also E; therefore AE is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let BD be made equal to BE, and from D let DA be drawn perpendicular to ED, and let AE be joined. Then it is evident that AE touches (i. 33).

And it is evident also that, even if the given point is the same as B, the straight line drawn from B perpendicular touches the section (i. 17).

Then let C be the given point, and let it have been done, and let CA be it, and through C let CF be drawn parallel to the axis, that is to BD; therefore CF is given in position. And from A let AF be drawn ordinatewise to CF; then

CG = FG (i. 35).

And the point G is given; therefore F is also given. And FA has been erected ordinatewise, that is, parallel to the tangent at G (i. 32); therefore FA is given in position. Therefore A is also given; but also C. Therefore CA is given in position.

It will be constructed thus: let CF be drawn through C parallel to BD, and let FG be made equal to CG, and let FA be drawn parallel to the tangent at G (above), and let AC be joined. It is evident then that this will do the problem (i. 33).

Again let it be a hyperbola whose axis is DBC and center H, and asymptotes HE and HF. Then the given point will be given either on the section or on the axis or within angle EHF or in the adjacent place or on one of the asymptotes containing the section or in the place between the straight lines containing the angle vertical to angle EHF.

Let the point A first be on the section, and let it have been done, and let AG be tangent, and let AD be drawn perpendicular, and let BC be the transverse side of the figure; then

CD : DB : : CG : GB (i. 36).

And the ratio of CD to DB is given; for both the straight lines are given; therefore also the ratio of CG to GB is given. And BC is given; therefore point G is given. But also A; therefore AG is given in position.

It will be constructed thus: let AD be drawn perpendicular from A, and let

CG : GB : : CD : DB;

and let AG be joined. Then it is evident that AG touches the section (i. 34).

Then again let the given point G be on the axis, and let it have been done, and let AG be drawn tangent, and let AD be drawn perpendicular. Then for the same reasons

CG : GB : : CD : DB (i. 36).

And BC is given; therefore the point D is given. And DA is perpendicular; therefore DA is given in position. And also the section is given in position; therefore the point A is given. But also G; therefore AG is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let the other things be supposed the same, and let it be contrived that

CG : GB : : CD : DB,

and let DA be drawn perpendicular, and let AG be joined. Then it is evident that AG does the problem (i. 34), and that from G another tangent to the section could be drawn on the other side.

With the same things supposed let the given point K be in the place inside angle EHF, and let it be required to draw a tangent to the section from K. Let it have been done, and it be KA, and let KH be joined and produced, and let HN be made equal to HL, therefore they are all given. Then also LN will be given. Then let AM be drawn ordinatewise to MN; then also

NK : KL : : MN : ML

And the ratio of NK to KL is given; therefore also the ratio of NM to ML is given. And the point L is given, therefore also M is given. And MA has been erected parallel to the tangent at L; therefore MA is given in position. And also the section ALB is given in position; therefore the point A is given. But K is also given; therefore AK is given.

Then it will be constructed thus: let the other things be supposed the same, and the given point K, and KH be joined and produced, and let HN be made equal to HL, and let it be contrived that

NK : KL : : NM : ML

and let MA be drawn parallel to the tangent at L (above), and let KA be joined; therefore KA touches the section (i. 34).

And it is evident that a tangent to the section could also be drawn to the other side.

With the same things supposed let the given point F be on one of the asymptotes containing the section, and let it be required to draw from F a tangent to the section. And let it have been done, and let it be FAE, and through A let AD be drawn parallel to EH; then

DH = DF,

since also

FA = AE (ii. 3).

And FH is given; therefore also point D is given. And through the given point D, DA has been drawn parallel in position to EH; therefore DA is given in position. And the section is also given in position; therefore the point A is given. But F is also given; therefore the straight line FAE is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let there be the section AB, and asymptotes EH and HF, and the given point F on one of the asymptotes containing the section, and let FH be bisected at D, and through D let DA be drawn parallel to HE, and let FA be joined. And since

FD = DH,

therefore also

FA = AE.

And so by things shown before, the straight line FAE touches the section (ii. 9).

With the same things supposed, let the given point be in the place under the angle adjacent to the straight lines containing the section, and let it be K; it is required then to draw a tangent to the section from K. And let it have been done, and let it be KA, and let KH be joined and produced; then it will be given in position. If then a given point C is taken on the section, and through C, CD is drawn parallel to KH, it will be given in position. And if CD is bisected at E, and HE is joined and produced, it will be, in position, a diameter conjugate to KH (First Def. i. 6). Then let HG be made equal to BH, and through A let AL be drawn parallel to BH; then because KH and BG are conjugate diameters, and AK a tangent, and AL a straight line drawn parallel to BG, therefore rectangle KH, HL is equal to the fourth part of the figure on BG (i. 38). Therefore rectangle KH, HL is given. And KH is given; therefore HL is also given. But it is also given in position; and the point H is given; therefore L is also given. And through L, LA has been drawn parallel in position to BG; therefore LA is given in position. And the section is also given in position; therefore the point A is given. But also K; therefore AK is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let the other things be supposed the same, and let the given point K be in the aforesaid place, and let KH be joined and produced, and let some point C be taken, and let CD be drawn parallel to KH, and let CD be bisected by E and let EH be joined and produced, and let HG be made equal to BH; therefore GB is a transverse diameter conjugate to KH (First Def. i. 6). Then let rectangle KH, HL be made equal to the fourth of the figure on BG, and through L let LA be drawn parallel to BG, and let KA be joined; then it is clear that KA touches the section by the converse of the theorem (i. 38).

And if it is given in the place between the straight lines FH and HP, the problem is impossible. For the tangent will cut GH. And so it will meet both FH and HP; and this is impossible by the things shown in the thirty-first theorem of the first book (i. 31) and in the third of this book (ii. 3).

With the same things supposed let the section be an ellipse, and the given point A on the section, and let it be required to draw from A a tangent to the section. Let it have been done, and let it be AG, and let AD be drawn from A ordinatewise to the axis BC; then the point D will be given, and

CD : DB : : CG : GB (i. 36).

And the ratio of CD to DB is given; therefore the ratio of CG to GB is also given. Therefore the point G is given. But also A; therefore AG is given in position.

Then it will be constructed thus: let AD be drawn perpendicular, and let

CG : GB : : CD : DB,

and let AG be joined. Then it is evident that AG touches, as also in the case of the hyperbola (i. 34).

Then again let the given point be K, and let it be required to draw a tangent. Let it have been done, and let it be KA, and let the straight line KH be joined to the center H and produced to N; then it will be given in position. And if AM is drawn ordinatewise, then

NK : KL : : NM : ML (i. 36).

And the ratio of NK : KL is given; therefore the ratio of MN to LM is also given. Therefore the point M is given. And MA has been erected ordinatewise; for it is parallel to the tangent at L; therefore MA is given in position. Therefore the point A is given. But also K; therefore KA is given in position.

And the construction is the same as for the preceding.

## Proposition 50 (*Problem*)

Given the section of a cone, to draw a tangent which will make with the axis, on the same side as the section, an angle equal to a given acute angle.

Let the section of a cone first be a parabola whose axis is AB; then it is required to draw a tangent to the section which will make with the axis AB, on the same side as the section, an angle equal to the given acute angle.

Let it have been done, and let it be CD; therefore angle BDC is given. Let BC be drawn perpendicular; then the angle at B is also given. Therefore the ratio of DB to BC is given. But the ratio of BD to BA is given; therefore also the ratio of AB to BC is given. And the angle at B is given; therefore angle BAC is also given. And it is in position with respect to BA and the given point A; therefore CA is given in position. And the section is also given in position; therefore the point C is given. And CD touches; therefore CD is given in position.

Then the problem will be constructed thus: let the given section of a cone first be a parabola whose axis is AB, and the given acute angle, angle EFG, and let some point E be taken on EF, and let EG be drawn perpendicular, and let FG be bisected by H, and let HE be joined, and let angle BAG be constructed equal to angle GHE, and let BC be drawn perpendicular, and let AD be made equal to BA, and let CD be joined. Therefore CD is tangent to the section (i. 33).

I say then that

angle CDB = angle EFG.

For since

FG : GH : : DB : BA

and

HG : GE : : AB : BC,

therefore ex aequali

FG : GE : : DB : BC,

And the angles at G and B are right angles, therefore

angle at F = angle at D.

Let the section be a hyperbola, and let it have been done, and let CD be tangent, and let the center of the section Y be taken, and let CY be joined, and let CE be perpendicular; therefore the ratio of rectangle YE, ED to the square on CE is given; for it is the same as the transverse to the upright (i. 37). And the ratio of the square on CE to the square on ED is given; for the angle CDE is given. Therefore the ratio of rectangle YE, ED to the square on ED is given; and so also the ratio of YE to ED is given. And the angle at E is given; therefore the angle at Y is also given.

Then some straight line CY has been drawn across in position with respect to the straight line YE and to the given point Y at a given angle; therefore CY is given in position. And the section is also given in position; therefore the point C is given. And CD has been drawn across as tangent; therefore CD is given in position.

Let the asymptote to the section YF be drawn; therefore CD produced will meet the asymptote (ii. 3). Let it meet it at F. Therefore

angle FDE > angle FYD

Therefore, for the construction, the given acute angle will have to be greater than half the angle contained by the asymptotes.

Then the problem will be constructed thus: let there be the given hyperbola whose axis is AB, and asymptote YF, and the given acute angle KHG greater than angle AYF, and let

angle KHL = angle AYF,

and let AF be drawn from A perpendicular to AB, and let some point G be taken on GH, and let GK be drawn from it perpendicular to HK. Since then

angle FYA = angle LHK,

and also the angles at A and K are right, therefore

YA : AF : : HK : KL

And so also

HK : KL > HK : KG;

therefore also

YA : AF > HK : KG.

But

sq. YA : sq. AF > sq. HK : sq. KG.

But

sq. YA : sq. AF : : transverse : upright (ii. 1);

therefore also

transverse : upright > sq. HK : sq. KG.

If then we shall contrive that

sq. YA : sq. AF : : some other : sq. KG,

it will be greater than the square on HK. Let it be the rectangle MK, KH; and let GM be joined. Since then

sq. MK > rect. MK, KH,

therefore

sq. MK : sq. KG > rect. MK, KH : sq. KG
> sq. YA : sq. AF.

And if we shall contrive that

sq. MK : sq. KG : : sq. YA : some other,

it will be to a magnitude less than the square on AF; and the straight line joined from Y to the point taken will make similar triangles, and therefore

angle AYF > angle GMK.

Let angle AYC be made equal to angle GMK; therefore YC will cut the section (ii. 2). Let it cut it at C, and from C let CD be drawn tangent to the section (ii. 49), and CE drawn perpendicular; therefore triangle CYE is similar to triangle GMK. Therefore

sq. YE : sq. EC : : sq. MK : sq. KG.

But also

transverse : upright : : rect. YE, ED : sq. EC (i. 37),

and

transverse : upright : : rect. MK, KH : sq. KG.

And inversely

sq. CE : rect. YE, ED : : sq. KG : rect. MK, KH;

therefore ex aequali

sq. YE : rect. YE, ED : : sq. MK : rect. MK, KH.

And therefore

YE : ED : : MK : KH.

But also we had

CE : EY : : KG : KM;

therefore ex aequali

CE : ED : : KG : KH.

And the angles at E and K are right angles; therefore

angle at D = angle GHK.

Let the section be an ellipse whose axis is AB. Then it is required to draw a tangent to the section which with the axis will contain, on the same side as the section, an angle equal to the given acute angle.

Let it have been done, and let it be CD. Therefore angle CDA is given. Let CE be drawn perpendicular; therefore the ratio of the square on DE to the square on EC is given. Let Y be the center of the section, and let CY be joined. Then the ratio of the square on CE to the rectangle DE, EY is given; for it is the same as the ratio of the upright to the transverse (i. 37), and therefore the ratio of the square on DE to rectangle DE, EY is given; and therefore the ratio of DE to EY is given. And of DE to EC; therefore also the ratio of CE to EY is given. And the angle at E is right; therefore the angle at Y is given. And it is given with respect to a straight line given in position and to a given point; therefore the point C is given. And from the given point C let CD be drawn tangent; therefore CD is given in position.

Then the problem will be constructed thus: let there be the given acute angle FGH, and let some point F be taken on FG, and let FH be drawn perpendicular, and let it be contrived that

upright : transverse : : sq. FH : rect. GH, HK,

and let KF be joined, and let Y be the center of the section, and let angle AYC be constructed equal to angle GKF, and let CD be drawn tangent to the section (ii. 49).

I say that CD does the problem, that is,

angle CDE = angle FGH.

For since

YE : EC : : KH : FH,

therefore also

sq. YE : sq. EC : : sq. KH : sq. FH.

But also

sq. EC : rect. DE, EY : : sq. FH : rect. KH, HG;

for each is the same ratio as that of the upright to the transverse (i. 37, and above). And ex aequali; therefore

sq. YE : rect. DE, EY : : sq. KH : rect. KH, HG.

And therefore

YE : ED : : KH : HG.

But also

ex aequali, therefore

DE : EC : : HG : FH.

And the sides about the right angles are proportional; therefore

angle CDE = angle FGH.

Therefore CD does the problem.

## Proposition 51 (*Problem*)

Given a section of a cone, to draw a tangent which with the diameter drawn through the point of contact will contain an angle equal to a given acute angle.

Let the given section of a cone first be a parabola whose axis is AB, and the given angle H; then it is required to draw a tangent to the parabola which with the diameter from the point of contact will contain an angle equal to the angle at H.

Let it have been done, and let CD be drawn a tangent making with the diameter EC drawn through the point of contact angle ECD equal to angle H, and let CD meet the axis at D (i. 24). Since then EC is a diameter, it is parallel to the axis AB (Def. i. 6),

angle ADC = angle ECD.

But angle ECD is given; for it is equal to angle H; therefore angle ADC is also given.

Then it will be constructed thus: let there be a parabola whose axis is AB, and the given angle H. Let CD be drawn a tangent to the section making with the axis the angle ADC equal to angle H (ii. 50), and through C let EC be drawn parallel to AB. Since then

angle H = angle ADC,

and

angle ADC = angle ECD,

therefore also

angle H = angle ECD.

Let the section be a hyperbola whose axis is AB, and center E, and asymptote ET, and the given acute angle Q, and let CD be tangent, and let CE be joined doing the problem, and let CG be drawn perpendicular. Therefore the ratio of the transverse to the upright is given; and so also the ratio of rectangle EG, GD to the square on CG (i. 37). Then let some given straight line FH be laid out, and on it let there be described a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to angle Q (*Eucl. iii. 33*); therefore it will be greater than a semicircle (*Eucl. iii. 31*). And from some point K of those on the circumference let KL be drawn perpendicular making

rect. FL, LH : sq. LK : : transverse : upright,

and let FK and KH be joined. Since then

angle FKH = angle ECD,

but also

rect. EG, GD : sq. GC : : transverse : upright,

and

rect. FL, LH : sq. LK : : transverse : upright,

therefore triangle KFL is similar to triangle ECG, and triangle FHK to triangle ECD. And so

angle HFK = angle CED.

Then it will be constructed thus: let there be the given hyperbola AC, and axis AB, and center E, and given acute angle Q, and let the given ratio of the transverse to the upright be the same as YZ to YW, and let WZ be bisected at U, and let a given straight line FH be laid out, and on it let there be described a segment of a circle, greater than semicircle and admitting an angle equal to angle Q (*Eucl. iii. 31, 33*), and let it be FKH, and let the center of the circle X be taken, and from X let XO be drawn perpendicular to FH, and let XO be cut at P in the ratio of UW to WY, and through P let PK be drawn parallel to FH, and from K let KL be drawn perpendicular to FH produced, and let FK and KH be joined, and let LK be produced to M, and from X let XN be drawn perpendicular to it; therefore it is parallel to FH. And therefore

XP : PO or UW : WY : : XK : KL.

And doubling the antecedents

ZW : WY : : MK : KL;

componendo

ZY : YW : : ML : LK.

But

ML : LK : : rect. ML, LK : sq. LK;

therefore

ZY : YW : : rect. ML, LK : sq. LK : : rect. FL, LH : sq. LK (*Eucl. iii. 36*).[^1]

But

ZY : YW : : transverse : upright;

therefore also

rect. FL, LH : sq. LK : : transverse : upright.

Then let AT be drawn from A perpendicular to AB. Since then

sq. EA : sq. AT : : transverse : upright (ii. 1),

and also

transverse : upright : : rect. FL, LH : sq. LK,

and

sq. FL : sq. LK > rect. FL, LH : sq. LK,

therefore also

sq. FL : sq. LK > sq. EA : sq. AT.

And the angles at A and L are right angles; therefore

angle F < angle E.

Then let angle AEC be constructed equal to angle LFK; therefore EC will meet the section (ii. 2). Let it meet it at C. Then let CD be drawn tangent from C (ii. 49), and let CG be drawn perpendicular; then

transverse : upright : : rect. EG, GD : sq. CG (i. 37).

Therefore also

rect. FL, LH : sq. LK : : rect. EG, GD : sq. CG

therefore triangle KFL is similar to triangle ECG, and triangle KHL to triangle CGD, and triangle KFH to triangle CED. And so

angle ECD = angle FKH = angle Q.

And if the transverse and upright are equal, KL touches the circle FKH (*Eucl. iii. 37*), and the straight line joined from the center to K will be parallel to FH and itself will do the problem.

## Proposition 52

If a straight line touches an ellipse making an angle with the diameter drawn through the point of contact, it is not less than the angle adjacent to the one contained by the straight lines deflected at the middle of the section.

Let there be an ellipse whose axes are AB and CD, and center E, and let AB be the major axis, and let the straight line GFL touch the section, and let AC, CB, and FE be joined, and let BC be produced to L. I say that angle LFE is not less than angle LCA.

For FE is either parallel to LB or not.

Let it first be parallel; and

AE = EB;

therefore also

AH = HC.

And FE is a diameter; therefore the tangent at F is parallel to AC (ii. 6). But also FE is parallel to LB; therefore FHCL is a parallelogram, and therefore

angle LFH = angle LCH.

And since AE and EB are each greater than EC, angle ACB is obtuse; therefore angle LCA is acute. And so also angle LFE. And therefore angle GFE is obtuse.

Then let EF not be parallel to LB, and let FK be drawn perpendicular; therefore LBE is not equal to angle FEA. But

rt. angle at E = rt. angle at K;

therefore it is not true that

sq. BE : sq. EC : : sq. EK : sq. KF.

But

sq. BE : sq. EC : : rect. AE, EB : sq. EC : : transverse : upright (i. 21)

and

transverse : upright : : rect. GK, KE : sq. KF (i. 37).

Therefore it is not true that

rect. GK, KE : sq. KF : : sq. KE : sq. KF.

Therefore GK is not equal to KE. Let there be laid out a segment of a circle MUN admitting an angle equal to angle ACB (*Eucl. iii. 33*); and angle ACB is obtuse; therefore MUN is a segment less than a semicircle (*Eucl. iii. 31*). Then let it be contrived that

GK : KE : : NX : XM,

and from X let UXY be drawn at right angles, and let NU and UM be joined, and let MN be bisected at T, and let OTP be drawn at right angles; therefore it is a diameter. Let the center be R, and from it let RS be drawn perpendicular, and ON and OM be joined. Since then

angle MON = angle ACB,

and AB and MN have been bisected, the one at E and the other at T, and the angles at E and T are right angles, therefore triangles OTN and BEC are similar. Therefore

sq. TN : sq. TO : : sq. BE : sq. EC.

And since

TR = SX,

and

RO > SU,

therefore

RO : TR > SU : SX;

and convertendo

RO : OT < SU : UX.

And, doubling the antecedents, therefore

PO : TO < YU : UX.

And separando

PT : TO < YX : UX.

But

PT : TO : : sq. TN : sq. TO : : sq. BE : sq. EC : : transverse : upright (i. 21),

and

transverse : upright : : rect. GK, KE : sq. KF (i. 37);

Therefore

rect. GK, KE : sq. KF < YX : XU
< rect. YX, XU : sq. XU
< rect. NX, XM : sq. XU.

If then we contrive it that

rect. GK, KE : sq. KF : : rect. MX, XN : some other,

it will be greater than the square on XU. Let it be to the square on XW. Since then

GK : KE : : NX : XM,

and KF and YW are perpendicular, and

rect. GK, KE : sq. KF : : rect. MX, XN : sq. XW,

therefore

angle GFE = angle MWN.

Therefore

angle MUN or angle ACB > angle GFE,

and the adjacent angle LFH is greater than angle LCH.

Therefore angle LFH is not less than angle LCH.

## Proposition 53 (*Problem*)

Given an ellipse, to draw a tangent which will make with the diameter drawn through the point of contact an angle equal to a given acute angle; then it is required that the given acute angle be not less than the angle adjacent to the angle contained by the straight lines deflected at the middle of the section.

Let there be the given ellipse whose major axis is AB and minor axis CD, and center E, and let AC and CB be joined, and let angle U be the given angle not less than angle ACG. Therefore angle U is either greater than or equal to angle ACG.

Let it first be equal; and through E let EK be drawn parallel to BC, and through K let KH be drawn tangent to the section (ii. 49). Since then

AE = EB,

and

AE : EB : : AF : FC,

therefore

AF = FC.

And KE is a diameter; therefore the tangent to the section at K, that is HKG, is parallel to CA (ii. 6). And also EK is parallel to CB; therefore KFCG is a parallelogram; and therefore

angle GKF = angle GCF.

And angle GCF is equal to the given angle, that is U; therefore also

angle GKE = angle U.

Then let

angle U > angle ACG;

then inversely

angle F < angle ACB.

Let a circle be laid out, and let a segment be taken from it, and let it be MNP admitting an angle equal to angle U, and let MP be bisected at O, and from O let NOR be drawn at right angles to MP; and let NM and NP be joined; therefore

angle MNP < angle ACB.

But

angle MNO = half angle MNP,

and

angle ACB = half angle ACB;

therefore

angle MNO < angle ACE.

And the angles at E and O are right angles, therefore

AE : EC > OM : ON.

And so also

sq. AE : sq. EC > sq. MO : sq. NO.

But

sq. AE = rect. AE, EB,

and

sq. MO = rect. MO, OP = rect. NO, OR (*Eucl. iii. 35*);

therefore

rect. AE, EB : sq. EC or transverse : upright (i. 21) > RO : ON.

Then let it be that

transverse : upright : : QX : XA,

and let QX be bisected at Y. Since then

transverse : upright > RO : ON,

also

QX : XA > RO : ON.

And componendo

QX : XA > RN : NO.

Let the center of the circle be W; and so also

YX : XA > WN : NO.

And separando

AY : AX > WO : ON.

Then let it be contrived that

AY : AX : : WO : less than ON such as IO, and let IX and XT and WZ be drawn parallel.

Therefore

AY : AX : : WO : OI : : ZY : YX;

and componendo

YX : XA : : ZY : YX.

And doubling the antecedents,

QX : XA : : TY : YX.

[^1]: Pappus, in lemma IX to this book: “Let triangle ABC be similar to triangle DEF, and triangle AGE to DEH; the result is rect. BC, CG : sq. CA : : rect. EF, FH : sq. DF.
“For since because of similarity
whole angle A = whole angle D,
and angle BAG = angle EDH,
therefore remaining angle GAC = remaining angle HDF.
But also angle C = angle F;
therefore GC : CA : : HF : FD
But also BC : CA : : EF : FD;
therefore also compounded ratio is the same with compounded. Therefore
rect. BC, CG : sq. CA : : rect. EF, FH : sq. FD.”

And, *separando*,
QA' : A'X' or transverse : upright : : TS : SX.

Then let MX and XP be joined, and let angle AEK be constructed on straight
line AE at point E equal to angle MPX, and through K let KH be drawn
touching the section (I. 49), and let KL be dropped ordinatewise. Since then

angle MPX = angle AEK,

and

rt. angle at S = rt. angle at L,
therefore triangle XSP is equiangular with triangle KEL.
And

transverse : upright : : TS : SX : : rect. TS, SX :
sq. SX : : rect. MX, SP : sq. SX;

therefore triangle KLE is similar to triangle SXP, and triangle MXP to
triangle KHE, and therefore

angle MXP = angle HKE.

But

angle MXP = angle MNP = angle F;

therefore also

angle HKE = angle Y.

And therefore

adjacent angle GKE = adjacent angle U.

Therefore GH has been drawn tangent to the section and making
with the diameter KE, drawn through the point of contact, angle GKE equal
to the given angle U; and this it was required to do.

## BOOK THREE

### Proposition 1

If straight lines, touching a section of a cone or circumference of a circle, meet, and
diameters are drawn through the points of contact meeting the tangents, the resulting vertically related triangles will be equal.

Let there be the section of a cone or circumference of a circle AB, and let AC
and BD, meeting at E, touch AB, and let the diameters of the section CB and
DA be drawn through A and B, meeting the tangents at C and D.

I say that
trgl. ADE = trgl. EBC.

For let AF be drawn from A parallel to BD; therefore it has been dropped
ordinatewise (I. 32). Then in the case of the parabola
pllg. ADBF = trgl. ACF (I. 42),
and, with the common area AEBF subtracted,
trgl. ADE = trgl. CBE.

And in the case of the others let the diameters meet at center G. Since then
AF has been dropped ordinatewise, and AC touches,
rect. FG, GC = sq. BG (I. 37).

Therefore
FG : GB : : BG : GC;
therefore also
FG : GC : : sq. FG : sq. GB (Eucl. VI. 20).

But
sq. FG : sq. GB : : trgl. AGF : trgl. DGB (Eucl. VI. 19),
and
FG : GC : : trgl. AGF : trgl. AGC;
therefore also
trgl. AGF : trgl. AGC : : trgl. AGF : trgl. DGB.

Therefore
trgl. AGC = trgl. DGB.

Let the common area DGBE be subtracted; therefore as remainders,
trgl. AFD = trgl. CEB.

### Proposition 2

With the same things supposed, if some point is taken on the section or circumference of a circle, and through it parallels to the tangents are drawn as far as the
diameters, then the quadrilateral produced on one of the tangents and one of the
diameters will be equal to the triangle produced on the same tangent and the other
diameter.

For let there be a section of a cone or circumference of a circle AB and let
AEG and BED be tangents, and AD and BC diameters, and let some point G
be taken on the section, and GKL and GMF be drawn parallel to the tangents.

I say that
trgl. AGM = quadr. CLGK.

For triangle GKM has been shown equal to quadrilateral AL (I. 42, 43), let
the common quadrilateral IK be added or subtracted, and
trgl. AGM = quadr. CG.

### Proposition 3

With the same things supposed, if two points are taken on the section or circumference of a circle, and through them parallels to the tangents are drawn as far as the
diameters, the quadrilaterals produced by the straight lines drawn, and standing on
the diameters as bases, are equal to each other.

For let there be the section and tangents and diameters as said before, and
let two points at random F and G be taken on the section, and through F let
the straight lines FHKL and NFIM be drawn parallel to the tangents, and
through G the straight lines GXO and GPR.

I say that
quadr. LG = quadr. MH,

> Eutocius, commenting, gives the proof for another and important case: “It must be
> remarked that, if the point G is taken between A and B so that the parallels are, for instance,
> MIG and LGK, one must draw LK to the section, at N for instance, and through N draw
> NX parallel to BD; for by what was said in the forty-ninth and fiftieth theorems of the first

> But triangle KXM is similar to triangle KMG because MG is parallel to NX; but it is also

> Since then trgl. KNX = quadr. KC = trgl. KMG,

> trgl. AGM = quadr. CG.”
> It will be noticed that, just as in the second note to I. 50, the quadrilateral CG is to be

and
quadr. LN = quadr. RN.

For since it has already been shown that
trgl. RPA = quadr. CG (III. 2),

and
trgl. AMI = quadr. CF (III. 2),

and
trgl. RPA = trgl. AMF + quadr. PM,

therefore also
quadr. CG = quadr. CF + quadr. PM;

and so
quadr. CG = quadr. CH + quadr. RF.

Let the common quadrilateral CH be subtracted; therefore as remainders
quadr. LG = quadr. HM.

And therefore as wholes
quadr. LN = quadr. RN.

### Proposition 4

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet each other, and diameters are
drawn through the points of contact meeting the tangents, then the triangles at the
tangents will be equal.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let the tangents to them, AC
and BC, meet at C, and let D be the center of the sections and let AB and CD
be joined, and CD produced to E, and let DA and BD also be joined and produced to F and G.

I say that
trgl. AGD = trgl. BDF;
and
trgl. ACF = trgl. BCG.

For let HL be drawn through H tangent to the section; therefore it is parallel to AG (I. 44, note). And since
AD = DH (I. 30),
trgl. AGD = trgl. DHL (Eucl. VI. 19).

But
trgl. DHL = trgl. BDF (III. 1);
therefore also
trgl. AGD = trgl. BDF.
And so also
trgl. ACF = trgl. BCG.

### Proposition 5

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and some point is taken on
either of the sections, and from it two straight lines are drawn, the one parallel to
the tangent, the other parallel to the line joining the points of contact, then the
triangle produced by them on the diameter drawn through the point of meeting
differs from the triangle cut off at the point of meeting of the tangents by the triangle cut off on the tangent and the diameter drawn through the point of contact.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B whose center is C, and let tangents ED and DF meet at D, and let EF and CD be joined, and let CD be produced, and let FC and EC be joined and produced, and let some point G be
taken on the section, and through it let HGKL be drawn parallel to EF, and
GM parallel to DF.

I say that triangle GHM differs from triangle KHD by triangle KLF.

For since CD has been shown to be a diameter of the opposite sections (II.
39, 38), and EF to be an ordinate to it (II. 38; First Def. I. 5), and GH has been
drawn parallel to EF, and MG parallel to DF, therefore triangle GHM differs
from triangle CLH by triangle CDF (I. 45, or I. 44, according to the case). And
so triangle GHM differs from triangle KHD by triangle KLF.

And it is evident that
trgl. KLF = quadr. MGKD.

### Proposition 6

With the same things supposed, if some point is taken on one of the opposite sections, and from it parallels to the tangents are drawn meeting the tangents and the
diameters, then the quadrilateral produced by them on one of the tangents and on
one of the diameters will be equal to the triangle produced on the same tangent and
the other diameter.

Let there be opposite sections of which AEC and BED are diameters, and let
AF and BG touch the section AB meeting each other at H, and let some point
K be taken on the section, and from it let KML and KNX be drawn parallel
to the tangents.

I say that
quadr. KLF = trgl. AIN.

Now since AB and CD are opposite sections, and AF, meeting BD, touches
section AB, and KL has been drawn parallel to AF, therefore
trgl. AIN = quadr. KF (III. 2).

> Another and important case where the point K falls between C and D is given by Eutocius
> in his commentary to this proposition. It is as follows: “. . . and let CPR be drawn from C
> tangent to the section; then it is evident that it is parallel to AF and ML (I. 44, note). And
> since it has been shown in the second theorem (III. 2) in the figure of the hyperbola that
> trgl. PNC = quadr. LP (III. 2, note),
> let the common quadrilateral MP be added; therefore
> trgl. MKN = quadr. MLRC.
> Let there be added the common triangle CRE, which is equal to triangle AEF by I. 44, note
> (and I. 30), therefore
> trgl. AEF = quadr. KLEN.
> Let the common quadrilateral FENI be added; therefore, in whole,
> trgl. AIN = quadr. KLFI.
> And likewise also trgl. BOL = quadr. KNGO.”

### Proposition 7

With the same things supposed, if points are taken on each of the sections, and from
them parallels to the tangents are drawn meeting the tangents and the diameters,
then the quadrilaterals produced by the straight lines drawn and standing on the
diameters as bases will be equal to each other.

For let the aforesaid things be supposed, and let points K and L be taken on
both sections, and through them let MKPR and NSTL be drawn parallel
to AF, and NIOK and YWUL parallel to BG.

I say that what was said in the enunciation will be so.

For since
trgl. AOI = quadr. RO (III. 2),
let the quadrilateral EO be added to both; therefore
whole trgl. AEF = quadr. KE.

But also
trgl. BGE = quadr. LE (III. 5, note);

and
trgl. AEF = trgl. BGE (III. 1);

therefore
quadr. LE = quadr. IKRE.

Let the common quadrilateral NE be added; therefore as wholes
whole quadr. TK = quadr. IL,

and also
quadr. KU = quadr. RL.

### Proposition 8

With the same things supposed, instead of K and L let there be taken the
points C and D at which the diameters hit the sections, and through them let
the parallels to the tangents be drawn.

I say that
quadr. DG = quadr. FC
and
quadr. XI = quadr. OT.

For since it was shown
trgl. AGH = trgl. HBF (III. 1),
and the straight line from A to B is parallel to the straight line from G to F,
therefore
AE : EG : : BE : EF;
and *convertendo*
EA : AG : : EB : BF.

And also
CA : AE : : DB : BE;

> For the point H falls within the angle AEB (II. 25), and the straight line drawn from H
> to the midpoint of AB, that is S, is a diameter (II. 29), and must therefore pass through E
> (I. 51, end). An analogous series of propositions is found for the opposite sections: II. 32,
> 38, 39.
> Then, since trgl. GHA = trgl. FHB;
> therefore trgl. GFB = trgl. GFA.
> Their bases are the same, therefore their heights are equal (Eucl. VI. 1).

for each is double the other; therefore *ex aequali*
CA : AG : : DB : BF.

And the triangles are similar because of the parallels; therefore
trgl. CTA : trgl. AHG : : trgl. XBD : trgl. HBF (Eucl. VI. 19).
And alternately; but
trgl. AHG = trgl. HBF (III. 1);
therefore
trgl. CTA = trgl. XBD.

As parts of these it was shown
trgl. AHG = trgl. HBF;
therefore also as remainders
quadr. CTGH = quadr. XBFH.

And so also
quadr. DG = quadr. CF.

And since CO is parallel to AF,
trgl. COE = trgl. AEF.

And likewise also
trgl. DEI = trgl. BEG.

But
trgl. BEG = trgl. AEF (III. 1);

therefore also
trgl. COE = trgl. DEI.

And also
quadr. DG = quadr. CF (above).

Therefore, as wholes,
quadr. XI = quadr. OT.

### Proposition 9

With the same things supposed, if one of the points is between the diameters,
as K, and the other is the same with one of the points C and D, for instance C,
and the parallels are drawn, I say that
trgl. CEO = quadr. KE;
quadr. LO = quadr. LM.

And this is evident. For since it was shown
trgl. CEO = trgl. AEF,

and
trgl. AEF = quadr. KE (III. 5, note),

therefore also
trgl. CEO = quadr. KE.

And so also
trgl. CRM = quadr. KO,
and
quadr. KC = quadr. LO.

### Proposition 10

With the same things supposed, let K and L be taken not as points at which
the diameters hit the sections.

Then it is to be shown that
quadr. LTRY = quadr. QYKI.

For since the straight lines AF and BG touch, and AE and BE are diameters
through the points of contact, and LT and KI are parallel to the tangents,
trgl. TUE = trgl. UQL + trgl. EFA (I. 44).

And likewise also
trgl. XEI = trgl. XRK + trgl. BEG.

But
trgl. EFA = trgl. BEG (III. 1);

therefore
trgl. TUE - trgl. UQL = trgl. XEI - trgl. XRK.

Therefore
trgl. TUE + trgl. XRK = trgl. XEI + trgl. UQL.

Let the common area KXEULY be added; therefore
quadr. LTRY = quadr. QYKI.

### Proposition 11

With the same things supposed, if some point is taken on either of the sections, and
from it parallels are drawn, one parallel to the tangent and the other parallel to the
straight line joining the points of contact, then the triangle produced by them on the
diameter drawn through the point of meeting of the tangents differs from the triangle cut off on the tangent and the diameter drawn through the point of contact
by the triangle cut off at the point of meeting of the tangents.

Let there be the opposite sections AB and CD, and let the tangents AE and
DE meet at E, and let the center be H, and let AD and EHG be joined, and let
some point B be taken at random on the section AB, and through it let BFL be
drawn parallel to AG, and BM parallel to AE.

I say that triangle BFM differs from triangle AKL by triangle KEF.

For it is evident that AD is bisected by EH (II. 39, and II. 29), and that EH is
a diameter conjugate to the diameter drawn through H parallel to AD (II. 38);
and so AG is an ordinate to EG (First Def. I. 6).

Since then GE is a diameter, and AE touches, and AG is an ordinate, and,
with point B taken on the section, BF has been dropped to EG parallel to AG,
and BM parallel to AE, therefore it is clear that triangle BMF differs from
triangle LHF by triangle HAE (I. 45; I. 43). And so also triangle BMF differs
from triangle AKL by triangle KFE.

And it has been proved at the same time that
quadr. BKEM = trgl. LKA.

> That is, in the first case,
> trgl. BMF = trgl. LHF + trgl. HAE (I. 45);
> in the second case, only the more general statement “differs” holds true (I. 43). It will be
> noticed these are different cases of I. 43 and I. 45 from those given in the text itself.

### Proposition 12

With the same things being so, if on one of the sections two points are taken, and
parallels are drawn from each of them, likewise the quadrilaterals produced by
them will be equal.

For let there be the same things as before, and let the points S and K be
taken at random on section AB, and through them let LBMN and KXO be
drawn parallel to AD, and BXR and LKS parallel to AE.

I say that
quadr. SS = quadr. KR.

For since it has been shown
trgl. AOP = quadr. KOES (III. 11, end)
and
trgl. AMN = quadr. BMER (III. 11, end),
therefore, as remainders, either
quadr. KR - quadr. SO = quadr. MP
or
quadr. KR + quadr. SO = quadr. MP.

And, with the common quadrilateral SO added or subtracted,
quadr. SS = quadr. XS.

### Proposition 13

If in conjugate opposite sections straight lines tangent to the adjacent sections
meet, and diameters are drawn through the points of contact, then the triangles
whose common vertex is the center of the opposite sections will be equal.

Let there be conjugate opposite sections on which there are the points A, B,
C and D, and let BE and AE, meeting at E, touch the sections A and B, and
let H be the center, and let AH and BH be joined and produced to D and C.

I say that
trgl. BFH = trgl. AGH.

For let AK and LHM be drawn through A and H parallel to BE. Since then
BFE touches the section B, and DHB is a diameter through the point of contact, and LM is parallel to BE, LM is a diameter conjugate to diameter BD,
the so-called second diameter (II. 20); and therefore AK has been drawn ordinatewise to BD. And AG touches; therefore
rect. KH, HG = sq. BH (I. 38).

Therefore
KH : HB : : BH : GH.

But
KH : HB : : KA : BF : : AH : HF;

therefore also
AH : HF : : BH : GH.

And the angles BHF and GHF are equal to two right angles; therefore
trgl. AGH = trgl. BHF.

### Proposition 14

With the same things supposed, if some point is taken on any one of the sections,
and from it parallels to the tangents are drawn as far as the diameters, then the
triangle produced at the center will differ from the triangle produced about the
same angle by the triangle having the tangent as base, and center as vertex.

Let the other things be the same, and let some point X be taken on section
AB, and through it let XRS be drawn parallel to AG and XTO parallel to BE.

I say that triangle OHT differs from triangle XST by triangle HBF.

For let AU be drawn from A parallel to BF. Since then, because of the same
things as before, LHM is a diameter of the section AL, and DHB is a second
diameter and conjugate to it (II. 20), and AG is a tangent at A, and AU has
been dropped parallel to LM, therefore
AU : UG comp. HU : UA,
transverse side of figure on LM : upright (I. 40).

But
AU : UG : : XT : TS,

and
HU : UA : : HT : TO : : HB : BF,

and
transverse side of figure on LM : upright : :
upright side of figure on BD : transverse (I. 60).

Therefore
XT : TS comp. HB : BF, upright side of figure on BD : transverse
or
XT : TS comp. HT : TO, upright side of figure on BD : transverse.

And by things shown in the forty-first theorem of the first book (I. 41), triangle
THO differs from triangle XTS by triangle BFH.

And so also by triangle AGH (III. 13).

### Proposition 15

If straight lines touching one of the conjugate opposite sections meet, and diameters
are drawn through the points of contact, and some point is taken on any one of the
conjugate sections, and from it parallels to the tangents are drawn as far as the
diameters, then the triangle produced by them at the section is greater than the
triangle produced at the center by the triangle having the tangent as base, and the
center of the opposite sections as vertex.

> This proposition comes as a climax to a long series, and shows that the conjugate opposite
> sections taken as a unit have the same property as the other conic sections. The conjugate
> opposite sections seem to be a sort of fifth section.

Let there be conjugate opposite sections AB, GS, T, and X, whose center is
H, and let ADE and BDC touch the section AB, and let the diameters AHFW
and BHT be drawn through the points of contact A and B, and let some point
S be taken on the section GS, and through it let SFL be drawn parallel to BC
and SU parallel to AE.

I say that
trgl. SLU = trgl. HLF + trgl. HCB.

For let XHG be drawn through H parallel to BC, and KIG through G parallel
to AE, and SO parallel to BT; then it is evident that XG is a diameter conjugate to BT (II. 20), and that SO being parallel to BT has been dropped ordinatewise to HGO (First Def. I. 6), and that SLHO is a parallelogram.

Since then BC touches, and BH is through the point of contact, and AE is
another tangent, let it be contrived that
DB : BE : : MN : 2BC;
therefore MN is the so-called upright side of the figure on BT (I. 50). Let MN
be bisected at P; therefore
DB : BE : : MP : BC.

Then let it be contrived that
XG : TB : : TB : R; (α)
then R also will be the so-called upright side of the figure applied to XG
(I. 16, 60).

Since then
DB : BE : : MP : BC, (β)

but
DB : BE : : sq. DB : rect. DB, BE,

and
MP : BC : : rect. MP, BH : rect. CB, BH,
therefore
sq. DB : rect. DB, BE : : rect. MP, BH : rect. CB, BH.

And
rect. MP, BH = sq. HG,
because
sq. XG = rect. TB, MN (I. 16) (γ)
and
rect. MP, BH = fourth rect. TB, MN
and
sq. HG = fourth sq. XG;
therefore
sq. DB : rect. DB, BE : : sq. HG : rect. CB, BH.

Alternately
sq. DB : sq. HG : : rect. DB, BE : : rect. CB, BH.

But
sq. DB : sq. HG : : trgl. DBE : trgl. GHI;
for they are similar; and
rect. DB, BE : rect. CB, BH : : trgl. DBE : trgl. CBH;

therefore
trgl. GHI = trgl. CBH.

Again since
HB : BC comp. HB : MP, MP : BC,

but
HB : MP : : TB : MN : : R : XG (above, α and γ),
and
MP : BC : : DB : BE (above, β)

therefore
HB : BC comp. DB : BE, R : XG.

And since BC is parallel to SL, and triangle HCB is similar to triangle HLF,
and
HB : BC : : HL : LF,

therefore
HL : LF comp. R : XG, DB : BE
or
HL : LF comp. R : XG, HG : HI.

Since then GS is an hyperbola having XG as a diameter, and R as an upright
side, and, from some point S, SO has been dropped ordinatewise, and figure
HIG has been described on radius HG, and figure HLF has been described on
the ordinate SO or its equal HL, and on HO the straight line between the center and the ordinate or on SL its equal the figure SLU has been described similar to the figure HIG described on the radius, and there are the compounded
ratios as already given, therefore
trgl. SLU = trgl. HLF + trgl. HCB (I. 41).

### Proposition 16

If two straight lines touching a section of a cone or circumference of a circle meet,
and from some point of those on the section a straight line is drawn parallel to one
tangent and cutting the section and the other tangent, then, as the squares on the
tangents are to each other, so the area contained by the straight lines between the
section and the tangent will be to the square cut off at the point of contact.

Let there be the section of a cone or circumference of a circle AB, and let the
straight lines AC and CB, meeting at C, touch it, and let some point D be
taken on the section AB, and through it let EDF be drawn parallel to CB.

I say that
sq. BC : sq. AC : : rect. FE, ED : sq. EA.

For let the diameters AGH and KBL be drawn through A and B, and DMN
through D parallel to AL; it is at once evident, that
DK = KF (I. 46, 47),

and
trgl. AEG = quadr. LD (III. 2),
and
trgl. BLC = trgl. ACH (III. 1).

Since then
DK = KF
and DE is added,
rect. FE, ED + sq. DK = sq. KE.

And since triangle ELK is similar to triangle DNK,
sq. EK : sq. KD : : trgl. EKL : trgl. DNK.

And alternately
whole sq. EK : whole trgl. ELK : :
part subtracted sq. DK : part subtracted trgl. DNK.

Therefore also
remainder rect. FE, ED : remainder quadr. DL : : sq. EK : trgl. ELK.

But
sq. EK : trgl. ELK : : sq. CB : trgl. BEC;

therefore also
rect. FE, ED : quadr. LD : : sq. CB : trgl. LCB.

But
quadr. LD = trgl. AEG,
and
trgl. BLC = trgl. ACE;

therefore also
rect. FE, ED : trgl. AEG : : sq. CB : trgl. ACE.

Alternately
rect. FE, ED : sq. CE : : trgl. AEG : trgl. ACE.

But
trgl. AEG : trgl. ACE : : sq. EA : sq. AC;

therefore also
rect. FE, ED : sq. CB : : sq. EA : sq. AC.

And alternately.

### Proposition 17

If two straight lines touching a section of a cone or circumference of a circle meet,
and two points are taken at random on the section, and from them in the section
are drawn parallel to the tangents straight lines cutting each other and the line of
the section, then as the squares on the tangents are to each other, so will the rectangles contained by the straight lines taken similarly.

Let there be the section of a cone or circumference of a circle AB; and tangents to AB, AC and CB, meeting at C; and let points D and E be taken at
random on the section, and through them let EFIK and DFGH be drawn parallel to AC and CB.

I say that
sq. CA : sq. CB : : rect. KF, FE : rect. HF, FD.

For let the diameters ALMN and BOXP be drawn through A and B, and let
the tangents and parallels be produced to the diameters, and let DX and EM
be drawn from D and E parallel to the tangents; then it is evident that
KI = IE, HG = GD (I. 46, 47).

Since then KE has been cut equally at I and unequally at F,
rect. KF, FE + sq. FI = sq. EI (Eucl. II. 5).

And since the triangles are similar because of the parallels,
whole sq. EI : whole trgl. IME : :
part subtracted sq. IF : part subtracted trgl. FIL.

Therefore also
remainder rect. KF, FE : remainder quadr. FM : : whole
sq. EI : whole trgl. IME.

But
sq. EI : trgl. IME : : sq. CA : trgl. CAN.

Therefore
rect. KF, FE : quadr. FM : : sq. CA : trgl. CAN.

But
trgl. CAN = trgl. CPB (III. 1),
and
quadr. FM = quadr. FX (III. 3);

therefore
rect. KF, FE : quadr. FX : : sq. CA : trgl. CPB.

Then likewise it could be shown that
rect. HF, FD : quadr. FX : : sq. CB : trgl. CPD.

Since then
rect. KF, FE : quadr. FX : : sq. CA : trgl. CPD,

and inversely
quadr. FX : rect. HF, FD : : trgl. CPB : sq. CB,

therefore *ex aequali*
sq. CA : sq. CB : : rect. KF, FE : rect. HF, FD.

### Proposition 18

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and some point is taken on
either one of the sections, and from it some straight line is drawn parallel to one of
the tangents cutting the section and the other tangent, then as the squares on the
tangents are to each other, so will the rectangle contained by the straight lines
between the section and the tangent be to the square on the straight line cut off at
the point of contact.

Let there be the opposite sections AB and MN, and tangents ACL and BCH,
and through the points of contact the diameters AM and BN, and let some
point D be taken at random on the section MN, and through it let EDF be
drawn parallel to BH.

I say that
sq. BC : sq. CA : : rect. FE, ED : sq. AE.

For let DX be drawn through D parallel to AE. Since then AB is an hyperbola and BN its diameter and BH a tangent and DF parallel to BH, therefore
FO = OD (I. 48).

And ED is added: therefore
rect. FE, ED + sq. DO = sq. EO (Eucl. II. 6).

And since EL is parallel to DX, triangle EOL is similar to triangle DXO.
Therefore
whole sq. EO : whole trgl. EOL : :
part subtracted sq. DO : part subtracted trgl. DXO;
therefore also
remainder rect. DE, EF : remainder quadr. DL : : sq. EO : trgl. EOL.

But
sq. OE : trgl. EOL : : sq. BC : trgl. BCL;

therefore also
rect. FE, ED : quadr. DL : : sq. BC : trgl. BCL.

And
quadr. DL = trgl. AEG (III. 6, note),
and
trgl. BCL = trgl. ACH (III. 1);

therefore
rect. FE, ED : trgl. AEG : : sq. BC : trgl. ACH.

But also
trgl. AEG : sq. EA : : trgl. ACH : sq. AC;

Therefore *ex aequali*
sq. BC : sq. AC :: rect. FE, ED : sq. EA.

> Eutocius gives an alternative proof of Apollonius', demonstrating another and important case: “For let there be the opposite sections A and B, and tangents to them AC and CB meeting at C, and let D be taken on section B, and through it let EDF be drawn parallel to AC. I say that
>
> sq. AC : sq. CB :: rect. EF, FD : sq. FB.
>
> “For let AHG be drawn as a diameter through A, and through B and G, GK and BL parallel to EF. Since then BH touches the hyperbola at B, and BL has been drawn ordinate-wise, AL : LG :: AH : HG (i. 36).

## Proposition 19

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and parallels to the tangents are drawn cutting each other and the section, then, as the squares on the tangents are to each other, so will the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the section and the point of meeting of the straight lines be to the rectangle contained by the straight lines taken similarly.

Let there be opposite sections whose diameters are AC and BD and center in E, and let the tangents AF and FD meet at F, and let GHIKL and MNXOL be drawn from any points parallel to AF and FD.

I say that
sq. AF : sq. FD :: rect. GL, LI : rect. ML, LX.

Let IP and XR be drawn through X and I parallel to AF and FD.

And since
sq. AF : trgl. AFS :: sq. HL : trgl. HLO :: sq. HI : trgl. HIP,
therefore
remainder rect. GL, LI : remainder quadr. IPOL :: sq. AF : trgl. AFS.
But
trgl. AFS = trgl. DTF (iii. 4),
and
quadr. IPOL = quadr. KRXL (iii. 7);
therefore also
sq. AF : trgl. DTF :: rect. GL, LI : quadr. KRXL.
But
trgl. DTF : sq. FD :: quadr. KRXL : rect. ML, LX (likewise);
and therefore *ex aequali*
sq. AF : sq. FD :: rect. GL, LI : rect. ML, LX.

## Proposition 20

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and through the point of meeting some straight line is drawn parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact and meeting each of the sections, and some other straight line is drawn parallel to the same straight line and cutting the sections and the tangents, then, as the rectangle contained by the straight lines drawn from the point of meeting to cut the sections is to the square on the tangent, so is the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the sections and the tangent to the square on the straight line cut off at the point of contact.

Let there be the opposite sections AB and CD whose center is E and tangents AF and CF, and let AC be joined, and let EF and AE be joined and produced, and let BFH be drawn through F parallel to AC, and let the point K be taken at random, and through it let KLSMNX be drawn parallel to AC.

I say that
rect. BF, FD : sq. FA :: rect. KL, LX : sq. AL.

For let KP and BR be drawn from K and B parallel to AF. Since then
sq. BF : trgl. BFR :: sq. KS : trgl. KSP :: sq. LS : trgl. LSF,
and
sq. KS : trgl. KSP ::
remainder rect. KL, LX (Eucl. ii. 5) :
remainder quadr. KLFP (Eucl. v. 19).

and
sq. BF = rect. BF, FD (ii. 39, 38),
and
trgl. BRF = trgl. AFH (iii. 11 and special case),
and
quadr. KLFP = trgl. ALN (iii. 5),
therefore
rect. BF, FD : trgl. AFH :: rect. KL, LX : trgl. ALN.
And
trgl. AFH : sq. AF :: trgl. ALN : sq. AL;
then
rect. BF, FD : sq. FA :: rect. KL, LX : sq. AL.

## Proposition 21

With the same things supposed, if two points are taken on the section, and through them straight lines are drawn, the one parallel to the tangent, the other parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and cutting each other and the sections, then, as the rectangle contained by the straight lines drawn from the point of meeting to cut the sections is to the square on the tangent, so will the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the sections and the point of meeting be to the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the section and the point of meeting.

For let there be the same things as before, and let points G and K be taken, and through them let NXGOPR and KST be drawn parallel to AF, and GLM and KOWIYZQ parallel to AC.

I say that
rect. BF, FD : sq. FA :: rect. KO, OQ : rect. NO, OG.

For since
sq. AF : trgl. AFH :: sq. AL : trgl. ALM :: sq. XO : trgl. XOZ
and
sq. XO : trgl. XOZ :: sq. XG : trgl. XGM,
therefore whole sq. XO : whole trgl. XOZ ::
part subtracted sq. XG : part subtracted trgl. XGM,
therefore also
remainder rect. NO, OG : remainder quadr. GOZM :: sq. AF : trgl. AFH.
But
trgl. AFH = trgl. BFU (iii. 11, end, special case),
and
quadr. GOZM = quadr. KORT (iii. 12);
therefore
sq. AF : trgl. BFU :: rect. NO, OG : quadr. KORT.
But it was shown (in the course of iii. 20) trgl. BFU : sq. BF or rect. BF, FD (ii. 39, 38) :: quadr. KORT : rect. KO, OQ;
therefore *ex aequali*
sq. AF : rect. BF, FD :: rect. NO, OG : rect. KO, OQ.
And inversely
rect. BF, FD : sq. FA :: rect. KO, OQ : rect. NO, OG.

## Proposition 22

If two parallel straight lines touch opposite sections, and any straight lines are drawn cutting each other, and the sections, one parallel to the tangent, the other parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, then as the transverse side of the figure on the straight line joining the points of contact is to the upright, so the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the sections and the point of meeting will be to the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the section and the point of meeting.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and let AC and BD be parallel and tangent to them, and let AB be joined. Then let EXG be drawn across parallel to AB and KELM parallel to AC.

I say that
AB : upright side of the figure :: rect. GE, EX : rect. KE, EM.

Let XN and GE be drawn through G and X parallel to AC.

For since AC and BD are parallels tangent to the sections, AB is a diameter (ii. 31), and KL, XX, and GF are ordinates to it (i. 32); then (i. 21)
AB : upright side ::
rect. BL, LA : sq. LK :: rect. BX, XA : sq. XX or sq. LK
Therefore
whole rect. BL, LA : whole sq. LK ::
part subtracted rect. BX, NA : part subtracted sq. LE,

or
rect. BL, LA : sq. LK :: rect. FA, AX : sq. LE,
for
NA = BF (i. 21);
therefore also
remainder rect. FL, LX : remainder rect. KE, EM :: AB : upright.
But
rect. FL, LX = rect. GE, EX;
therefore
AB the transverse side of figure : upright ::
rect. GE, EX : rect. KE, EM.

## Proposition 23

If in conjugate opposite sections two straight lines touching contrary sections meet in any one section at random, and any straight lines are drawn parallel to the tangents and cutting each other and the other opposite sections, then, as the squares on the tangents are to each other, so the rectangle contained by the straight lines between the sections and the point of meeting will be to the rectangle contained by the straight lines similarly taken.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections AB, CD, EF, and GH, and their center E, and let ATFCL and EYDL, tangents to the sections AB and EF
meet at L, and let AK and EK be joined and produced to B and F, and let GMXXO be drawn from G parallel to AL, and HPRXS from H parallel to EL.

I say that
sq. EL : sq. LA :: rect. HX, XS : rect. GX, XO.

For let ST be drawn through S parallel to AL, and OU from O parallel to EL. Since then BE is a diameter of the conjugate opposite sections AB, CD, EF and GH, and EL touches the section, and HS has been drawn parallel to it, HP = PS (ii. 20; First Def. i. 5),
and for the same reasons
GM = MO

And since
sq. EL : trgl. EWL :: sq. PS : trgl. PTS :: sq. PX : trgl. PNX,
also
remainder rect. HX, XS : remainder quadr. TX, XS :: sq. EL : trgl. WLE.
But
trgl. EWL = trgl. ALY (iii. 4),
and
quadr. TX, XS = quadr. XRUO (iii. 15);
therefore
sq. EL : trgl. ALY :: rect. HX, XS : quadr. XRUO.
But
trgl. AYL : sq. AL :: quadr. XRUO : rect. GX, XO (same way);
therefore *ex aequali*
sq. EL : sq. AL :: rect. HX, XS : rect. GX, XO.

> This is the case of iii. 15 where the tangents are one to each of the opposite sections. Compare with the two cases of iii. 12 and iii. 18.
> For trgl. PTS = trgl. APP = trgl. ANK (iii. 15),
> and trgl. MOU = trgl. MXK = trgl. ANK (iii. 15).

## Proposition 24

If in conjugate opposite sections two straight lines are drawn from the center through to the sections, and one of them is taken as the transverse diameter and the other as the upright diameter, and any straight lines are drawn parallel to the two diameters and meeting each other and the sections, and the point of meeting of the straight lines is the place between the four sections, then the rectangle contained by the straight lines contained by the segments of the parallel to the transverse diameter together with the rectangle to which the rectangle contained by the segments of the parallel to the upright diameter has the ratio which the square on the upright diameter has to the square on the transverse, will be equal to twice the square on the half of the transverse.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C and D whose center is E, and from E let the transverse diameter AEC and the upright diameter DEB be drawn through, and let FGHIKL and MNXOPR be drawn parallel to AC and DB and meeting each other at X; and first let X be within the angle SEW or the angle UET.

I say that the rectangle FX, XL together with the rectangle to which the rectangle RX, XM has the ratio which the square on DB has to the square on AC, is equal to twice the square on AE.

For let the asymptotes of the sections SET and UEW be drawn, and through A, SGAW tangent to the section.

Since then
rect. SA, AW = sq. DE (i. 60; ii. 1),

therefore
rect. SA, AW : sq. EA :: sq. DE : sq. EA.
And
rect. SA, AW : sq. AE comp. SA : AE, WA : AE.
But
SA : AE :: NX : XH
and
WA : AE :: PX : XK;
therefore
sq. DE : sq. AE comp. NX : XH, PX : XK.
But
rect. PX, XN : rect. KX, XH comp. NX : XH, PX : XK;
therefore
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. PX, XN : rect. KX, XH.
Therefore also
sq. DE : sq. AE :: sq. AE + rect. PX, XN : sq. AE + rect. KX, XH.

And
sq. DE = rect. PM, MN (ii. 11) = rect. RN, NM (ii. 16),
and
sq. AE = rect. KF, FH (ii. 11) = rect. LH, HF (ii. 16);
therefore
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. PX, XN + rect. RN, NM :
rect. KX, XH + rect. LH, HF
And
rect. PX, XN + rect. RN, NM = rect. RX, XM;
therefore
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. RX, XM : rect. KX, XH + rect. KF, FH.

Then it must be shown that
rect. FX, XL + rect. KX, XH + rect. KF, FH = 2 sq. AE.

Let the common square AE, that is rectangle KF, FH, be subtracted; therefore it remains to be shown that
rect. FX, XL + rect. FX, XF = sq. AE.

And this is so; for
rect. FX, XL + rect. FX, XF = rect. LH, HF,
rect. FX, XL + rect. FX, XF = rect. KF, FH (ii. 16),
= sq. AE (ii. 11).

Then let the straight lines FL and MR meet on one of the asymptotes at H. Then
rect. FH, HL = sq. AE,
and
rect. MH, HR = sq. DE (ii. 11, 16);
therefore
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. MH, HR : rect. FH, HL.

And so we want twice rectangle FH, HL to equal twice the square on AE.
And it does.

> For RP = NM (ii. 8),
> and RO = OM (ii. 3),
> therefore PO = ON.
> But rect. PX, XN + sq. OX = sq. ON (Eucl. ii. 5),
> and, for the same reasons,
> rect. RN, NM + sq. ON = sq. OM,
> and rect. RX, XM + sq. OX = sq. OM.
> Hence rect. RN, NM + sq. ON = rect. RX, XM + sq. OX,
> and, adding equals to equals,
> rect. RN, NM + sq. ON + rect. PX, XN + sq. OX = rect. RX, XM + sq. OX + sq. ON.
> Subtracting the common squares,
> rect. RN, NM + rect. PX, XN = rect. RX, XM.

> By the same manner of proof as in the note above, but using also Euclid ii. 6, because of the different position of the point X.

And let the point X be within the angle SEK or angle WET. Then likewise by the composition of ratios.
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. PX, XN : rect. KX, XH.

And
sq. DE = rect. PM, MN = rect. RX, XM,
and
sq. AE = rect. FH, HL;
therefore
rect. RX, XM : rect. FH, HL ::
part subtracted rect. PX, XN : part subtracted rect. KX, XH.
Therefore also
rect. RX, XM : rect. FH, HL ::
remainder rect. RX, XM : remainder (sq. AE - rect. KX, XH)
Therefore it must be shown that
rect. FX, XL + (sq. AE - rect. KX, XH) = 2 sq. AE.

Let the common square on AE, that is rectangle FH, HL, be subtracted; therefore it remains to be shown that
rect. KX, XH + (sq. AE - rect. KX, XH) = sq. AE.

And this is so; for
rect. KX, XH + sq. AE - rect. KX, XH = sq. AE.

## Proposition 25

With the same things supposed, let the point of meeting of the parallels to AC and BD be within one of the sections D and B, as set out below, at X.

I say that the rectangle contained by the segments of the parallel to the transverse, that is rectangle OX, XN, will be greater than the rectangle to which the rectangle contained by the segments of the parallel to the upright diameter, that is rectangle RX, XM, has the ratio which the square on the upright diameter has to the square on the transverse by twice the square on the half of the transverse.

For, for the same reasons,
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. PX, XH : rect. SX, XL.
and
sq. DE = rect. PM, MH,
and
sq. AE = rect. LO, OS (ii. 11);
therefore also
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. PM, MH : rect. LO, OS.

And since
whole rect. PX, XH : whole rect. LX, XS ::
part subtracted rect. PM, MH : part subtracted rect. LO, OS,
or rect. ST, TL (ii. 22),
therefore also
remainder rect. RX, XM : remainder rect. TX, XK
(first note to iii. 24; ii. 8) :: sq. DE : sq. AE.

Therefore it must be shown that
rect. OX, XN = rect. TX, XK + 2 sq. AE.

Let the common rectangle TX, XK be subtracted; therefore it must be shown that
rect. OT, TN (first note to iii. 24) = 2 sq. AE.

And it is (ii. 23).

## Proposition 26

And if the point of meeting of the parallels at X is within one of the sections A and C, as set out below, then the rectangle contained by the segments of the parallel to the transverse, that is rectangle LX, XF, will be less than the rectangle to which the rectangle contained by the segments of the other parallel, that is rectangle RX, XG, has the ratio which the square on the upright diameter has to the square on the transverse by twice the square on half of the transverse.

For, since for the same reasons as before
sq. DE : sq. AE :: rect. FX, XL : rect. KX, XH,
therefore also
whole rect. RX, XG : whole rect. KX, XH + sq. AE ::
sq. upright diameter : sq. transverse.

Therefore it must be shown that
rect. LX, XF + 2 sq. AE = rect. KX, XH + sq. AE.

> For by ii. 11 rect. DE;
> and RW = GS (ii. 16).
> Therefore by the first note to iii. 24, and ii. 16,
> rect. WX, XS + sq. DE = rect. WX, XS + rect. WG, GS = rect. RX, XG.

Let the common square on AE be subtracted; therefore it remains to be shown that
rect. LX, XF + sq. AE = rect. KX, XH
or
rect. LX, XF + rect. LH, HF = rect. KX, XH. (ii. 16, 11).

And it is, for
rect. LH, HF + rect. LX, XF = rect. KX, XH.

> This is another case of the first note to iii. 24.

## Proposition 27

If the conjugate diameters of an ellipse or circumference of a circle are drawn, and one of them is called the upright diameter and the other the transverse, and two straight lines, meeting each other and the line of the section, are drawn parallel to them, then the squares on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the transverse between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the line of the section plus the figures described on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the upright diameter between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the line of the section, figures similar and similarly situated to the figure on the upright diameter, will be equal to the square on the transverse diameter.

For let there be the ellipse or circumference of a circle ABCD, whose center is E, and let two of its conjugate diameters be drawn, the upright AEC and the transverse BED, and let NGFH and KFLM be drawn parallel to AC and BD.

I say that the squares on NF and FH plus the figures described on KF and FM, similar and similarly situated to the figure on AC, will be equal to the square on BD.

Let NX be drawn from N parallel to AE; therefore it has been dropped ordinatewise to BD. And let BP be the upright side. Now since
BP : AC :: AC : BD (i. 15),
therefore also
BP : BD :: sq. AC : sq. BD.
And
sq. BD = figure on AC;
therefore
BP : BD :: sq. AC : figure on AC.

And
sq. AC : figure on AC ::
sq. NX : figure on NX similar to the figure on AC (Eucl. vi. 22);

therefore also
BP : BD :: sq. NX : figure on NX similar to the figure on AC.
And also
BP : BD :: sq. NX : rect. BX, XD (i. 21);
therefore
figure on NX or FL similar to the figure on AC = rect. BX, XD.

Then likewise we could show that
figure on KL similar to the figure on AC = rect. BL, LD.

And since the straight line NH has been cut equally at G and unequally at F,
sq. HF + sq. FN = 2[sq. HG + sq. GF] = 2[sq. XG + sq. GF] (Eucl. ii. 9).
Then for the same reasons also
sq. MF + sq. FK = 2[sq. KL + sq. LF],
and the figure on MF and FK similar to the figure on AC are double the similar figures on KL and LF.

And
figure on NX + figure on FL = rect. BX, XD + rect. BL, LD (above),
therefore
sq. NF + sq. FH + figures on KF and FM similar to the figure on AC =
2[rect. BX, XD + rect. BL, LD + sq. NX + sq. FL].

And since the straight line BD has been cut equally at E and unequally at X,
rect. BX, XD + sq. NX = sq. BE (Eucl. ii. 5).
And likewise also
rect. BL, LD + sq. LF = sq. BE;
and so
rect. BX, XD + rect. BL, LD + sq. NX + sq. LF = 2 sq. BE.
Therefore the squares on NF and FH together with figures on KF and FM similar to the figure on AC are double the square on BE. But also
sq. BD = 2 sq. BE;
therefore the squares on NF and FH plus the figures on KF and FM similar to the figure on AC are equal to the square on BD.

## Proposition 28

If in conjugate opposite sections conjugate diameters are drawn, and one of them is called the upright, and the other the transverse, and two straight lines are drawn parallel to them and meeting each other and the sections, then the squares on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the upright between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the sections have to the squares on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the transverse between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the sections the ratio which the square on the upright diameter has to the square on the transverse diameter.

Let there be the conjugate opposite sections A, B, C, and D and let AEC be the upright diameter and BED the transverse, and let FGHK and LGMN be drawn parallel to them and cutting each other and the sections.

I say that
sq. LG + sq. GN : sq. FG + sq. GK :: sq. AC : sq. BD.

For let LX and FO be drawn ordinatewise from F and L; therefore they are parallel to AC and BD. And from B let the upright side for BD, BP, be drawn; then it is evident that
PB : BD :: sq. AC : sq. BD (i. 15) :: sq. AE : sq. EB ::
sq. FO : rect. BO, OD (i. 21) :: rect. CX, XA : sq. LX (i. 60, 21).
Therefore as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all of the antecedents to all of the consequents (Eucl. v. 12); therefore
sq. AC : sq. BD :: rect. CX, XA + sq. AE + sq. OF : rect. DO, OB + sq. BE + sq. LX

sq. AC : sq. BD :: rect. CX, XA + sq. AE + sq. EH :
rect. DO, OB + sq. BE + sq. ME.

But
rect. CX, XA + sq. AE = sq. XE,
and
rect. DO, OB + sq. BE = sq. OE (Eucl. ii. 6);
therefore
sq. AC : sq. BD :: sq. XE + sq. EH : sq. OE + sq. EM ::
sq. LM + sq. MG : sq. FH + sq. HG.

And, as has been shown,
sq. NG + sq. GL = 2[sq. LM + sq. MG],
and
sq. FG + sq. GK = 2[sq. FH + sq. HG] (Eucl. ii. 9);
therefore also
sq. AC : sq. BD :: sq. NG + sq. GL : sq. FG + sq. GK.

## Proposition 29

With the same things supposed, the parallel to the upright diameter cuts the asymptotes, then squares on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the upright between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the asymptotes plus the half of the square on the upright diameter has to the squares on the straight lines cut off on the straight line drawn parallel to the transverse between the point of meeting of the straight lines and the sections the ratio which the square on the upright diameter has to the square on the transverse.

For let there be the same things as before, and let NL cut the asymptotes at X and O.

It is to be shown that
sq. XG + sq. GO + half sq. AC : sq. FG + sq. GK :: sq. AC : sq. BD,
or
sq. XG + sq. GO + 2 sq. AE : sq. FG + sq. GK :: sq. AC : sq. BD.

For since
LX = ON (ii. 16),
sq. LG + sq. GN + 2 rect. NX, XL = sq. XG + sq. GO;
therefore
sq. XG + sq. GO + 2 sq. AE = sq. LG + sq. GN.

And
sq. LG + sq. GN : sq. FG + sq. GK :: sq. AC : sq. BD (iii. 28);
therefore also
sq. XG + sq. GO + 2 sq. AE : sq. FG + sq. GK :: sq. AC : sq. BD.

> For OM = MX.
> Therefore, as in a lemma of Pappus, since
> 2 rect. NX, XL + 2 sq. MX = 2 sq. ML (Eucl. ii. 5),
> adding the common square on GM,
> 2 rect. NX, XL + 2 sq. MX + 2 sq. GM = 2 sq. ML + 2 sq. GM.
> And
> 2 sq. ML + 2 sq. GM = sq. NG + sq. GL
> and
> 2 sq. MX + 2 sq. GM = sq. OG + sq. GX (Eucl. ii. 9).
> Therefore as above.

## Proposition 30

If two straight lines touching an hyperbola meet, and through the points of contact a straight line is produced, and through the point of meeting a straight line is drawn parallel to some one of the asymptotes and cutting both the section and the straight line joining the points of contact, then the straight line between the point of meeting and the straight line joining the points of contact will be bisected by the section.

Let there be the hyperbola
ABC, and let AD and DC be
tangents and EF and FG
asymptotes, and let AC be
joined, and through D paral¬
lel to FE let DKL be drawn.
I say that
DK = KL.

For let FDBM be joined
and produced both ways, and
let FH be made equal to BF,
and through the points B and
K let BE and KN be drawn
parallel to AC; therefore they have been dropped ordinatewise (ii. 30, 5, 7).
And since triangle BEF is similar to triangle DNK, therefore
sq. DN : sq. NK :: sq. BF : sq. BE. (α)
And
sq. BF : sq. BE :: HB : upright (ii. 1);
therefore also
sq. DN : sq. NK :: HB : upright.
But
HB : upright :: rect. HN, NB : sq. NK (i. 21);
therefore also
sq. DN : sq. NK :: rect. MN, NB : sq. NK.
Therefore
rect. HN, NB = sq. DN.

> The propositions from 30 to 34 inclusive are one special case, and propositions 35 and 36 are another special case of proposition 37. The first group takes the line drawn through the intersection of the tangents as parallel to an asymptote. The second group takes one of the tangents as an asymptote. Proposition 34, lying between, is special in both these ways.
> In proposition 37 we have the line CF divided by the section at D and F, and at E by the straight line joining the points of contact, in such a way that
> CF : CD :: FE : ED.
> This is the same form of the harmonic proportion as we found in i. 34, and DF is the harmonic mean between CF and FE.
> If we argue by analogy from this proportion, treating infinity as a definite magnitude, and two such infinities as would occur here as equal and subject to the general laws of magnitudes, we can immediately deduce the special cases of propositions 30 to 36. Thus in the case of the first group, CF and FE both become infinite, therefore CD is equal to ED.

And also
rect. MF, FD = sq. FB (i. 37),
because AD touches and AM has been dropped ordinatewise; and so also
rect. HN, NB + sq. FB = rect. MF, FD + sq. DN.
But
rect. HN, NB + sq. FN = sq. DN (Eucl. ii. 6);
and therefore
rect. MF, FD + sq. DN = sq. DN.
Therefore DM has been bisected at N with DF added (Eucl. ii. 6). And KN and LM are parallel; therefore
DK = KL.

## Proposition 31

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and a straight line is produced through the points of contact, and through the point of meeting a straight line is drawn parallel to the asymptote and cutting both the section and the straight line joining the points of contact, then the straight line between the point of meeting and the straight line joining the points of contact will be bisected by the section.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B, and tangents AC and CB, and let AB be joined and produced, and let FE be an asymptote and through C let CGH be drawn parallel to FE.

I say that
CG = GH.

Let CE be joined and produced to D, and through E and G let NEKM and GX be drawn parallel to AB, and through G and K let KF and GL be drawn parallel to CD.

Since triangle KFE is similar to triangle MLG,
sq. KE : sq. KF :: sq. ML : sq. LG.
And it has been shown
sq. KE : sq. KF :: rect. NL, LK : sq. LG (α and β of iii. 30);
therefore
rect. NL, LK = sq. ML.
Let the square on KE be added to each; therefore
rect. NL, LK + sq. KE = sq. LE = sq. GX = sq. ML + sq. KE.
And
sq. GX : sq. ML + sq. KE :: sq. XC : sq. LG + sq. KF (Eucl. vi. 4; v. 12);
therefore
sq. XC = sq. LG + sq. KF.

And
sq. LG = sq. XE
and
sq. KF = sq. on half of second diameter (ii. 1),
= rect. CE, ED (i. 38);
therefore
sq. XC = sq. XE + rect. CE, ED.

Therefore the straight line CD has been cut equally at X and unequally at E (Eucl. ii. 5).
And DH is parallel to GX; therefore
CG = GH.

## Proposition 32

If two straight lines touching an hyperbola meet, and a straight line is produced through the points of contact, and a straight line is drawn through the point of meeting of the tangents parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and a straight line is drawn through the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact parallel to one of the asymptotes, then the straight line cut off between this midpoint and the parallel will be bisected by the section.

Let there be the hyperbola ABC, whose center is D, and asymptote DE, and let AF and FC touch, and let CA and FD be joined and produced to G and H;
then it is evident that
AH = HC.

Then let FK be drawn
through F parallel to AC,
and HLK through H paral¬
lel to DE.

I say that
KL = HL.

Let LM and BE be drawn

through B and L parallel to AC; then, as has been already shown (III. 30, α, and β, and conclusion),
sq. DB : sq. BE :: sq. HM : sq. ML :: rect. BM, MG : sq. ML;
therefore
rect. GM, MB = sq. MH.

And also
rect. HD, DF = sq. DB.
because AF touches, and AH has been dropped ordinatewise (I. 37); therefore
rect. GM, MB + sq. DB = rect. HD, DF + sq. MH = sq. DM (*Eucl.* II. 6).
Therefore FH has been bisected at M with DF added. And KF and LM are parallel; therefore
KL = LH.

## Proposition 33

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and one straight line is produced through the points of contact, and another straight line is drawn through the point of meeting of the tangents parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and still another straight line is drawn through the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact parallel to one of the asymptotes and meeting the section, and the parallel drawn through the point of meeting, then the straight line between the midpoint and the parallel will be bisected by the section.

Let there be the opposite sections ABC and DEF, and tangents AG and DG and center H, and asymptote KH, and let HG be joined and produced, and also let ALD be joined; then it is evident that it is bisected at L (II. 30). Then let BHE and CGF be drawn through G and H parallel to AD, and LMN through L parallel to HK.

I say that
LM = MN.

For let EK and MX be dropped from E and M parallel to GH, and MP through M parallel to AD.

Since then through things already shown (III. 30, α and β)
sq. HE : sq. EK :: rect. BX, XE : sq. XM,
therefore
sq. HE : sq. EK :: rect. BX, XE + sq. HE : sq. KE + sq. XM. (*Eucl.* V. 12)
or
sq. HE : sq. EK :: sq. HX : sq. KE + sq. XM (*Eucl.* II. 6).

But it has been shown (I. 38; II. 1)
sq. EK = rect. GH, HL
and
sq. XM = sq. HP;
therefore
sq. HE : sq. EK :: sq. HX or sq. MP : rect. GH, HL + sq. HP.
And
sq. HE : sq. EK :: sq. MP : sq. PL (*Eucl.* VI. 4);
therefore
sq. MP : sq. PL :: sq. MP : rect. GH, HL + sq. HP.
Therefore
sq. PL = rect. GH, HL + sq. HP.

Therefore the straight line LG has been cut equally at P and unequally at H (*Eucl.* II. 5).

And MP and GN are parallel; therefore
LM = MN.

## Proposition 34

If some point is taken on one of the asymptotes of an hyperbola, and a straight line from it touches the section, and through the point of contact a parallel to the asymptote is drawn, then the straight line drawn from the point taken parallel to the other asymptote will be bisected by the section.

Let there be the hyperbola AB, and the asymptotes CD and DE, and let a point C be taken at random on CD, and through it let CBE be drawn touching the section, and through B let FBG be drawn parallel to CD, and through C let CAG be drawn parallel to DE.

I say that
CA = AG.

For let AH be drawn through A parallel to CD, and BK through B parallel to DE. Since then
CB = BE (II. 3),
therefore also
CK = KD
and
DF = FE.

And since
rect. KB, BF = rect. CA, AH (II. 12),
and
BF = DK = CK,
and
AH = DC,
therefore
rect. DC, CA = rect. GC, CK.
Therefore
DC : CK :: GC : CA.

And
CD = 2CK;
therefore also
GC = 2 CA.
Therefore
CA = AG.

## Proposition 35

With the same things being so, if from the point taken some straight line is drawn cutting the section at two points, then as the whole straight line is to the straight line cut off outside, so will the segments of the straight line cut off inside be to each other.

For let there be the hyperbola AB and the asymptotes CD and DE, and CBE touching and HB parallel, and through C let some straight line CALFG be drawn across cutting the section at A and F.

I say that
FC : CA :: FL : AL.

For let CNX, KAM, OPBR, and FU be drawn through C, A, B and F parallel to DE; and APS and TFRMX through A and F parallel to CD. Since then
AC = FG (II. 8),
therefore also
KA = TG (*Eucl.* VI. 4).
But
KA = DS;
therefore also
TG = DS.
And so also
CK = DU.
And since
CK = DU,
also
DK = CU;
therefore
DK : CK :: CU : CK.

And
CU : CK :: FC : AC,
and
FC : AC :: MK : KA,
and
MK : KA :: parallelogram MD : parallelogram DA (*Eucl.* VI. 1),
and
DK : CK :: parallelogram HK : parallelogram KN;
therefore also
parallelogram MD : parallelogram DA :: parallelogram HK : parallelogram KN.
But
parallelogram DA = parallelogram DB (II. 12) = parallelogram ON;
for
CB = BE (II. 3),
and
DO = OC;
therefore
parallelogram MD : parallelogram ON :: parallelogram HK : parallelogram KN.

And
remainder parallelogram MH : remainder parallelogram BK :: whole parallelogram MD : whole parallelogram OX
And since
parallelogram DA = parallelogram DB,
let the common parallelogram DP be subtracted;
therefore
parallelogram KP = parallelogram PH.
Let the common parallelogram AB be added; therefore
whole parallelogram BK = whole parallelogram AH.
Therefore
parallelogram MD : parallelogram DA :: parallelogram MH : parallelogram AH.
But
parallelogram MD : parallelogram DA :: MK : KA :: FC : AC,
parallelogram MH : parallelogram AH :: MW : WA :: FL : LA;
therefore also
FC : AC :: FL : LA.

## Proposition 36

With the same things being so, if the straight line drawn across from the point neither cuts the section at two points nor is parallel to the asymptote, it will meet the opposite section, and as the whole straight line is to the straight line between the section and the parallel through the point of contact, so will the straight line between the opposite section and the asymptote be to the straight line between the asymptote and the other section.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B whose center is C and asymptotes DE and FG, and let some point G be taken on CG, and from it let GBE be drawn tangent, and GH neither parallel to CE nor cutting the section in two points (I. 26).

It has been shown that GH produced meets CD and therefore also section A. Let it meet it at A, and let KBL be drawn through B parallel to CG.

I say that
AK : KH :: AG : GH.

For let HM and AX be drawn from the points A and H parallel to CG, and BX, GP, and RHSN from B, G and H parallel to DE. Since then
AD = GH (II. 16),
AG : GH :: DH : HG
But
AG : GH :: NS : SH;
and
DH : GH :: CS : SG;
And therefore
NS : SH :: CS : SG.
But
NS : SH :: parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH,
and
CS : SG :: parallelogram RC : parallelogram RG;
therefore also
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: parallelogram RC : parallelogram RG.
And as one is to one so are all to all; therefore
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: whole parallelogram NL : whole parallelogram CH + parallelogram RG.
And since
EB = BG,
also
LB = BP
and
parallelogram LX = parallelogram BG.
And
parallelogram LX = parallelogram CH (II. 12);
therefore also
parallelogram BG = parallelogram CH.
Therefore
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: whole parallelogram NL : whole parallelogram BG + parallelogram RG
or
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: parallelogram NL : parallelogram RX.
But
parallelogram RX = parallelogram LH,
since also
parallelogram CH = parallelogram BC (II. 12),
and
parallelogram MB = parallelogram XH.
Therefore
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: parallelogram NL : parallelogram LH.
But
parallelogram NC : parallelogram CH :: NS : SH :: AG : GH,
and
parallelogram NL : parallelogram LH :: NR : RH :: AK : KH;
therefore also
AK : KH :: AG : GH.

## Proposition 37

If two straight lines touching a section of a cone or circumference of a circle or opposite sections meet, and a straight line is joined to their points of contact, and from the point of meeting of the tangents some straight line is drawn across cutting the line (of the section) at two points, then as the whole straight line is to the straight line cut off outside, so will the segments produced by the straight line joining the points of contact be to each other.

Let there be the section of a cone AB and tangents AC and CB and let AB be joined, and let CDEF be drawn across.

I say that
CF : CD :: FE : ED.

Let the diameters CH and AK be drawn through C and A, and through F and D, DP, FR, LFM and NDO parallel to AH and LC. Since then LFM is parallel to XDO,
FC : CD :: LF : XD :: FM : DO :: LM : XO;
and therefore
sq. LM : sq. XO :: sq. FM : sq. DO.

But
sq. LM : sq. XO :: triangle LMC : triangle XCO (*Eucl.* VI. 19)
sq. FM : sq. DO :: triangle FRM : triangle DPO;
therefore also
triangle LMC : triangle XCO :: triangle FRM : triangle DPO ::
:: remainder quadrilateral LCRF : remainder quadrilateral XCPD.
But
quadrilateral LCRF = triangle ALK (III. 2; III. 11),
and
quadrilateral XCPD = triangle ANX (III. 2; III. 11);
therefore
sq. LM : sq. XO :: triangle ALK : triangle ANX.
But
sq. LM : sq. XO :: sq. FC : sq. CD,
and
triangle ALK : triangle ANX :: sq. LA : sq. AX :: sq. FE : sq. ED;
therefore also
sq. FC : sq. CD :: sq. FE : sq. ED.

And therefore
FC : CD :: FE : ED.

## Proposition 38

With the same things being so, if some straight line is drawn through the point of meeting of the tangents parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and a straight line drawn through the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact cuts the section in two points and the straight line through the point of meeting parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, then as the whole straight line drawn across is to the straight line cut off outside between the section and the parallel, so will the segments produced by the straight line joined to the points of contact be to each other.

Let there be the section AB and tangents AC and BC and AB the straight line joining the points of contact, and AN and CM diameters; then it is evident that AB has been bisected at E (II. 30, 39).

Let CO be drawn from C parallel to AB, and let FEDO be drawn across through E.

I say that
FO : OD :: FE : ED.

For let LFKM and DHGXN be drawn through F and D parallel to AB, and through F and G, FR and GP parallel to LC. Then likewise as before (III. 37) it will be shown that
sq. LM : sq. XH :: sq. LA : sq. AX.
And
sq. LM : sq. XH :: sq. LC : sq. CX ::
sq. FO : sq. OD,
and
sq. LA : sq. AX :: sq. FE : sq. ED;
therefore
sq. FO : sq. OD :: sq. FE : sq. ED,
and
FO : OD :: FE : ED.

## Proposition 39

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and a straight line is produced through the points of contact, and a straight line drawn from the point of meeting of the tangents cuts both of the sections and the straight line joining the points of contact, then as the whole straight line drawn across is to the straight line cut off outside between the section and the straight line joining the points of contact, so will the segments of the straight line produced by the segments and the point of meeting of the tangents be to each other.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B whose center is C and tangents AD and DB, and let AB and CD be joined and produced, and through D let some straight line EDFG be drawn across.

I say that
EG : GF :: ED : DF.

For let AC be joined and produced, and through E and F let EHS and FLMNXO be drawn parallel to AB, and parallel to AD, EP and FR.

Since then FX and ES are parallel, and EF, XS, and HM have been drawn through to them,
EH : HS :: FM : MX.

And alternately
EH : FM :: HS : MX;
therefore also
sq. EH : sq. FM :: sq. HS : sq. MX.

But
sq. EH : sq. FM :: triangle EHP : triangle FRM,
and
sq. HS : sq. MX :: triangle DHS : triangle XMD;
Therefore also
triangle EHP : triangle FRM :: triangle DHS : triangle XMD.
And
triangle EHP = triangle ASK + triangle DHS (III. 11),
and
triangle FRM = triangle ANX + triangle XMD (III. 11);
therefore
triangle DHS : triangle XMD :: triangle ASK + triangle DHS : triangle ANX + triangle XMD,
and
remainder triangle ASK : remainder triangle ANX :: triangle DHS : triangle XMD.
But
triangle ASK : triangle ANX :: sq. LA : sq. AX :: sq. EG : sq. FG;*
and
triangle DHS : triangle XMD :: sq. HD : sq. DM :: sq. ED : sq. DF.
Therefore also
EG : FG :: ED : DF.

*For
EG : TG :: KA : TA,
TG : TF :: TA : TX,
TG - TF : TG :: TA - TX : TA;
Therefore, ex aequali,
EG : FG :: KA : AX.

## Proposition 40

With the same things being so, if a straight line is drawn through the point of meeting of the tangents parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and if a straight line drawn from the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact cuts both of the sections and the straight line parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, then as the whole straight line drawn across is to the straight line cut off outside between the parallel and the section, so will the straight line's segments produced by the sections and the straight line joining the points of contact be to each other.

Let there be the opposite sections A and B whose center is C, and tangents AD and DB, and let AB and CDE be joined; therefore
AE = EB (II. 39).
And from D let FDG be drawn parallel to AB, and from E, LE at random.

I say that
HL : LK :: HE : EK.

From H and K let NMHX and KOP be drawn parallel to AB, and HR and KS parallel to AD, and let XACT be drawn through.

Since then XAU and MAP have been drawn across the parallels XM and KP,
XA : AU :: MA : AP.
But
XA : AU :: HE : EK;
and
HE : EK :: HX : KO
because of the similarity of the triangles HEX and KEO; therefore
HX : KO :: MA : AP;
therefore also
sq. HX : sq. KO :: sq. MA : sq. AP.

But
sq. HX : sq. KO :: triangle HRN : triangle KSO;
and
sq. MA : sq. AP :: triangle XMA : triangle AUP;
therefore also
triangle HRN : triangle KSO :: triangle XMA : triangle AUP.
And
triangle HRN = triangle XMA + triangle MND (III. 11),
and
triangle KSO = triangle AUP + triangle DOP (III. 11);
therefore also
triangle XMA + triangle MND : triangle AUP + triangle DOP :: triangle XMA : triangle AUP;
therefore also
remainder triangle NMD : remainder triangle DOP :: whole : whole.
But
triangle XMA : triangle AUP :: sq. XA : sq. AU;
and
triangle NMD : triangle DOP :: sq. MN : sq. PO;
therefore also
sq. MN : sq. PO :: sq. XA : sq. AU.
But
sq. MN : sq. PO :: sq. ND : sq. PO,
and
sq. XA : sq. AU :: sq. HE : sq. EK,
and
sq. ND : sq. PO :: sq. HL : sq. LK;
therefore also
sq. HE : sq. EK :: sq. HL : sq. LK.
Therefore
HE : EK :: HL : LK.

## Proposition 41

If straight lines touching a parabola meet each other, they will be cut in the same ratio.

Let there be the parabola ABC, and tangents APE, EFC and FBD.

I say that
CF : FE :: ED : DA :: FB : BD.
For let AC be joined and bisected at G.

Then it is evident that the straight line from E to G is a diameter of the section (II. 29).

If then it goes through B, DF is parallel to AC (II. 5) and will be bisected by EG, and therefore
AD = DE (I. 35),
and
CF = FE (I. 35),
and what was sought is apparent.

Let it not go through B, but through H, and let KHL be drawn through H parallel to AC; therefore it will touch the section at H (I. 32), and because of things already said (I. 35),
AK = KE
and
LC = LE.

Let MNBX be drawn through B parallel to EG, and AO and CP through A and C parallel to DF. Since then MB is parallel to EH, MB is a diameter (I. 40; I. 51, end); and DF touches at B; therefore AO and CP have been dropped ordinatewise (II. 5; *First Def.* I. 4). And since MB is a diameter, and CM a tangent, and CP an ordinate,
MB = BP (I. 35),
and so also
MF = FC.
And since
MF = FC
and
EL = LC,
and alternately
MC : CF :: EC : CL;
But
MC : EC :: CF : CL.
MC : EC :: XC : CG;
therefore also
CF : CL :: XC : CG.
And
CL : EC :: CG : CA;
therefore ex aequali
CA : XC :: EC : CF,
and convertendo
EC : FE :: CA : AX;
separando
CF : FE :: XC : AX.

Again since MB is a diameter and AN a tangent and AO an ordinate,
NB = BO (I. 35),
and
ND = DA.
And also
EK = KA;
therefore
AE : KA :: NA : DA;
alternately
AE : NA :: KA : DA.
But
AO : NA :: GA : AX;
therefore also
KA : DA :: GA : AX.
And also
AE : KA :: CA : GA;
therefore, ex aequali,
AE : DA :: CA : AX;
separando,
ED : DA :: XC : AX.
And it was also shown
XC : AX :: CF : FE;
therefore
CF : EF :: ED : DA.
Again since
XC : AX :: CP : AO,
and
CP = 2BF,
and
CM = 2 MF;
and
AO = 2BD,
and
AN = 2AO,
therefore
XC : AX :: FB : BD :: CF : FE :: ED : DA.

## Proposition 42

If an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle or opposite sections straight lines are drawn from the vertex of the diameter parallel to an ordinate, and some other straight line at random is drawn tangent, it will cut off from them straight lines containing a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the figure to the same diameter.

For let there be some one of the aforesaid sections, whose diameter is AB, and from A and B let AC and DB be drawn parallel to an ordinate, and let some other straight line CED be tangent at E.

I say that
rect. AC, BD = fourth part of figure to AB.

For let its center be F, and through it let FG be drawn parallel to AC and BD. Since then AC and BD are parallel, and FG is also parallel, therefore it is the diameter conjugate to AB (*First Def.* I. 6); and so
sq. FG = fourth part of figure to AB (*Second Def.* I. 3).

If then FG goes through E in the case of the ellipse and circle,
AC = FG = BD (II. 7),
and it is immediately evident that
rect. AC, BD = sq. FG or fourth part of figure to AB.

Then let it not go through it, and let DC and BA produced meet at K, and let EL be drawn through E parallel to AC, and EM parallel to AB.

Since then
rect. AF, FL = sq. AF (I. 37),
KF : AF :: AF : FL,
and
inversely
componendo or separando
Therefore also
Therefore
KA : AL :: KF : AF or FB (*Eucl.* V. 19);
FB : KF :: AL : KA;
BK : KF :: LK : KA.
DB : FH :: EL : CA.
rect. DB, CA = rect. FH, EL,
= rect. HF, FM.

But
rect. HF, FM = sq. FG (I. 38),
= fourth figure to AB (*Second Def.* I. 11);
therefore also
rect. DB, CA = fourth figure to AB.

## Proposition 43

If a straight line touch an hyperbola, it will cut off from the asymptotes, beginning with the center of the section, straight lines containing a rectangle equal to the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off by the tangent at the section's vertex at its axis.

Let there be the hyperbola AB, and asymptotes CD and DE, and axis BD, and let FBG be drawn through B tangent, and some other tangent at random, CAH.

I say that
rect. FD, DG = rect. CD, DH.

For let AK and BL be drawn from A and B parallel to DG, and AM and BN parallel to CD. Since then CAH touches,
CA = AH (II. 3);
and so
CH = 2AH
and
CD = 2 AM
and
DH = 2AK.
Therefore
rect. CD, DH = 4 rect. KA, AM.
Then likewise it could be shown
rect. FD, DG = 4 rect. LB, BN.
But
rect. KA, AM = rect. LB, BN (II. 12).
Therefore also
rect. CD, DH = rect. FD, DG.
Then likewise it could be shown, even if DB were some other diameter and not the axis.

## Proposition 44

If two straight lines touching an hyperbola or opposite sections meet the asymptotes, then the straight lines drawn to the sections will be parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact.

For let there be either the hyperbola or the opposite sections AB, and asymptotes CD and DE, and tangents CAHF and EBHG, and let AB, EG, and CE be joined.

I say that they are parallel.

For since
rect. CD, DF = rect. GD, DE (III. 43),
therefore
CD : DE :: GD : DF;
therefore CE is parallel to FG. And therefore
HF : FC :: HG : GE.

And
FC : AF :: GE : GF;
for each is double (II. 3); therefore ex aequali
HG : GB :: HF : FA.
Therefore FG is parallel to AB.

## Proposition 45

If in an hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle or opposite sections straight lines are drawn from the vertex of the axis at right angles, and a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the figure is applied to the axis on each side and exceeding by a square figure in the case of the hyperbola and opposite sections, but deficient in the case of the ellipse, and some straight line is drawn tangent to the section and meeting the perpendicular straight lines, then the straight lines drawn from the points of meeting to the points produced by the application make right angles at the aforesaid points.
Let there be one of the sections mentioned whose axis is AB, and AC and BD

> 1 “The points of application” are in modern terminology the foci of the conics. The circle is seen here as an ellipse whose two foci or focal points coincide with the center. This theory is, of course, a special application of *Euclid* VI. 28 and 29, two theorems on which depends one whole side of Greek geometry.
>
> Apollonius never speaks of the focus of the parabola, but it can be found by analogy with the ellipse.
>
> Thus in the ellipse above
> rect. AF, FB = fourth rect. AB, R
> where R is the parameter. Or
> rect. AF, (AB - AF) = fourth rect. AB, R
> or
> AF : fourth R :: AB : (AB - AF).
>
> Then if we consider the ellipse as its axis, AB gets as large as we please; we can think of it as approaching as near as we please to a parabola with parameter R. The ratio AB : (AB - AF) approaches as near as we please to equality and hence also the ratio

at right angles, and CED tangent, and let the rectangle AF, FB and the rectangle AG, GB equal to the fourth part of the figure be applied on each side (*Eucl.* VI. 28, 29), as has been said, and let CF, CG, DF, and DG be joined.

I say that angle CFD and angle CGD are each a right angle.

For since it has been shown
rect. AC, BD = fourth figure on AB (III. 42),
and since also
rect. AF, FB = fourth figure on AB,
therefore
rect. AC, BD = rect. AF, FB.
Therefore
AC : AF :: FB : BD.
And the angles at points A and B are right; therefore
angle ACF = angle BFD (*Eucl.* VI. 6),
and
angle AFC = angle FDB.
And since angle CAF is right, therefore
angle ACF + angle AFC = 1 rt. angle.
And it has also been shown that
angle ACF = angle DFB:
therefore
angle AFC + angle DFB = 1 right angle.
Therefore
angle DFC = 1 right angle.
Then likewise it could also be shown
angle CGD = 1 right angle.

## Proposition 46

With the same things being so, the straight lines joined make equal angles with the tangents.

For with the same things supposed, I say that
angle ACF = angle DCG
and
angle CDF = angle BDG.

For since it has been shown that both angle CFD and angle CGD are right angles (III. 45), the circle described about CD as a diameter will pass through points F and G; therefore
angle DCG = angle DFG;
for they are on the same segment of the circle. And it was shown
angle DFG = angle ACF (III. 45);
and so
angle DCG = angle ACF.
And likewise also
angle CDF = angle BDG.

## Proposition 47

With the same things being so, the straight line drawn from the point of meeting of the joined straight lines to the point of contact will be perpendicular to the tangent.

For let the same things as before be supposed and let CG and FD meet each other at H, and let CD and BA produced meet at K, and let EH be joined.

I say that EH is perpendicular to CD.

For if not, let HL be drawn from H perpendicular to CD. Since then
angle CDF = angle GBD (III. 46),
and also
rt. angle DBC = rt. angle DLH,
therefore triangle DGB is similar to triangle LHD. Therefore
GD : DH :: BD : DL.
But
GD : DH :: FC : CH
because the angles at F and G are right angles (III. 45) and the angles at H are equal; but
FC : CH :: AC : CL
because of the similarity of the triangles AFC and LCH (III. 46); therefore also
BD : DL :: AC : CL.
Alternately
BD : AC :: DL : CL.
But
BD : AC :: BK : KA:
therefore also
DL : CL :: BK : KA.

Let EM be drawn from E parallel to AC; therefore it will have been dropped ordinatewise to AB (II. 7); and
BK : KA :: BM : MA.

And
BM : MA :: DE : EC;
therefore also
DL : CL :: DE : EC;
and this is absurd. Therefore HL is not perpendicular nor is any other straight line except HE.*

> *There is the analogous theorem for the parabola. FD becomes a straight line parallel to
> CE and CG a straight line parallel to AB. Again HE is perpendicular to CE, and this can be proved rigorously as well as understood by analogy.

## Proposition 48

With the same things being so, it must be shown that the straight lines drawn from the point of contact to the points produced by the application make equal angles with the tangent.

For let the same things be supposed, and let EF and EG be joined.

I say that
angle CEF = angle GED.

For since angles DGH and DEH are right angles (III. 45, 47), the circle described about DH as a diameter will pass through the points E and G (*Eucl.* III. 31); and so
angle DHG = angle DEG (*Eucl.* III. 21);
for they are in the same segment. Likewise then also
angle CEF = angle CHF.
But
angle CHF = angle DHG;
for they are vertical angles; therefore also
angle CEF = angle DEG.*

> *Here there is another and important analogous theorem for the parabola. EG becomes parallel to AB, and
> angle DEG = angle CEF.

## Proposition 49

With the same things being so, if from one of the points (of application) a perpendicular is drawn to the tangent, then the straight lines from that point to the ends of the axis make a right angle.

For let the same things be supposed, and let the perpendicular GH be drawn from G to CD, and let AH and BH be joined.

I say that angle AHB is a right angle.

For since angle DBG is a right angle and also angle DHG, the circle described about DG as a diameter will pass through H and B, and
angle BHG = angle BDG.
But it was shown
angle AGC = angle BDG (III. 46);
therefore also
angle BHG = angle AGC = angle AHC (*Eucl.* III. 21).
And so also
angle CHG = angle AHB.
But angle CHG is a right angle; therefore also angle AHB is a right angle.

## Proposition 50

With the same things being so, if from the center of the section there falls to the tangent a straight line parallel to the straight line drawn through the point of contact and one of the points (of application), then it will be equal to one half the axis.

For let there be the same things as before and let H be the center, and let EF be joined, and let DC and BA meet at K, and through H let HL be drawn parallel to EF.

I say that

HL = HB.

For let EG, AL, LG be joined, and through G let GM be drawn parallel to EF. Since then

rect. AF, FB = rect. AG, GB (See iii. 45),

therefore

AF = GB.

But also
AH = HB;
therefore also
FH = HG.

And so also

EL = LM.

And since it was shown (iii. 48)

angle CEF = angle DEG,

and

angle CEF = angle EMG,

therefore also

angle EMG = angle DEG.

And therefore

EG = GM.

But it was also shown

EL = LM

therefore GL is perpendicular to EM. And so through what was shown before (iii. 49) angle ALB is a right angle, and the circle described about AB as a diameter will pass through L. And

HA = HB;

therefore also, since HL is a radius of the semicircle,

HL = HB.

## Proposition 51

If a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the figure is applied from both sides to the axis of a hyperbola or opposite sections and exceeding by a square figure, and straight lines are deflected from the resulting points of application to either one of the sections, then the greater of the two straight lines exceeds the less by exactly as much as the axis.

For let there be a hyperbola or opposite sections whose axis is AB and center C, and let each of the rectangles AD, DB and AE, EB be equal to the fourth part of the figure, and from points E and D let the straight lines EF and FD be deflected to the line of the section.

I say that

EF = FD + AB

Let FKH be drawn tangent through F, and GCH through C parallel to FD; therefore

angle KHG = angle KFD;
for they are alternate. And

angle KFD = angle GFH (iii. 48);

therefore

GF = GH.

But
since also
GF = GE,
AE = BD
and
AC = CB
and
EC = CD;
and therefore
GH = EG.

And so

FE = 2GH.

And since it has been shown (iii. 50)

CH = CB *

therefore

FE = 2(GC + CB).

But

FD = 2GC,

and

AB = 2CB;

therefore

FE = FD + AB.

And so EF is greater than FD by AB.

*For GF = GH, and, by iii. 50, a line C(X) drawn parallel to GF is equal to CB. But also C(X) = CH. Hence CH = CB.

## Proposition 52

If in an ellipse a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the figure is applied from both sides to the major axis and deficient by a square figure, and from the points resulting from the application straight lines are deflected to the line of the section, then they will be equal to the axis.

Let there be an ellipse, whose major axis is AB, and let each of the rectangles AC, CB and AD, DB be equal to the fourth of the figure, and from C and D let the straight lines CE and ED have been deflected to the line of the section.

I say that

CE + ED = AB.

Let FEH be drawn tangent, and G be center, and through it let GKH be drawn parallel to CE. Since then

Angle CEF = angle HEK (iii. 48),

and

angle CEF = angle EHK,

therefore also
angle EHK = angle HEK.
Therefore also
HK = KE.
And since
AG = GB,
and
AC = DB,
therefore also
CG = GD;
and so also
EK = KD.

And for this reason

ED = 2HK,

and

EC = 2KG,

and

ED + EC = 2GH.

But also
AB = 2GH (iii. 50);
therefore
AB = ED + EC.

## Proposition 53

If in a hyperbola or ellipse or circumference of a circle or opposite sections straight lines are drawn from the vertex of a diameter parallel to an ordinate, and straight lines drawn from the same ends to the same point on the line of the section cut the parallels, then the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off is equal to the figure on that same diameter.

Let there be one of the aforesaid sections ABC whose diameter is AC, and let AD and CE be drawn parallel to an ordinate, and let ABE and CBD be drawn across.

I say that

rect. AD, EC = figure on AC.

For let BF be drawn from B parallel to an ordinate.

Therefore

rect. AF, FC : sq. FB :: transverse side : upright side
:: sq. AC : the figure (i. 21).

But

rect. AF, FC : sq. FB comp. AF : FB, FC : FB;

therefore

figure : sq. AC comp. FB : AF, FB : FC.

But

AF : FB :: AC : CE,

and

FC : FB :: AC : AD;

therefore

figure : sq. AC comp. CE : AC, AD : AC.

And also

rect. AD, CE : sq. AC comp. CE : AC, AD : AC;

therefore

figure : sq. AC :: rect. AD, CE : sq. AC.

rect. AD, CE = figure on AC.

## Proposition 54

If two tangents to a section of a cone or to a circumference of a circle meet, and through the points of contact parallels to the tangents are drawn, and from the points of contact to the same point of the line of the section, straight lines are drawn across cutting the parallels, then the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off to the square on the straight line joining the points of contact has a ratio compounded of the ratio which the inside segment line joining the point of meeting of the tangents and the midpoint of the straight line joining the points of contact has in square to the remainder, and of the ratio which the rectangle contained by the tangents has to the fourth part of the square on the straight line joining the points of contact.

Let there be a section of a cone or circumference of a circle ABC and tangents AD and CD, and let AC be joined and bisected at E, and let DBE be joined, and let AF be drawn from A parallel to CD, and CG from C parallel to AD, and let some point H on the section be taken, and let the straight lines AH and CH be joined and produced to G and F.

I say that

rect. AF, CG : sq. AC comp. sq. EB : sq. BD, rect. AD, DC : fourth sq. AC or rect. AE, EC.

For let KHOXL be drawn from H parallel to AC, and from B, MBN parallel to AC; then it is evident that MN is tangent (ii. 29, 5, 6). Since then

AE = EC,

also

MB = BN,

and

KO = OL,

and

HO = OX (ii. 7)

and

KH = XL.

Since then MB and MA are tangents and KHL has been drawn parallel to MB,

sq. AM : sq. MB :: sq. AK : rect. XK, KH (iii. 16)
or
sq. AM : rect. MB, BN :: sq. AK : rect. LH, HK.

And

rect. NC, AM : sq. AM :: rect. LC, AK : sq. AK (Eucl. vi. 2; v, 18);
therefore ex aequali
rect. NC, AM : rect. MB, BN :: rect. LC, AK : rect. LH, HK.

But

rect. LC, AK : rect. LH, HK comp. LC : LH, AK : HK
or
rect. LC, AK : rect. LH, HK comp. FA : AC, GC : CA
which is the same as
rect. GC, FA : sq. CA.

Therefore

rect. NC, AM : rect. MB, BN :: rect. GC, FA : sq. CA.

But, with the rectangle ND, DM taken as a mean,

rect. NC, AM : rect. MB, BN comp.
rect. NC, AM : rect. ND, DM, rect. ND, DM : rect. MB, BN;

therefore

rect. GC, FA : sq. CA comp.
rect. NC, AM : rect. ND, DM, rect. ND, DM : rect. MB, BN.

But

rect. NC, AM : rect. ND, DM :: sq. EB : sq. BD,

and

rect. ND, DM : rect. NB, BM :: rect. CD, DA : rect. CE, EA;
therefore

rect. GC, FA : sq. CA comp. sq. BE : sq. BD, rect. CD, DA : rect. CE, EA.

## Proposition 55

If two straight lines touching opposite sections meet, and through the point of meeting a straight line is drawn parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, and, from the points of contact parallels to the tangents are drawn across, and straight lines are produced from the points of contact to the same point of one of the sections cutting the parallels, then the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off will have to the square on the straight line joining the points of contact the ratio which the rectangle contained by the tangents has to the square on the straight line drawn through the point of meeting parallel to the straight line joining the points of contact, as far as the section.

Let there be the opposite sections ABC and DEF, and tangents to them AG and GD, and let AD be joined, and from G let CGE be drawn parallel to AD, and from A, AM parallel to DG, and from D, DM parallel to AG, and let some point F be taken on the section DF, and let ANF and FDH be joined.

I say that

sq. CG : rect. AG, GD :: sq. AD : rect. HA, DN.

For let FLKB be drawn through F parallel to AD.

Since then it has been shown that

sq. EG : sq. GD :: rect. BL, LF : sq. DL (iii. 20),

and

CG = EG (ii. 38),

and

BK = LF (ii. 38),

therefore

sq. CG : sq. GD :: rect. KF, FL : sq. DL.

And also

sq. GD : rect. AG, GD :: sq. DL : rect. DL, AK (Eucl. vi. 2, 1);
therefore ex aequali

sq. GC : rect. AG, GD :: rect. KF, FL : rect. DL, AK.

But

rect. KF, FL : rect. DL, AK comp. KF : AK, FL : DL.

But

KF : AK :: AD : DN,

and

FL : DL :: AD : HA;

therefore

sq. CG : rect. AG, GD comp. AD : DN, AD : HA.

And also

sq. AD : rect. HA, DN comp. AD : DN, AD : HA;

therefore

sq. CG : rect. AG, GD :: sq. AD : rect. HA, DN.

## Proposition 56

If two straight lines touching one of the opposite sections meet, and parallels to the tangents are drawn through the points of contact, and straight lines cutting the parallels are drawn from the points of contact to the same point of the other section, then the rectangle contained by the straight lines cut off will have to the square on the straight line joining the points of contact the ratio compounded of the ratio which, of the straight line joining the point of meeting and the midpoint, that part between the midpoint and the other section has in square to that part between the same section and the point of meeting, and of the ratio which the rectangle contained by the tangents has to the fourth part of the square on the straight line joining the points of contact.

Let there be the opposite sections AB and CD whose center is O, and tangents AEFG and BEHK, and let AB be joined, and bisected at L, and let LE be joined and drawn across to D, and let AM be drawn from A parallel to BE, and BN from B parallel to AE, and let some point C be taken on the section CD, and let CBM and CAN be joined.

I say that

rect. MA, BN : sq. AB comp. sq. LD : sq. DE, rect. AE, EB : fourth sq. AB or rect. AL, LB.

For let GCK and HDF be drawn from C and D parallel to AL; then it is evident that

HD = DF,

and

KX = XG,

and also

XC = XP;

and so also

CK = GP.

And since AB and DC are opposite sections, and BEH and HD are tangents and KG is parallel to DH, therefore

sq. BH : sq. HD :: sq. BK : rect. PK, KC (iii. 18, note).

But

sq. HD = rect. HD, DF,
rect. PK, KC = rect. BC, CG.

Therefore

sq. BH : rect. HD, DF :: sq. BK : rect. KC, CG.

And also

rect. FA, BH : sq. BH :: rect. GA, BK : sq. BK;
therefore ex aequali

rect. FA, BH : rect. HD, DF :: rect. GA, BK : rect. KC, CG.
And, with rectangle HE, EF taken as a mean,

rect. FA, HB : rect. HD, DF comp.
rect. FA, HB : rect. HE, EF, rect. HE, EF : rect. HD, DF;

and

rect. FA, HB : rect. HE, EF :: sq. LD : sq. DE,

and

rect. HE, EF : rect. HD, DF :: rect. AE, EB : rect. AL, LB;
therefore

rect. GA, BK : rect. KC, CG comp. sq. LD : sq. DE, rect. AE, EB :
rect. AL, LB.

And

rect. GA, BK : rect. KC, CG comp. BK : KC, GA : CG.

But

BK : KC :: MA : AB,

and

GA : CG :: BN : AB;

therefore

rect. MA, BN : sq. AB comp. MA : AB, BN : AB
comp. sq. LD : sq. DE, rect. AE, EB : rect. AL, LB.

## Translator’s Appendix on Three- and Four-Line Loci

The three-line locus property of conics is easily deduced for the ellipse, hyperbola, parabola and circle from iii. 54; and for the opposite sections from iii. 55 and 56. The three-line locus property of conics can be stated thus. Any conic section or circle or pair of opposite sections can be considered as the locus of points whose distances from three given fixed straight lines (the distances being either perpendicular or at a given constant angle to each of the given straight lines, although the constant angle may be different for each of the three straight lines) are such that the square of one of the distances is always in a constant ratio to the rectangle contained by the other two distances.

It is shown in iii. 54 that in the case of conic sections and circles rect. AF, CG : sq. AC comp. sq. EB : sq. BD, rect. AD, DC : fourth sq. AC.
Now if we consider the straight lines AD, DC, and AC as fixed and given and therefore straight line DE fixed and given as bisecting AC, then it is evident that the straight lines AC, EB, BD, AD, DC, and therefore the squares on them and the rectangles contained by them, are also fixed and given. Then although as the point H is taken at different points along the conic, the straight lines AF and CG change in magnitude, nevertheless the magnitude of the rectangle AF, CG, because of the above proportion remains constant.

For let EX be drawn parallel to BE, and HY to AD, and HZ to DC. Then HX is the distance from H to AC at a given angle, and AY because of parallels represents the distance from H to AD at another given angle, and ZC represents the distance from H to DC at another given angle. Then by similar triangles

CZ : ZH :: AC : AF,
AY : YH :: AC : CG;
therefore compounding
rect. CZ, AY : rect. ZH, YH :: sq. AC : rect. AF, CG.

Now we have seen that the rectangle AF, CG is a constant magnitude as the point H changes, and the square on AC is constant; therefore their ratio is constant. Therefore

rect. CZ, AY : rect. ZH, YH is a constant ratio. (1)

Again by similar triangles

ZH : HX :: CD : DE,
YH : HX :: AD : DE;
therefore compounding
rect. ZH, YH : sq. HX :: rect. CD, AD : sq. DE.

But rectangle CD, AD and the square on DE are constant magnitudes as the point H changes; therefore their ratio is constant. Therefore

rect. ZH, YH : sq. HX is a constant ratio (2)

Compounding (1) and (2), we get a constant ratio, that is

rect. CZ, AY : sq. HX is a constant ratio.

In other words, as the point H changes, the rectangle contained by the distances from H to two of the given straight lines (at given angles to those straight lines) has a constant ratio to the square on the distance to the third straight line (at a given angle to that straight line). And it can easily be proved by means of similar triangles that if any other three angles are chosen for the distances, than those chosen here for the demonstration, then the corresponding ratio will be constant, although not equal.

The four-line locus property can be easily deduced from the three-line. If to any conic section we construct four tangents AG, BE, AI, and EC, and the straight lines FG, GI, ID, and DF, joining the points of contact; and draw the distances from any point H on the conic to these straight lines at any given angles (perpendiculars are convenient), then by the three-line locus property with respect to triangle FBG for any point H on the conic

rect. HX, HV : sq. HP is constant; (α)

with respect to triangle AIG

rect. HX, HY : sq. HR is constant; (β)

with respect to triangle DCI

rect. HY, HZ : sq. HS is constant; (γ)

with respect to triangle EFD

rect. HZ, HY : sq. HQ is constant (δ)

It will be noticed that we have taken in succession a pair of adjacent tangents and the straight line joining their points of contact. It will also be noticed that the rectangles in the four ratios present a cyclical arrangement, so that if the inverse of (α) is compounded with (β), and the inverse of (γ) with (δ), we would have two constant ratios

pllpd. HY, HP, HP : pllpd. HV, HR, HR, (ε)
pllpd. HV, HS, HS : pllpd. HY, HQ, HQ (ζ)

Again compounding the first of these with the second, we would have finally

rect. HP, HS : rect. HQ, HR, a constant ratio.

And this is the property of the four-line locus, namely the locus of points H such that the rectangle contained by the distances from points H to any two given fixed straight lines FG and ID has to the rectangle contained by the distances from H to two other fixed straight lines, IG, FD, a constant ratio.

The rigorous method of effecting these compoundings is as follows. For inverting (α), by Eucl. xi, 32 we have the constant ratios

sq. HP : rect. HX, HV :: pllpd. HP, HP, HY : pllpd. HX, HV, HY,
rect. HX, HY : sq. HR :: pllpd. HX, HY, HY : pllpd. HR, HR, HY.
Hence, by definition, the ratio (a constant one) compounded of these two is

pllpd. HY, HP, HP : pllpd. HV, HR, HR.

And in the same way we find the constant ratio compounded of the inverse of (γ) and (δ). Now

pllpd. HY, HP, HP : pllpd. HV, HR, HR comp. HY : HV, sq. HP : sq. HR.
pllpd. HV, HS, HS : pllpd. HY, HQ, HQ comp. HV : HY, sq. HS : sq. HQ.
If then we take two lines M and X such that

HP : HR :: HR : M, (η)
HS : HQ :: HQ : X, (θ)

then

sq. HP : sq. HR :: HP : M,
sq. HS : sq. HQ :: HS : X.

Hence
ratio comp. HY : HV, sq. HP : sq. HR is ratio comp. HY : HV, HP : M.
And ratio comp. HV : HY, sq. HS : sq. HQ is ratio comp. HV : HY, HS : X.

But

rect. HY, HP : rect. HV, M comp. HY : HV, HP : M.
rect. HV, HS : rect. HY, X comp. HV : HY, HS : X;

and

pllpd. HY, HP, HS : pllpd. HV, M, HS :: rect. HY, HP : rect. HV, M,
pllpd. HV, HS, M : pllpd. HY, X, M :: rect. HV, HS : rect. HY, X;

and these are constant ratios. Hence compounding, we get the constant ratio

pllpd. HY, HP, HS : pllpd. HY, X, M,
which is the same as the constant ratio

rect. HP, HS : rect. X, M.

Now, taking L and O as some constants,

rect. HP, HS : rect. X, M :: L : O

and

rect. HP, HS : rect. HR, HQ :: rect. HR, HQ : rect. M, X
by compounding (η) and (θ). But equal ratios have equal duplicate ratios (Heath’s note to Euclid, vi, 22) and hence

rect. HP, HS : rect. HR, HQ is constant.

In the case of opposite sections, it is shown in iii. 56 rect. MA, BN : sq. AB comp. sq. LD : sq. DE, rect. AE, EB : fourth sq. AB.
Then it is evident for the same reasons as before that for different points C the magnitudes MA and BN may change, but the rectangle MA, BN is a constant magnitude.

For as before, let CX be drawn parallel to DE, CY to EA, CZ to EB. By similar triangles

AY : YC :: AB : BN,
BZ : ZC :: AB : MA;
therefore compounding
rect. AY, BZ : rect. YC, ZC :: sq. AB : rect. MA, BN.

Since rectangle MA, BN is constant as C changes, and also the square on AB is constant, therefore

rect. AY, BZ : rect. YC, ZC is a constant ratio (1)

Again by similar triangles

ZC : CX :: EB : EL,

Hence

rect. YC, ZC : sq. CX :: rect. EB, EA : sq. EL.

rect. YC, ZC : sq. CX is a constant ratio (2)

Compounding (1) and (2) we have a constant ratio

rect. AY, BZ : sq. CX.

But AY and BZ are equal to CA' and CB', the distances from C. This is the property of the three-line locus of section C with respect to the straight lines EA and EB tangents to the other section, and AB the straight line joining their points of contact. And so one opposite section is a three-line locus to the tangents to the other of the opposite sections. That it is also a four-line locus could be shown in the same way as before.

Again from iii. 55 we can conclude that both of the opposite sections together are a three-line locus to the triangle formed by a tangent to each of the sections and the straight line joining their points of contact. For by iii. 55 rect. HA, DN : sq. AD :: rect. AG, GD : sq. CG.

Now since the three last terms of this proportion are evidently constants as the point F changes, therefore also, although HA and DN change with F, yet rectangle HA, DN remains constant in magnitude. Then reproducing the figure of iii. 55, we drop YF parallel to DL, and FZ to KA, and FX to GE, where E is the midpoint of AD. Then by similar triangles

YD : FY :: AD : HA,
AZ : FZ :: AD : DN;
therefore compounding
rect. FD, AZ : rect. FY, FZ :: sq. AD : rect. HA, DN.

But the last two terms are constant, therefore

rect. YD, AZ : rect. FY, FZ is a constant ratio (1)

Again by similar triangles

FY : FX :: DG : EG,
FZ : FX :: AG : EG;
therefore compounding
rect. FY, FZ : sq. FX :: rect. DG, AG : rect. ED, EG,

But the last two terms are constant, therefore

rect. FY, FZ : sq. FX is a constant ratio (2)

Compounding (1) and (2), we see that

rect. YD, AZ : sq. FX is a constant ratio.

But this is the definition of a three-line locus that the rectangle contained by the distances from any point on the locus to two fixed straight lines has to the square on the distance to a third fixed straight line a constant ratio. But DY = LF, AZ = KF, and FX is the distance from F to AD. And so the ratio fulfills the definition.

Furthermore, if we consider B the point of intersection of the straight line KF, drawn parallel to AD, with the other opposite section, and draw BS parallel to FY, BR to FX, and BT to FZ, since they are parallels between parallels,

BR = FX,
KF = AZ,
TA = BK.

But it was shown in the course of iii. 55 that

BK = LF,
BL = KF.

Hence

TA = BK = YD = LF,
AZ = KF = BL.

Therefore

rect. LF, KF : sq. FX :: rect. BK, BL : sq. BR.

Hence any point B on one opposite section fulfills the same constant ratio with respect to its distances from the three fixed lines AD, GD, and AG as any point F on the other opposite section.

It can be similarly deduced that the opposite sections are together a four-line locus with respect to any four fixed straight lines joining points, two on each section (the points being four points of contact of four tangents, and the straight lines, the straight lines joining them).

To sum up, a parabola, ellipse, circle, and hyperbola are three-line loci with respect to any two tangents to them and a straight line joining the points of contact. One opposite section is also a three-line locus with respect to any two tangents to the other section together with the straight line joining their points of contact. The two opposite sections together are a three-line locus with respect to two tangents, each to one of the sections, together with the straight line joining their points of contact.

The parabola, ellipse, circle, and hyperbola are four-line loci with respect to any inscribed quadrilateral. One opposite section is also a four-line locus with respect to any quadrilateral inscribed in the other section. The two opposite sections together are a four-line locus to any four straight lines joining four points, two lying on each opposite section.
