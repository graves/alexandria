### Works in This Volume

- **Advancement of Learning** - A survey and defense of all branches of human knowledge, arguing for the dignity of learning and proposing a comprehensive reform of the sciences. Bacon classifies the sciences according to the faculties of the mind: memory (history), imagination (poetry), and reason (philosophy).

- **Novum Organum** (The New Organon) - Bacon's masterwork on scientific method, intended to replace Aristotle's Organon. He identifies the "idols" (false notions) that obstruct understanding and proposes a new method of induction based on systematic observation and experiment to unlock nature's secrets.

- **New Atlantis** - An unfinished utopian fable describing the island of Bensalem and its research institution, Solomon's House. A prophetic vision of organized scientific research dedicated to improving human life.
