## RENE DESCARTES (1596-1650)

## BARUCH SPINOZA (1632-1677)

Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese-Jewish origin, one of the great rationalists of the seventeenth century. Excommunicated from the Jewish community for his radical views, he lived modestly as a lens grinder while developing one of the most rigorous philosophical systems ever constructed.
