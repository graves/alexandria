Problems the Construction of Which Requires Only Straight Lines and Circles

Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a knowledge of the lengths of certain straight lines is sufficient for its construction. Just as arithmetic consists of only four or five operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the extraction of roots, which may be considered a kind of division, so in geometry, to find required lines it is merely necessary to add or subtract other lines; or else, taking one line which I shall call unity in order to relate it as closely as possible to numbers, and which can in general be chosen arbitrarily, and having given two other lines, to find a fourth line which shall be to one of the given lines as the other is to unity (which is the same as multiplication); or, again, to find a fourth line which is to one of the given lines as unity is to the other (which is equivalent to division); or, finally, to find one, two, or several mean proportionals between unity and some other line (which is the same as extracting the square root, cube root, etc., of the given line). And I shall not hesitate to introduce these arithmetical terms into geometry, for the sake of greater clearness.

For example, let AB be taken as unity, and let it be required to multiply BD by BC. I have only to join the points A and C, and draw DE parallel to CA; then BE is the product of BD and BC.

*Fig. 1* *Fig. 2*

If it be required to divide BE by BD, I join E and D, and draw AC parallel to DE; then BC is the result of the division.

If the square root of GH is desired, I add, along the same straight line, FG equal to unity; then, bisecting FH at K, I describe the circle FIH about K as a center, and draw from G a perpendicular and extend it to I, and GI is the required root. I do not speak here of cube root, or other roots, since I shall speak more conveniently of them later.

Often it is not necessary thus to draw the lines on paper, but it is sufficient to designate each by a single letter. Thus, to add the lines BD and GH, I call one *a* and the other *b*, and write *a+b*. Then *a - b* will indicate that *b* is subtracted from *a*; *ab* that *a* is multiplied by *b*; *a/b* that *a* is divided by *b*; *a^2* or *a^2* that *a* is multiplied by itself; *a^3* that this result is multiplied by *a*, and so on, indefinitely. Again, if I wish to extract the square root of *a^2+b^2*, I write `sqrt(a^2+b^2)`; if I wish to extract the cube root of *a^3 - b^3 + ab^2*, I write `sqrt[3](a^3 - b^3 + ab^2)`; and similarly for other roots. Here it must be observed that by *a^2*, *b^2*, and similar expressions, I ordinarily mean only simple lines, which, however, I name squares, cubes, etc., so that I may make use of the terms employed in algebra.

It should also be noted that all parts of a single line should always be expressed by the same number of dimensions, provided unity is not determined by the conditions of the problem. Thus, `sqrt(a^2+b^2)` contains as many dimensions as *ab* or *b^2*, these being the component parts of the line which I have called `sqrt(a^3 - b^3 + ab^2)`. It is not, however, the same thing when unity is determined, because unity can always be understood, even where there are too many or too few dimensions: thus, if it be required to extract the cube root of *a^2b^2 - b*, we must consider the quantity *a^2b^2* divided once by unity, and the quantity *b* multiplied twice by unity.

Finally, so that we may be sure to remember the names of these lines, a separate list should always be made as often as names are assigned or changed. For example, we may write, AB = 1, that is AB is equal to 1; GH = *a*, BD = *b*, and so on.

If, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution already effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful for its construction,— to those that are unknown as well as to those that are known. Then, making no distinction between known and unknown lines, we must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows most naturally the relations between these lines, until we find it possible to express a single quantity in two ways. This will constitute an equation, since the terms of one of these two expressions are together equal to the terms of the other.

We must find as many such equations as there are supposed to be unknown lines; but if, after considering everything involved, so many cannot be found, it is evident that the question is not entirely determined. In such a case we may choose arbitrarily lines of known length for each unknown line to which there corresponds no equation.

If there are several equations, we must use each in order, either considering it alone or comparing it with the others, so as to obtain a value for each of the unknown lines; and so we must combine them until there remains a single unknown line which is equal to some known line, or whose square, cube, fourth power, fifth power, sixth power, etc., is equal to the sum or difference of two or more quantities, one of which is known, while the others consist of mean proportionals between unity and this square, or cube, or fourth power, etc., multiplied by other known lines. I may express this as follows:

*z = b*
or *z^2 = -az + b^2*
or *z^3 = az^2 + b^2z - c^3*
or *z^4 = az^3 - b^2z + etc.*

That is, *z*, which I take for the unknown quantity, is equal to *b*; or, the square of *z* is equal to the square of *b* diminished by *a* multiplied by *z*; or, the cube of *z* is equal to *a* multiplied by the square of *z*, plus the square of *b* multiplied by *z*, diminished by the cube of *c*; and similarly for the others.

Thus, all the unknown quantities can be expressed in terms of a single quantity, whenever the problem can be constructed by means of circles and straight lines, or by conic sections, or even by some other curve of degree not greater than the third or fourth.

But I shall not stop to explain this in more detail, because I should deprive you of the pleasure of mastering it yourself, as well as of the advantage of training your mind by working over it, which is in my opinion the principal benefit to be derived from this science. Because, I find nothing here so difficult that it cannot be worked out by any one at all familiar with ordinary geometry and with algebra, who will consider carefully all that is set forth in this treatise.

![Fig. 3](https://i.imgur.com/example3.png)
I will therefore content myself with the statement that if the student, in solving these equations, does not fail to make use of division wherever possible, he will surely reach the simplest terms to which the problem can be reduced.

And if it can be solved by ordinary geometry, that is, by the use of straight lines and circles on a plane surface, when the last equation shall have been entirely solved there will remain at most only the square of an unknown quantity, equal to the product of its root by some known quantity, increased or diminished by some other quantity also known. Then this root or unknown line can easily be found. For example, if I have *z^2 = az + b^2*, I construct a right triangle NLM with one side LM, equal to *b*, the square root of the known quantity *b^2*, and the other side, LN, equal to *a/2*, that is, to half the other known quantity which was multiplied by *z*, which I supposed to be the unknown line. Then prolonging MN, the hypotenuse of this triangle, to O, so that NO is equal to NL, the whole line OM is the required line *z*. This is expressed in the following way:

*z = a/2 + sqrt(a^2/4 + b^2)*.

But if I have *y^2 = -ay + b^2*, where *y* is the quantity whose value is desired, I construct the same right triangle NLM, and on the hypotenuse MN lay off NP equal to NL, and the remainder PM is *y*, the desired root. Thus I have

*y = a/2 + sqrt(a^2/4 + b^2)*.

In the same way, if I had

*x^2 = ax - b^2*,

PM would be *x*, and I should have
*x = a/2 + sqrt(a^2/4 - b^2)*,
and so for other cases.

Finally, if I have *z^2 = -az + b^2*, I make NL equal to *a/2*, and LM equal to *b* as before; then, instead of joining the points M and N, I draw MQR parallel to LN, and with N as a center describe a circle through L cutting MQR in the points Q and R; then *z*, the line sought, is either MQ or MR, for in this case it can be expressed in two ways, namely:

*z = a/2 + sqrt(a^2/4 - b^2)*,
and
*z = a/2 - sqrt(a^2/4 - b^2)*.

![Fig. 4](https://i.imgur.com/example4.png)
And if the circle described about N and passing through L neither cuts nor touches the line MQR, the equation has no root, so that we may say that the construction of the problem is impossible.

These same roots can be found by many other methods; I have given these very simple ones to show that it is possible to construct all the problems of ordinary geometry by doing no more than the little covered in the four figures that I have explained. This is one thing which I believe the ancient mathematicians did not observe, for otherwise they would not have put so much labor into writing so many books in which the very sequence of the propositions shows that they did not have a sure method of finding all, but rather gathered together those propositions on which they had happened by accident.

This is also evident from what *Pappus* has done in the beginning of his *Seventh Book*, where, after devoting considerable space to an enumeration of the books on geometry written by his predecessors, he finally refers to a question which he says that neither *Euclid* nor *Apollonius* nor any one else had been able to solve completely; and these are his words:

> *Quem autem dicit (Apollonius) in tertio libro locum ad tres, et quatuor lineas ab Euclide perfectum non esse, neque ipse perficere poterat, neque aliquis alius; sed neque paululum quid addere iis, quae Euclides scripsit, per ea tantum conica, quae usque ad Euclidis tempora praemonstrata sunt, etc.*
>
> ^Moreover, he (Apollonius) says that the problem of the locus related to three or four lines was not entirely solved by Euclid, and that neither he himself, nor any one else has been able to solve it completely, nor were they able to add anything at all to those things which Euclid had written, by means of the conic sections only which had been demonstrated before Euclid.

A little farther on, he states the question as follows:

> *At locus ad tres, et quatuor lineas, in quo (Apollonius) magnifice sejactat, et ostentat, nulla habita gratia ei, qui prius scripserat, est hujusmodi. Si positione datis tribus rectis lineis ab uno et eodem puncto, ad tres lineas in datis angulis rectae lineae ducantur, et data sit proportio rectanguli contenti duabus ductis ad quadratum reliquae: punctum contingit positione datum solidum locum, hoc est unam ex tribus conicis sectionibus. Et si ad quatuor rectas lineas positione datas in datis angulis lineae ducantur: et rectanguli duabus ductis contenti ad contentum duabus reliqiiis proportio data sit; similiter punctum datum coni sectionem positione continget. Si quidem igitur ad duas tantum locus planus ostensus est. Quod si ad plures quam quatuor, punctum continget locos non adhuc cognitos, sed lineas tantum dictas; quoties autem sint, vel quam habeant proprietatem, non constat: earum unam, neque primam, et quae manifestissima videtur, composuerunt ostendentes utilem esse. Propositiones autem ipsarum hoc sunt.*
>
> *Si ab aliquo puncto ad positione datas rectas lineas quinque ducantur rectae lineae in datis angulis, et data sit proportio solidi parallelepipedi rectanguli, quod tribus ductis lineis continetur ad solidum parallelepipedum rectangulum, quod continetur reliqiiis duabus, et data quapiam linea, punctum positione datam lineam continget. Si autem ad sex, et data sit proportio solidi tribus lineis contenti ad solidum, quod tribus reliqiiis continetur; rursus punctum continget positione datam lineam. Quod si ad plures quam sex, non adhuc habent dicere, an data sit proportio cujuspiam contenti quatuor lineis ad id quod reliqiiis continetur, quoniam non est aliquid contentum pluribus quam tribus dimensionibus.*
>
> ^The problem of the locus related to three or four lines, about which he (Apollonius) boasts so proudly, giving no credit to the writer who had preceded him, is of this nature: If three straight lines are given in position, and if straight lines be drawn from one and the same point, making given angles with the three given lines; and if there be given the ratio of the rectangle contained by two of the lines so drawn to the square of the other, the point lies on a solid locus given in position, namely, one of the three conic sections.
>
> Again, if lines be drawn making given angles with four straight lines given in position, and if the rectangle of two of the lines so drawn bears a given ratio to the rectangle of the other two; then, in like manner, the point lies on a conic section given in position. It has been shown that to only two lines there corresponds a plane locus. But if there be given more than four lines, the point generates loci not known up to the present time, but merely called ‘lines.’ It is not clear what they are, or what their properties. One of them, not the first but the most manifest, has been examined, and this has proved to be helpful. These, however, are the propositions concerning them.
>
> If from any point straight lines be drawn making given angles with five straight lines given in position, and if the solid rectangular parallelepiped contained by three of the lines so drawn bears a given ratio to the solid rectangular parallelepiped contained by the other two and any given line whatever, the point lies on a ‘line’ given in position. Again, if there be six lines, and if the solid contained by three of the lines bears a given ratio to the solid contained by the other three lines, the point also lies on a ‘line’ given in position. But if there be more than six lines, we cannot say whether a ratio of something contained by four lines is given to that which is contained by the rest, since there is no figure of more than three dimensions.

Here I beg you to observe in passing that the considerations that forced ancient writers to use arithmetical terms in geometry, thus making it impossible for them to proceed beyond a point where they could see clearly the relation between the two subjects, caused much obscurity and embarrassment, in their attempts at explanation.

*Pappus* proceeds as follows:

> *Acquiescunt autem his, qui paulo ante talia interpretati sunt; neque unum aliquo pacto comprehensibile significantes quod his continetur. Licebit autem per conjunctas proportiones haec, et dicere et demonstrare universe in dictis proportionibus, atque his in hunc modum. Si ab aliquo puncto ad positione datas rectas lineas ducantur rectae lineae in datis angulis, et data sit proportio conjuncta ex ea, quam habet una ductarum ad unam, et altera ad alteram, et alia ad aliam, et reliqua ad datam lineam, si sint septem; si vero octo, et reliqua ad reliquam: punctum continget positione datas lineas. Et similiter quotcumque sint impares vel pares multitudine, cum hoc, ut dixi, loco ad quatuor lineas respondeant, nullum igitur posuerunt ita ut linea nota sit, etc.*
>
> ^For in this are agreed those who formerly interpreted these things (that the dimensions of a figure cannot exceed three) in that they maintain that a figure that is contained by these lines is not comprehensible in any way. This is permissible, however, both to say and to demonstrate generally by this kind of proportion, and in this manner: If from any point straight lines be drawn making given angles with straight lines given in position; and if there be given a ratio compounded of them, that is the ratio that one of the lines drawn has to one, the second has to a second, the third to a third, and so on to the given line if there be seven lines, or, if there be eight lines, of the last to a last, the point lies on the lines that are given in position. And similarly, whatever may be the odd or even number, since these, as I have said, correspond in position to the four lines; therefore they have not set forth any method so that a line may be known.

The question, then, the solution of which was begun by *Euclid* and carried farther by *Apollonius*, but was completed by no one, is this:

Having three, four or more lines given in position, it is first required to find a point from which as many other lines may be drawn, each making a given angle with one of the given lines, so that the rectangle of two of the lines so drawn shall bear a given ratio to the square of the third (if there be only three); or to the rectangle of the other two (if there be four), or again, that the parallelepiped constructed upon three shall bear a given ratio to that upon the other two and any given line (if there be five), or to the parallelepiped upon the other three (if there be six); or (if there be seven) that the product obtained by multiplying four of them together shall bear a given ratio to the product of the other three, or (if there be eight) that the product of four of them shall bear a given ratio to the product of the other four. Thus the question admits of extension to any number of lines.

Then, since there is always an infinite number of different points satisfying these requirements, it is also required to discover and trace the curve containing all such points. *Pappus* says that when there are only three or four lines given, this line is one of the three conic sections, but he does not undertake to determine, describe, or explain the nature of the line required when the question involves a greater number of lines. He only adds that the ancients recognized one of them which they had shown to be useful, and which seemed the simplest, and yet was not the most important. This led me to try to find out whether, by my own method, I could go as far as they had gone.

First, I discovered that if the question be proposed for only three, four, or five lines, the required points can be found by elementary geometry, that is, by the use of the ruler and compasses only, and the application of those principles that I have already explained, except in the case of five parallel lines. In this case, and in the cases where there are six, seven, eight, or nine given lines, the required points can always be found by means of the geometry of solid loci, that is, by using some one of the three conic sections. Here, again, there is an exception in the case of nine parallel lines. For this and the cases of ten, eleven, twelve, or thirteen given lines, the required points may be found by means of a curve of degree next higher than that of the conic sections. Again, the case of thirteen parallel lines must be excluded, for which, as well as for the cases of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen lines, a curve of degree next higher than the preceding must be used; and so on indefinitely.

Next, I have found that when only three or four lines are given, the required points lie not only all on one of the conic sections but sometimes on the circumference of a circle, or even on a straight line.

When there are five, six, seven, or eight lines, the required points lie on a curve of degree next higher than the conic sections, and it is impossible to imagine such a curve that may not satisfy the conditions of the problem; but the required points may possibly lie on a conic section, a circle, or a straight line. If there are nine, ten, eleven, or twelve lines, the required curve is only one degree higher than the preceding, but any such curve may meet the requirements, and so on to infinity.

Finally, the first and simplest curve after the conic sections is the one generated by the intersection of a parabola with a straight line in a way to be described presently.

I believe that I have in this way completely accomplished what *Pappus* tells us the ancients sought to do, and I will try to give the demonstration in a few words, for I am already wearied by so much writing.

Let AB, AD, EF, GH, • • • be any number of straight lines given in position, and let it be required to find a point C, from which straight lines CB, CD, CF, CH, • • • can be drawn, making given angles CBA, CDA, CFE, CHG, • • • respectively, with the given lines, and such that the product of certain of them is equal to the product of the rest, or at least such that these two products shall have a given ratio, for this condition does not make the problem any more difficult.

First, I suppose the thing done, and since so many lines are confusing, I may simplify matters by considering one of the given lines and one of those to be drawn (as, for example, AB and BC) as the principal lines, to which I shall try to refer all the others. Call the segment of the line AB between A and B, *x*, and call BC, *y*. Produce all the other given lines to meet these two (also produced if necessary) provided none is parallel to either of the principal lines. Thus, in the figure, the given lines cut AB in the points A, E, G, and cut BC in the points R, S, T.

Now, since all the angles of the triangle ARB are known, the ratio between the sides AB and BR is known. If we let AB:BR = *z:b*, since AB = *x*, we have RB = *bx/z*; and since B lies between C and R, we have CR = *y + bx/z*. (When R lies between C and B, CR is equal to *y - bx/z*, and when C lies between B and R, CR is equal to *-y + bx/z*.) Again, the three angles of the triangle DRC are known, and therefore the ratio between the sides CR and CD is determined. Calling this ratio *z:c*, since CR = *y + bx/z*, we have CD = *cy/z + bcx/z^2*. Then, since the lines AB, AD, and EF are given in position, the distance from A to E is known. If we call this distance *k*, then EB = *k+x*; although EB = *k - x* when B lies between E and A, and EB = *-k + x* when E lies between A and B. Now the angles of the triangle ESB being given, the ratio of BE to BS is known. We may call this ratio *z:d*. Then BS = *d(k+x)/z*; and CS = *y - d(k+x)/z*. When S lies between B and C we have CS = *y - d(k+x)/z*, and when C lies between B and S we have CS = *-y + d(k+x)/z*. The angles of the triangle FSC are known, and hence, also the ratio of CS to CF, or *z:e*. Therefore, CF = *ey/z - ed(k+x)/z^2*. Likewise, AG or *l* is given, and BG = *l - x*. Also, in triangle BGT, the ratio of BG to BT, or *z:f*, is known. Therefore, BT = *f(l-x)/z*, and CT = *y + f(l-x)/z*. In triangle TCH, the ratio of TC to CH, or *z:g*, is known, whence CH = *gy/z + gf(l-x)/z^2*.

And thus you see that, no matter how many lines are given in position, the length of any such line through C making given angles with these lines can always be expressed by three terms, one of which consists of the unknown quantity *y* multiplied or divided by some known quantity; another consisting of the unknown quantity *x* multiplied or divided by some other known quantity; and the third consisting of a known quantity. An exception must be made in the case where the given lines are parallel either to AB (when the term containing *x* vanishes), or to CB (when the term containing *y* vanishes). This case is too simple to require further explanation. The signs of the terms may be either + or - in every conceivable combination.

You also see that in the product of any number of these lines the degree of any term containing *x* or *y* will not be greater than the number of lines (expressed by means of *x* and *y*) whose product is found. Thus, no term will be of degree higher than the second if two lines be multiplied together, nor of degree higher than the third, if there be three lines, and so on to infinity.

Furthermore, to determine the point C, but one condition is needed, namely, that the product of a certain number of lines shall be equal to, or (what is quite as simple), shall bear a given ratio to the product of certain other lines. Since this condition can be expressed by a single equation in two unknown quantities, we may give any value we please to either *x* or *y* and find the value of the other from this equation. It is obvious that when not more than five lines are given, the quantity *x*, which is not used to express the first of the lines, can never be of degree higher than the second.

Assigning a value to *y*, we have *x^2 = ±ax ± b^2*, and therefore *x* can be found with ruler and compasses, by a method already explained. If then we should take successively an infinite number of different values for the line *y*, we should obtain an infinite number of values for the line *x*, and therefore an infinity of different points, such as C, by means of which the required curve could be drawn.

This method can be used when the problem concerns six or more lines, if some of them are parallel to either AB or BC, in which case either *x* or *y* will be of only the second degree in the equation, so that the point C can be found with ruler and compasses.

On the other hand, if the given lines are all parallel even though a question should be proposed involving only five lines, the point C cannot be found in this way. For, since the quantity *x* does not occur at all in the equation, it is no longer allowable to give a known value to *y*. It is then necessary to find the value of *y*. And since the term in *y* will now be of the third degree, its value can be found only by finding the root of a cubic equation, which cannot in general be done without the use of one of the conic sections.

And furthermore, if not more than nine lines are given, not all of them being parallel, the equation can always be so expressed as to be of degree not higher than the fourth. Such equations can always be solved by means of the conic sections in a way that I shall presently explain.

Again, if there are not more than thirteen lines, an equation of degree not higher than the sixth can be employed, which admits of solution by means of a curve just one degree higher than the conic sections by a method to be explained presently.

This completes the first part of what I have to demonstrate here, but it is necessary, before passing to the second part, to make some general statements concerning the nature of curved lines.

## SECOND BOOK
On the Nature of Curved Lines

The ancients were familiar with the fact that the problems of geometry may be divided into three classes, namely, plane, solid, and linear problems. This is equivalent to saying that some problems require only circles and straight lines for their construction, while others require a conic section and still others require more complex curves. I am surprised, however, that they did not go further, and distinguish between different degrees of these more complex curves, nor do I see why they called the latter mechanical, rather than geometrical.

## Second Book

If we say that they are called mechanical because some sort of instrument has to be used to describe them, then we must, to be consistent, reject circles and straight lines, since these cannot be described on paper without the use of compasses and a ruler, which may also be termed instruments. It is not because the other instruments, being more complicated than the ruler and compasses, are therefore less accurate, for if this were so they would have to be excluded from mechanics, in which accuracy of construction is even more important than in geometry. In the latter, exactness of reasoning alone is sought, and this can surely be as thorough with reference to such lines as to simpler ones. I cannot believe, either, that it was because they did not wish to make more than two postulates, namely, (1) a straight line can be drawn between any two points, and (2) about a given center a circle can be described passing through a given point. In their treatment of the conic sections they did not hesitate to introduce the assumption that any given cone can be cut by a given plane. Now to treat all the curves which I mean to introduce here, only one additional assumption is necessary, namely, two or more lines can be moved, one upon the other, determining by their intersection other curves. This seems to me in no way more difficult.

It is true that the conic sections were never freely received into ancient geometry, and I do not care to undertake to change names confirmed by usages; nevertheless, it seems very clear to me that if we make the usual assumption that geometry is precise and exact, while mechanics is not; and if we think of geometry as the science which furnishes a general knowledge of the measurement of all bodies, then we have no more right to exclude the more complex curves than the simpler ones, provided they can be conceived of as described by a continuous motion or by several successive motions, each motion being completely determined by those which precede; for in this way an exact knowledge of the magnitude of each is always obtainable.

Probably the real explanation of the refusal of ancient geometers to accept curves more complex than the conic sections lies in the fact that the first curves to which their attention was attracted happened to be the spiral, the quadratrix, and similar curves, which really do belong only to mechanics, and are not among those curves that I think should be included here, since they must be conceived of as described by two separate movements whose relation does not admit of exact determination. Yet they afterwards examined the conchoid, the cissoid, and a few others which should be accepted; but, not knowing much about their properties, they took no more account of these than of the others. Again, it may have been that, knowing as they did only a little about the conic sections, and being still ignorant of many of the possibilities of the ruler and compasses, they dared not yet attack a matter of still greater difficulties. I hope that hereafter those who are clever enough to make use of the geometric methods herein suggested will find no great difficulty in applying them to plane or solid problems. I therefore think it proper to suggest to such a more extended line of investigation which will furnish abundant opportunities for practice.

Consider the lines AB, AD, AF, and so forth, which we may suppose to be described by means of the instrument YZ. This instrument consists of several rulers hinged together in such a way that YZ being placed along the line AN the angle XYZ can be increased or decreased in size, and when its sides are together the points B, C, D, E, F, G, H all coincide with A; but as the size of the angle is increased, the ruler BC, fastened at right angles to XY at the point B, pushes toward Z the ruler CD which slides along YZ always at right angles. In like manner, CD pushes DE which slides along YX always parallel to BC; DE pushes EF; EF pushes FG; FG pushes GH, and so on. Thus we may imagine an infinity of rulers, each pushing another, half of them making equal angles with YX and the rest with YZ.

Now as the angle XYZ is increased the point B describes the curve AB, which is a circle; while the intersections of the other rulers, namely, the points D, F, H describe other curves, AD, AF, AH, of which the latter are more complex than the first, and this more complex than the circle. Nevertheless, I see no reason why the description of the first cannot be conceived as clearly and distinctly as that of the circle, or at least as that of the conic sections; or why that of the second, third, or any other that can be thus described, cannot be as clearly conceived of as the first; and therefore I see no reason why they should not be used in the same way in the solution of geometric problems.

I could give here several other ways of tracing and conceiving a series of curved lines, each curve more complex than any preceding one, but I think the best way to group together all such curves and then classify them in order, is by recognizing the fact that all points of those curves which we may call "geometric," that is, those which admit of precise and exact measurement, must bear a definite relation to all points of a straight line, and that this relation must be expressed by means of a single equation. If this equation contains no term of higher degree than the rectangle of two unknown quantities, or the square of one, the curve belongs to the first and simplest class, which contains only the circle, the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse; but when the equation contains one or more terms of the third or fourth degree in one or both of the two unknown quantities (for it requires two unknown quantities to express the relation between two points) the curve belongs to the second class; and if the equation contains a term of the fifth or sixth degree in either or both of the unknown quantities the curve belongs to the third class, and so on indefinitely.

Suppose the curve EC to be described by the intersection of the ruler GL and the rectilinear plane figure CNKL, whose side KN is produced indefinitely in the direction of C, and which, being moved in the same plane in such a way that its side KL always coincides with some part of the line BA (produced in both directions), imparts to the ruler GL a rotary motion about G (the ruler being hinged to the figure CNKL at L). If I wish to find out to what class this curve belongs, I choose a straight line, as AB, which to refer all its points, and in AB I choose a point A at which to begin the investigation. I say "choose this and that," because we are free to choose what we will, for, while it is necessary to use care in the choice in order to make the equation as short and simple as possible, yet no matter what line I should take instead of AB the curve would always prove to be of the same class, a fact easily demonstrated.

Then I take on the curve an arbitrary point, as C, at which we will suppose the instrument applied to describe the curve. Then I draw through C the line CB parallel to GA. Since CB and BA are unknown and indeterminate quantities, I shall call one of them y and the other x. To the relation between these quantities I must consider also the known quantities which determine the description of the curve, as GA, which I shall call a; KL, which I shall call b; and NL parallel to GA, which I shall call c. Then I say that as NL is to LK, or as c is to b, so CB, or y, is to BK, which is therefore equal to (b/c) y. Then BL is equal to (b/c) y − b, and AL is equal to x + (b/c) y − b.

Moreover, as CB is to BL, that is, as y is to ( (b y / c) − b ), so AG or a is to LA or x + (b y / c) − b. Multiplying the second by the third, we get

y · ( x + (b y / c) − b ) = a · ( (b y / c) − b ).

Multiplying both sides by c and arranging the terms, we obtain the equation

b y^2 + c x y − b(c + a) y + a b c = 0,

or, dividing by b,

y^2 + (c/b) x y − (c + a) y + a c = 0.

From this equation we see that the curve EC belongs to the first class; it being, in fact, a hyperbola.

If in the instrument used to describe the curve we substitute for the rectilinear figure CNKL this hyperbola or some other curve of the first class lying in the plane CNKL, the intersection of this curve with the ruler GL will describe, instead of the hyperbola EC, another curve, which will be of the second class.

Thus, if CNK be a circle having its center at L, we shall describe the first conchoid of the ancients, while if we use a parabola having KB as axis we shall describe the curve which, as I have already said, is the first and simplest of the curves required in the problem of Pappus, that is, the one which furnishes the solution when five lines are given in position.

If, instead of one of these curves of the first class, there be used a curve of the second class lying in the plane CNKL, a curve of the third class will be described; while if one of the third class be used, one of the fourth class will be obtained, and so on to infinity. These statements are easily proved by actual calculation.

Thus, no matter how we conceive a curve to be described, provided it be one of those which I have called geometric, it is always possible to find in this manner an equation determining all its points. Now I shall place curves whose equations are of the fourth degree in the same class with those whose equations are of the third degree; and those whose equations are of the sixth degree in the same class with those whose equations are of the fifth degree, and similarly for the rest. This classification is based upon the fact that there is a general rule for reducing to a cubic any equation of the fourth degree, and to an equation of the fifth degree any equation of the sixth degree, so that the latter in each case need not be considered any more complex than the former.

It should be observed, however, with regard to the curves of any one class, that while many of them are equally complex so that they may be employed to determine the same points and construct the same problems, yet there are certain simpler ones whose usefulness is more limited. Thus, among the curves of the first class, besides the ellipse, the hyperbola, and the parabola, which are equally complex, there is also found the circle, which is evidently a simpler curve; while among those of the second class we find the common conchoid, which is described by means of the circle, and some others which, though less complicated than many curves of the same class, cannot be placed in the first class.

Having now made a general classification of curves, it is easy for me to demonstrate the solution which I have already given of the problem of Pappus. For, first, I have shown that when there are only three or four lines the equation which serves to determine the required points is of the second degree. It follows that the curve containing these points must belong to the first class, since such an equation expresses the relation between all points of curves of Class I and all points of a fixed straight line. When there are not more than eight given lines the equation is at most a biquadratic, and therefore the resulting curve belongs to Class II or Class I. When there are not more than twelve given lines, the equation is of the sixth degree or lower, and therefore the required curve belongs to Class III or a lower class, and so on for other cases.

Now, since each of the given lines may have any conceivable position, and since any change in the position of a line produces a corresponding change in the values of the known quantities as well as in the signs + and − of the equation, it is clear that there is no curve of Class I that may not furnish a solution of this problem when it relates to four lines, and that there is no curve of Class II that may not furnish a solution when the problem relates to eight lines, none of Class III when it relates to twelve lines, etc. It follows that there is no geometric curve whose equation can be obtained that may not be used for some number of lines.

It is now necessary to determine more particularly and to give the method of finding the curve required in each case, for only three or four given lines. This investigation will show that Class I contains only the circle and the three conic sections.

Consider again the four lines AB, AD, EF, and GH, given before, and let it be required to find the locus generated by a point C, such that, if four lines CB, CD, CF, and CH be drawn through it making given angles with the given lines, the product of CB and CF is equal to the product of CD and CH. This is equivalent to saying that if

CB = y,

CF = ...,

CD = ...,

CH = ...,

then the equation is ...

(It is here assumed that eg is greater than ef; otherwise the signs + and − must all be changed. If y is zero or less than nothing in this equation, the point C being supposed to lie within the angle DAG, then C must be supposed to lie within one of the angles DAE, EAR, or RAG, and the signs must be changed to produce this result. If for each of these four positions y is equal to zero, then the problem admits of no solution in the case proposed.)

Let us suppose the solution possible, and to shorten the work let us write 2m instead of ... and − instead of ... Then we have ... of which the root is

y^2 = 2 m y − x y + ...

y = m − n x + ... .

Again, for the sake of brevity, put ... equal to o, and ... equal to 2 − 2 ; for these quantities being given, we can represent them in any way we please. Then we have

y = m − n x + ... ,

which must give the length of the line BC, leaving AB or x undetermined. Since the problem relates to only three or four lines, it is obvious that we shall always have such terms, although some of them may vanish and the signs may all vary.

After this, I make KI equal and parallel to BA, and cutting off on BC a segment BK equal to m (since the expression for BC contains +m; if this were −m, I should have drawn IK on the other side of AB, while if m were zero, I would not have drawn IK at all). Then I draw IL so that IK:KL = z:n; that is, so that if IK is equal to x, KL is equal to (z/n) x. In the same way I know the ratio of KL to IL, which I may call n:a, so that if KL is (z/n) x, IL is equal to (n/a) (z/n) x = (z/a) x. I take the point K between L and C, since the equation contains − x; if this were + x, I should take L between K and C; while if (z/n) were equal to zero, I should not draw IL.

This being done, there remains the expression

LC = sqrt( m^2 + o x + ... − x^2 )

from which to construct LC. It is clear that if this were zero the point C would lie on the straight line IL; that if it were a perfect square, that is, if ... and − x^2 were both + and was equal to 4 p m, or if m^2 and ox, or ox and − x^2, were zero, then the point C would lie on another straight line, whose position could be determined as easily as that of IL.

If none of these exceptional cases occur, the point C always lies on one of the three conic sections, or on a circle having its diameter in the line IL and having LC a line applied in order to this diameter, or, on the other hand, having LC parallel to a diameter and IL applied in order.

In particular, if the term − x^2 is zero, the conic section is a parabola; if it is preceded by a plus sign, it is a hyperbola; and, finally, if it is preceded by a minus sign, it is an ellipse. An exception occurs when a h n is equal to p z^2 and the angle ILC is a right angle, in which case we get a circle instead of an ellipse.

If the conic section is a parabola, its latus rectum is equal to ... and its axis always lies along the line IL. To find its vertex, N, make IN equal to (a m^2) / ... so that the point I lies between L and N if ... is positive and ox is positive; and L lies between I and N if ... is positive and ox negative; and N lies between I and L if ... is negative and ox positive. It is impossible that ... should be negative when the terms are arranged as above. Finally, if ... is equal to zero, the points N and I must coincide. It is thus easy to determine this parabola, according to the first problem of the first book of *Apollonius*.

If, however, the required locus is a circle, an ellipse, or a hyperbola, the point M, the center of the figure, must first be found. This will always lie on the line IL and may be found by taking IM equal to ...; when ... is equal to zero, M coincides with I. If the required locus is a circle or an ellipse, M and I must lie on the same side of I when the term ox is positive and on opposite sides when ox is negative. On the other hand, in the case of the hyperbola, M and L lie on the same side of I when ox is negative and on opposite sides when ox is positive.

The latus rectum of the figure must be

4 o^2 z^2 / n^2 ,

if ... is positive and the locus is a circle or an ellipse, or if ... is negative and the locus is a hyperbola. It must be

lo^2 z^2 / Amp z^2

if the required locus is a circle or an ellipse and ... is negative, or if it is a hyperbola and o^2 is greater than 4 m p, being positive.

But if ... is equal to zero, the latus rectum is ... ; and if ox is equal to zero, it is 4 4: m p z^2.

For the corresponding diameter a line must be found which bears the ratio to the latus rectum; that is, if the latus rectum is ... the diameter is

sqrt( a^2 + 4 m p z^2 ).

In every case, the diameter of the section lies along IM, and LC is one of its lines applied in order. It is thus evident that, by making MN equal to half the diameter and taking N and L on the same side of M, the point N will be the vertex of this diameter. It is then a simple matter to determine the curve, according to the second and third problems of the first book of *Apollonius*.

When the locus is a hyperbola and ... is positive, if ... is equal to zero or less than 4 p m we must draw the line MOP from the center M parallel to LC, and draw CP parallel to LM, and take MO equal to ... ; while if ox is equal to zero, MO must be taken equal to m. Then considering O as the vertex of this hyperbola, the diameter being OP and the line applied in order being CP, its latus rectum is ... and its diameter is ...

An exception must be made when ox is equal to zero, in which case the latus rectum is ... and the diameter is 2 m. From these data the curve can be determined in accordance with the third problem of the first book of *Apollonius*.

The demonstrations of the above statements are all very simple, for, forming the product of the quantities given above as latus rectum, diameter, and segment of the diameter NL or OP, by the methods of Theorems 11, 12, and 13 of the first book of *Apollonius*, the result will contain exactly the terms which express the square of the line CP or CL, which is an ordinate of this diameter.

In this case take IM or from NM or from its equal sqrt( o^2 + 4 m p ).

To the remainder IN add IL or − x, and we have

a = aom , am / ( ... ) − ...

Multiplying this by sqrt( o^2 + 4 m p ), the latus rectum of the curve, we get

x sqrt( o^2 + 4 m p ) − + 2 m^2

for the rectangle, from which is to be subtracted a rectangle which is to the square of NL as the latus rectum is to the diameter. The square of NL is

... ,

Divide this by a^m and multiply the quotient by p z^2, since these terms express the ratio between the diameter and the latus rectum. The result is

ox + x sqrt( o^2 + 4 m p ) + sqrt( o^2 + 4 m p ) + ...

This quantity being subtracted from the rectangle previously obtained, we get

CL^2 = m^2 + ox − x^2 / m.

It follows that CL is an ordinate of an ellipse or circle applied to NL, the segment of the axis.

Suppose all the given quantities expressed numerically, as EA = 3, AG = 5, AB = BR, BS = 1/2 BE, GB = BT, CD = 1/3 CR, CF = 2/3 CS, CH = 1/4 CT, the angle ABR = 60°; and let CB · CF = CD · CH. All these quantities must be known if the problem is to be entirely determined. Now let AB = x, and CB = y. By the method given above we shall obtain

y^2 = 2 y − x y + 5 x − ... ;

y = 1 − sqrt( 1 + 4 x − f x^2 );

whence BK must be equal to 1, and KL must be equal to one-half KI; and since the angle IKL = angle ABR = 60° and angle KIL (which is one-half angle KIB, or one-half angle IKL) is 30°, the angle ILK is a right angle. Since IK = AB = x, KL = (1/2) x, IL = x sqrt(3)/2, and the quantity represented by z above is 1, we have a = sqrt(3), m = 1, o = 4, p = 1/2, whence IM = sqrt(3)/2, NM = sqrt(3)/2, and since a^m (which is 1) is equal to ... and the angle ILC is a right angle, it follows that the curve NC is a circle. A similar treatment of any of the other cases offers no difficulty.

Since all equations of degree not higher than the second are included in the discussion just given, not only is the problem of the ancients relating to three or four lines completely solved, but also the whole problem of what they called the composition of solid loci, and consequently that of plane loci, since they are included under solid loci. For the solution of any one of these problems of loci is nothing more than the finding of a point for whose complete determination one condition is wanting, the other conditions being such that (as in this example) all the points of a single line will satisfy them. If the line is straight or circular, it is said to be a plane locus; but if it is a parabola, a hyperbola, or an ellipse, it is called a solid locus. In every such case an equation can be obtained containing two unknown quantities and entirely analogous to those found above. If the curve upon which the required point lies is of higher degree than the conic sections, it may be called in the same way a supersolid locus, and so on for other cases. If two conditions for the determination of the point are lacking, the locus of the point is a surface, which may be plane, spherical, or more complex. The ancients attempted nothing beyond the composition of solid loci, and it would appear that the sole aim of *Apollonius* in his treatise on the conic sections was the solution of problems of solid loci.

I have shown, further, that what I have termed the first class of curves contains no others besides the circle, the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse. This is what I undertook to prove.

If the problem of the ancients be proposed concerning five lines, the required point will evidently always lie on a straight line. Suppose it be proposed concerning five lines with the following conditions:

1. Four of these lines parallel and the fifth perpendicular to each of the others;

2. The lines drawn from the required point to meet the given lines at right angles;

3. The parallelepiped composed of the three lines drawn to meet three of the parallel lines must be equal to that composed of three lines, namely, the one drawn to meet the fourth parallel, the one drawn to meet the perpendicular, and a certain given line.

This is, with the exception of the preceding one, the simplest possible case. The point required will lie on a curve generated by the motion of a parabola in the following way:

Let the required lines be AB, IH, ED, GF, and GA, and let it be required to find the point C, such that if CB, CF, CD, CH, and CM be drawn perpendicular respectively to the given lines, the parallelepiped of the three lines CF, CD, and CH shall be equal to that of the other two, CB and CM, and a third line AI. Let CB = y, CM = x, AI or AE or GE = a; whence if C lies between AB and DE, we have CF = 2 a − y, CD = a − y, and CH = y + a. Multiplying these three together we get y^3 − 2 a y^2 − a^2 y + 2 a^3 equal to the product of the other three, namely to a x y.

I shall consider next the curve CEG, which I imagine to be described by the intersection of the parabola CKN (which is made to move so that its axis KL always lies along the straight line AB) with the ruler GL (which rotates about the point G in such a way that it constantly lies in the plane of the parabola and passes through the point L). I take KL equal to a and let the principal parameter, that is, the parameter corresponding to the axis of the given parabola, be also equal to a, and let GA = 2 a, CB or MA = y, CM or AB = x. Since the triangles GMC and CBL are similar, GM (or 2 a − y) is to MC (or x) as CB (or y) is to BL, which is therefore equal to

xy / (2 a − y).

Since KL is a, BK is (2 a − y) − 2 a + y = ... . Finally, since this same BK is a segment of the axis of the parabola, BK is to BC (its ordinate) as BC is to a (the latus rectum), whence we get

y^3 − 2 a y^2 − a^2 y + 2 a^3 = a x y^2

and therefore C is the required point.

The point C can be taken on any part of the curve CEG or of its adjunct cEGc, which is described in the same way as the former, except that the vertex of the parabola is turned in the opposite direction; or it may lie on their counterparts NIo and nIO, which are generated by the intersection of the line GL with the other branch of the parabola KN.

Again, suppose that the given parallel lines AB, IH, ED, and GF are not equally distant from one another and are not perpendicular to GA, and that the lines through C are oblique to the given lines.

In this case the point C will not always lie on a curve of just the same nature. This may even occur when no two of the given lines are parallel.

Next, suppose that we have four parallel lines, and a fifth line cutting them, such that the parallelepiped of three lines drawn through the point C (one to the cutting line and two to two of the parallel lines) is equal to the parallelepiped of two lines drawn through C to meet the other two parallels respectively and another given line. In this case the required point lies on a curve of different nature, namely, a curve such that, all the ordinates to its axis being equal to the ordinates of a conic section, the segments of the axis between the vertex and the ordinates bear the same ratio to a certain given line that this line bears to the segments of the axis of the conic section having equal ordinates.

I cannot say that this curve is less simple than the preceding; indeed, I have always thought the former should be considered first, since its description and the determination of its equation are somewhat easier.

I shall not stop to consider in detail the curves corresponding to the other cases, for I have not undertaken to give a complete discussion of the subject;

and having explained the method of determining an infinite number of points lying on any curve, I think I have furnished a way to describe them.

It is worthy of note that there is a great difference between this method in which the curve is traced by finding several points upon it, and that used for the spiral and similar curves. In the latter not any point of the required curve may be found at pleasure, but only such points as can be determined by a process simpler than that required for the composition of the curve. Therefore, strictly speaking, we do not find any one of its points, that is, not any one of those which are so peculiarly points of this curve that they cannot be found except by means of it. On the other hand, there is no point on these curves which supplies a solution for the proposed problem that cannot be determined by the method I have given.

But the fact that this method of tracing a curve by determining a number of its points taken at random applies only to curves that can be generated by a regular and continuous motion does not justify its exclusion from geometry. Nor should we reject the method in which a string or loop of thread is used to determine the equality or difference of two or more straight lines drawn from each point of the required curve to certain other points, or making fixed angles with certain other lines. We have used this method in *La Dioptrique* in the discussion of the ellipse and the hyperbola.

On the other hand, geometry should not include lines that are like strings, in that they are sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and I believe cannot be discovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based upon such ratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact. Nevertheless, since strings can be used in these constructions only to determine lines whose lengths are known, they should not be wholly excluded.

When the relation between all points of a curve and all points of a straight line is known, in the way I have already explained, it is easy to find the relation between the points of the curve and all other given points and lines; and from these relations to find its diameters, axes, center and other lines or points which have especial significance for this curve, and thence to conceive various ways of describing the curve, and to choose the easiest.

## SECOND BOOK — 317

By this method alone it is then possible to find out all that can be determined about the magnitude of their areas, and there is no need for further explanation from me.

Finally, all other properties of curves depend only on the angles which these curves make with other lines. But the angle formed by two intersecting curves can be as easily measured as the angle between two straight lines, provided that a straight line can be drawn making right angles with one of these curves at its point of intersection with the other. This is my reason for believing that I shall have given here a sufficient introduction to the study of curves when I have given a general method of drawing a straight line making right angles with a curve at an arbitrarily chosen point upon it. And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even the one I have ever desired to know.

Let CE be the given curve, and let it be required to draw through C a straight line making right angles with CE. Suppose the problem solved, and let the required line be CP. Produce CP to meet the straight line GA, to whose points the points of CE are to be related. Then, let MA or CB = y, and CM or BA = x. An equation must be found expressing the relation between x and y. I let PC = s, PA = v, whence FM = v − y. Since PMC is a right triangle, we see that s^2, the square of the hypotenuse, is equal to x^2 + (v − y)^2, the sum of the squares of the two sides. That is to say,

x^2 = s^2 − v^2 + 2vy − y^2,

or

y = v ± sqrt(s^2 − x^2).

By means of these last two equations, I can eliminate one of the two quantities x and y from the equation expressing the relation between the points of the curve CE and those of the straight line GA. If x is to be eliminated, this may easily be done by replacing x wherever it occurs by sqrt(s^2 − v^2 + 2vy − y^2), x^2 by the square of this expression, x^3 by its cube, etc., while if y is to be eliminated, y must be replaced by v ± sqrt(s^2 − x^2) and y^2, y^3, ... by the square of this expression, its cube, and so on. The result will be an equation in only one unknown quantity, x or y.

For example, if CE is an ellipse, MA the segment of its axis of which CM is an ordinate, r its latus rectum, and q its transverse axis, then by Theorem 13, Book I, of Apollonius, we have

x^2 = r y − (y^2)/q.

Eliminating x^2, the resulting equation is

s^2 − v^2 + 2vy − y^2 = r y − (y^2)/q,

or

q r y − 2 q v y + q v^2 − q s^2 = 0.

In this case it is better to consider the whole as constituting a single expression than as consisting of two equal parts.

If CE be the curve generated by the motion of a parabola (see pages 306, 307) already discussed, and if we represent GA by b, KL by c, and the parameter of the axis KL of the parabola by d, the equation expressing the relation between x and y is

y^2 − b y^? − c d y + b c d + d x y = 0.

Eliminating x, we have

y^2 − b y^? − c d y + b c d + d y sqrt(s^2 − v^2 + 2 v y − y^2) = 0.

Arranging the terms according to the powers of y by squaring, this becomes

s^2 − 2 b s^2 + (b^2 − 2 c d + d^2) y^4 − 2 d h y^3
+ (c^2 d^2 − d^4 + d^2 v − 2 b c d) y^2 − 2 b c h^3 y + b^2 c^2 − d^4 = 0,

and so for the other cases. If the points of the curve are not related to those of a straight line in the way explained, but are related in some other way, such an equation can always be found.

Let CE be a curve which is so related to the points F, G, and A, that a straight line drawn from any point on it, as C, to F exceeds the line FA by a quantity which bears a given ratio to the excess of GA over the line drawn from the point C to G. Let GA = b, AF = c, and taking an arbitrary point C on the curve let the quantity by which CF exceeds FA be to the quantity by which GA exceeds GC as d is to c. Then if we let z represent the undetermined quantity, FC = c + z and GC = b − z/d. Let MA = y, GM = b − y, and FM = c + y. Since CMG is a right triangle, taking the square of GM from the square of GC we have left the square of CM, or (b − z/d)^2 − (b − y)^2 = —2 b? No — the difference of squares equals the square of CM; simplifying yields an expression for CM in terms of the other quantities.

Again, taking the square of FM from the square of FC we have the square of CM expressed in another way, namely: z^2 − 2 c z + c^2 − 2 c y − y^2. These two expressions being equal they will yield the value of y or MA, which is

y = (d^2 z^2 + 2 c d z − z + 2 b d c z) / (2 b d^2 + 2 e d^2).

Substituting this value for y in the expression for the square of CM, we have

[expression for CM^2 given by substituting the value of y],

If now we suppose the line PC to meet the curve at right angles at C, and let PC = s and PA = v, as before, PM is equal to v − y; and since PCM is a right triangle, we have s^2 = v^2 + 2 v y − y^2 for the square of CM. Substituting for y its value, and equating the values of the square of CM, we have

[complicated algebraic equation in v and s]

for the required equation.

Such an equation having been found it is to be used, not to determine x, y, or z, which are known, since the point C is given, but to find v or s, which determine the required point P. With this in view, observe that if the point P fulfills the required conditions, the circle about P as center and passing through the point C will touch but not cut the curve CE; but if this point P be ever so little nearer to, or farther from, A than it should be, this circle must cut the curve not only at C but also in another point. Now if this circle cuts CE, the equation involving x and y as unknown quantities (supposing PA and PC known) must have two unequal roots. Suppose, for example, that the circle cuts the curve in the points C and E. Draw EQ parallel to CM. Then x and y may be used to represent EQ and QA respectively in just the same way as they were used to represent CM and MA; since PE is equal to PC (being radii of the same circle), if we seek EQ and QA (supposing PE and PA given) we shall get the same equation that we should obtain by seeking CM and MA (supposing PC and PA given). It follows that the value of x, or y, or any other such quantity, will be two-fold in this equation, that is, the equation will have two unequal roots. If the value of x be required, one of these roots will be CM and the other EQ; while if y be required, one root will be MA and the other QA. It is true that if E is not on the same side of the curve as C, only one of these will be a true root, the other being drawn in the opposite direction, or less than nothing.

The nearer together the points C and E are taken, however, the less difference there is between the roots; and when the points coincide, the roots are exactly equal, that is to say, the circle through C will touch the curve CE at the point C without cutting it.

Furthermore, it is to be observed that when an equation has two equal roots, its left-hand member must be similar in form to the expression obtained by multiplying by itself the difference between the unknown quantity and a known quantity equal to it; and then, if the resulting expression is not of as high a degree as the original equation, multiplying it by another expression which will make it of the same degree. This last step makes the two expressions correspond term by term.

## SECOND BOOK — 320

For example, I say that the first equation found in the present discussion, namely

q r y − 2 q v y + q v^2 − q s^2 = 0

must be of the same form as the expression obtained by making e = y and multiplying y − e by itself, that is, as y^2 − 2 e y + e^2. We may then compare the two expressions term by term, thus: since the first term, y^2, is the same in each, the second term of the first is equal to −2 e y, the second term of the second; whence, solving for y, or PA, we have e = (6 + ?)/r. Or, since we have assumed e equal to y, v = y − y + r. In the same way, we can find s from the third term, q v^2 − q s^2; but since v completely determines P, which is all that is required, it is not necessary to go further.

In the same way, the second equation found above, namely,

s^2 − 2 b s^2 + (b^2 − 2 c d + d^2) y^4 − 2 d h y^3
+ (c^2 d^2 − d^4 + d^2 v − 2 b c d) y^2 − 2 b c h^3 y + b^2 c^2 − d^4 = 0,

must have the same form as the expression obtained by multiplying

(y^2 − 2 e y + e^2) by (y^2 + f z + g v + h^2 y + f^2),

that is, as

y^6 + (f − 2 e) y^5 + (g^2 − 2 e f + e^2) y^4 + (h^2 − 2 e g + e^2) y^3
+ (−2 e h^2 + e^2 g) y^2 + (e^2 h^2 − 2 e k) y + e^2 k^2.

From these two equations, six others may be obtained, which serve to determine the six quantities f, g, h, k, v, and s. It is easily seen that to whatever class the given curve may belong, this method will always furnish just as many equations as we necessarily have unknown quantities. In order to solve these equations, and ultimately to find v, which is the only value really wanted (the others being used only as means of finding v), we first determine f, the first unknown in the above expression, from the second term. Thus, f = 2 c − 26. Then in the last terms we can find k, the last unknown in the same expression, from which k = 2 c^2 d^2 / ??. From the third term we get the second quantity

g^2 = 3 e^2 + 4 b e − 2 c d + b^2 + d^2.

From the next to the last term we get 6, the next to the last quantity, which is

(262 c^2 v − 26 c^2 r^2) / p^3.

In the same way we should proceed in this order, until the last quantity is found.

## SECOND BOOK — 321

Then from the corresponding term (here the fourth) we may find v, and we have

[expressions for coefficients],

or putting y for its equal e, we get

2 y^2  5 b y − b^2 y + 2 c y  2 b c  b c^2  b^2 c^2

for the length of AP.

Again, the third equation, namely,

2 z + 2 b c d z^2 − 2 b c d e z − 2 c d h z − 2 b d e v z − b d h^2 + b d v − c d h^2 + c d h^2

+ b d^2 + c e^2 + e^2 v − d^2 v = 0

is of the same form as z^2 − 2 f z + p where f = 2, so that −2 f or −2 z must be equal to

2 b c d^2 − 2 b c d e − 2 c d h − 2 b d e v
b d^2 + c e^2 + e^2 − d h^2.

whence

b c d^2 − b c d e + b d^2 z + c e h
c d^2 + b d e − e^2 z + d^2 z.

Therefore, if we take AP equal to the above value of all the terms of which are known, and join the point P thus determined to C, this line will cut the curve CE at right angles, which was required. I see no reason why this solution should not apply to every curve to which the methods of geometry are applicable.

It should be observed regarding the expression taken arbitrarily to raise the original product to the required degree, as we just now took, that the signs + and − may be chosen at will, without producing different values of v or AP. This is easily found to be the case, but if I should stop to demonstrate every theorem I use, it would require a much larger volume than I wish to write. I desire rather to tell you in passing that this method, of which you have here an example, of supposing two equations to be of the same form in order to compare them term by term and so to obtain several equations from one, will apply to an infinity of other problems and is not the least important feature of my general method.

I shall not give the constructions for the required tangents and normals in connection with the method just explained, since it is always easy to find them, although it often requires some ingenuity to get short and simple methods of construction.

Given, for example, CD, the first conchoid of the ancients. Let A be its pole and BH the ruler, so that the segments of all straight lines, as CE and DB, converging toward A and included between the curve CD and the straight line BH, are equal. Let it be required to find a line CG normal to the curve at the point C. In trying to find the point on BH through which CG must pass (according to the method just explained), we would involve ourselves in a calculation as long as, or longer than any of those just given, and yet the resulting construction would be very simple. For we need only take CF on CA equal to CH, the perpendicular to BH; then through F draw FG parallel to BA and equal to EA, thus determining the point G, through which the required line CG must pass.

To show that a consideration of these curves is not without its use, and that they have diverse properties of no less importance than those of the conic sections, I shall add a discussion of certain ovals which you will find very useful in the theory of catoptrics and dioptrics. They may be described in the following way:

Drawing the two straight lines FA and AR intersecting at A under any angle, I choose arbitrarily a point F on one of them (more or less distant from A according as the oval is to be large or small). With F as center I describe a circle cutting FA at a point a little beyond A, as at the point 5.

I then draw the straight line 5G cutting AR at G, so that AG is less than A5, and so that AG is to A5 in any given ratio, as, for example, that which measures the refraction, if the oval is to be used for dioptrics. This being done, I take an arbitrary point G in the line FA on the same side as the point 5, so that AF is to GA in any given ratio. Next, along the line A6 I lay off RA equal to GA, and with G as center and a radius equal to R6 I describe a circle. This circle will cut the first one in two points 1, 1, through which the first of the required ovals must pass.

Next, with F as center I describe a circle which cuts FA a little nearer to, or farther from, A than the point 5, as, for example, at the point 7. I then draw 78 parallel to 56, and with G as center and a radius equal to R8 I describe another circle. This circle will cut the one through 7 in the points 1, 1, which are points of the same oval. We can thus find as many points as may be desired, by drawing lines parallel to 78 and describing circles with F and G as centers.

In the construction of the second oval the only difference is that instead of AR we must take AS on the other side of A, equal to AG, and that the radius of the circle about G cutting the circle about F and passing through 5 must be equal to the line S6; or if it is to cut the circle through 7 it must be equal to S8, and so on. In this way the circles intersect in the points 2, 2, which are points of this second oval A2X.

To construct the third and fourth ovals, instead of AG I take AH on the other side of A, that is, on the same side as F. It should be observed that this line AH must be greater than AF, which in any of these ovals may even be zero, in which case F and A coincide. Then, taking AR and AS each equal to AH, to describe the third oval, A3Y, I draw a circle about H as center with a radius equal to S6 and cutting in the point 3 the circle about F passing through 5, and another with a radius equal to S8 cutting the circle through 7 in the point also marked 3, and so on.

Finally, for the fourth oval, I draw circles about H as center with radii equal to R6, R8, and so on, and cutting the other circles in the points marked 4.

There are many other ways of describing these same ovals. For example, the first one, AV (provided we assume FA and AG equal) might be traced as follows:

Divide the line FG at L so that FL : LG = A5 : A6, that is, in the ratio corresponding to the index of refraction. Then bisecting AL at K, turn a ruler FE about the point F, pressing with the finger at C the cord EC, which, being attached at E to the end of the ruler, passes from C to K and then back to C and from C to G, where its other end is fastened. Thus the entire length of the cord is composed of GA + AL + FE − AF, and the point C will describe the first oval in a way similar to that in which the ellipse and hyperbola are described in *La Dioptrique*. But I cannot give any further attention to this subject.

Although these ovals seem to be of almost the same nature, they nevertheless belong to four different classes, each containing an infinity of subclasses, each of which in turn contains as many different kinds as does the class of ellipses or of hyperbolas; the subclasses depending upon the value of the ratio of A5 to A6. Then, as the ratio of AF to AG, or of AF to AH changes, the ovals of each subclass change in kind, and the length of AG or AH determines the size of the oval.

If A5 is equal to A6, the ovals of the first and third classes become straight lines; while among those of the second class we have all possible hyperbolas, and among those of the fourth all possible ellipses.

In the case of each oval it is necessary further to consider two portions having different properties. In the first oval the portion toward A (see Fig. 27) causes rays passing through the air from F to converge towards G upon meeting the convex surface A1 of a lens whose index of refraction, according to dioptrics, determines such ratios as that of A5 to A6, by means of which the oval is described.

But the portion toward V causes all rays coming from G to converge toward F when they strike the concave surface of a mirror of the shape of M1 and of such material that it diminishes the velocity of these rays in the ratio of A5 to A6, for it is proved in dioptrics that in this case the angles of reflection will be unequal as well as the angles of refraction, and can be measured in the same way.

Now consider the second oval. Here, too, the portion 2A2 (see Fig. 23) serves for reflections of which the angles may be assumed unequal. For if the surface of a mirror of the same material as in the case of the first oval be of this form, it will reflect all rays from G, making them seem to come from F. Observe, too, that if the line AG is considerably greater than AF, such a mirror will be convex in the center (toward A) and concave at each end; for such a curve would be heart-shaped rather than oval. The other part, X2, is useful for refracting lenses; rays which pass through the air toward F are refracted by a lens whose surface has this form.

The third oval is of use only for refraction, and causes rays traveling through the air toward F to move through the glass toward H, after they have passed through the surface whose form is A3Y3, which is convex throughout except toward A, where it is slightly concave, so that this curve is also heart-shaped. The difference between the two parts of this oval is that the one part is nearer F and farther from H, while the other is nearer H and farther from F.

Similarly, the last of these ovals is useful only in the case of reflection. Its effect is to make all rays coming from H and meeting the concave surface of a mirror of the same material as those previously discussed, and of the form A4Z4, converge towards F after reflection.

The points F, G and H may be called the “burning points” of these ovals, to correspond to those of the ellipse and hyperbola, and they are so named in dioptrics.

I have not mentioned several other kinds of reflection and refraction that are effected by these ovals; for being merely reverse or opposite effects they are easily deduced.

I must not, however, fail to prove the statements already made. For this purpose, take any point C on the first part of the first oval, and draw the straight line PC normal to the curve at C. This can be done by the method given above, as follows:

## SECOND BOOK — 327

Let AG = b, AF = c, FC = c + z. Suppose the ratio of d to e, which I always take here to measure the refractive power of the lens under consideration, to represent the ratio of A5 to A6 or similar lines used to describe the oval. Then

GC = b − z/d,

whence

y = (b c d^2 − b c d e + b d^2 z + c e h) / (c d^2 + b d e − e^2 z + d^2 z).

From P draw PQ perpendicular to FC, and PN perpendicular to GC. Now if PQ : PN = d : e, that is, if PQ : PN is equal to the same ratio as that between the lines which measure the refraction of the convex glass AC, then a ray passing from F to C must be refracted toward G upon entering the glass. This follows at once from dioptrics.

Now let us determine by calculation if it be true that PQ : PN = d : e. The right triangles PQF and CMF are similar, whence CF : CM = FP : PQ, and FP • CM / CF = PQ. Again, the right triangles PNG and CMG are similar, and therefore GP • CM / CG = PN. Now since the multiplication or division of two terms of a ratio by the same number does not alter the ratio, and CF • GP : FP • CG = d : e, then, dividing each term of the first ratio by CM and multiplying each by both CF and CG, we have FP • CG : GP • CF = d : e. Now by construction,

CG = b − z/d,

and

CF = c + z.

Then computing the products and simplifying, the first of these products divided by d is equal to the second divided by e, whence it follows that PQ : PN = FP • CG : GP • CF = d : e, which was to be proved. This proof may be made to hold for the reflecting and refracting properties of any one of these ovals, by proper changes of the signs plus and minus; and as each can be investigated by the reader, there is no need for further discussion here.

It now becomes necessary for me to supplement the statements made in my *Dioptrique* to the effect that lenses of various forms serve equally well to cause rays coming from the same point and passing through them to converge to another point; and that among such lenses those which are convex on one side and concave on the other are more powerful burning-glasses than those which are convex on both sides; while, on the other hand, the latter make the better telescopes. I shall describe and explain only those which I believe to have the greatest practical value, taking into consideration the difficulties of cutting. To complete the theory of the subject, I shall now have to describe again the form of lens which has one side of any desired degree of convexity or concavity, and which makes all the rays that are parallel or that come from a single point converge after passing through it; and also the form of lens having the same effect but being equally convex on both sides, or such that the convexity of one of its surfaces bears a given ratio to that of the other.

In the first place, let G, Y, C, and F be given points, such that rays coming from or parallel to GA converge at F after passing through a concave lens. Let Y be the center of the inner surface of this lens and C its edge, and let the chord CMC be given, and also the altitude of the arc CYC. First we...

must determine which of these ovals can be used for a lens that will cause rays passing through it in the direction of H (a point as yet undetermined) to converge toward F after leaving it.

There is no change in the direction of rays by means of reflection or refraction which cannot be effected by at least one of these ovals; and it is easily seen that this particular result can be obtained by using either part of the third oval, marked 3A3 or 3Y3, or the part of the second oval marked 2X2 (see Figs. 23, 24). Since the same method applied to each of these, we may in each case take Y as the vertex, C as a point on the curve, and F as one

## SECOND BOOK 329

of the foci. It then remains to determine H, the other focus. This may be found by considering that the difference between FY and FC is to the difference between HY and HC as `d` is to `c`; that is, as the longer of the lines measuring the refractive power of the lens is to the shorter, as is evident from the manner of describing the ovals.

Since the lines FY and FC are given, we know their difference; and then, since the ratio of the two differences is known, we know the difference between HY and HC.

```

Fig. 29

Again, since YM is known, we know the difference between MH and HC, and therefore CM. It remains to find MH, the side of the right triangle CMH. The other side of this triangle, CM, is known, and also the difference between the hypotenuse, CH and the required side, MH. We can therefore easily determine MH as follows:

Let `h = CH - MH` and `n = CM`; then `(n^ - h^)/(2h) = MH`, which determines the position of the point H.

If HY is greater than HF, the curve CY must be the first part of the third class of oval, which has already been designated by 3A3.

But suppose that HY is less than FY. This includes two cases: In the first, HY exceeds HF by such an amount that the ratio of their difference to the whole line FY is greater than the ratio of `e`, the smaller of the two lines that represent the refractive power, to `d`, the larger; that is, if `HF = c`, and `HY = cd/h`, then `dh` is greater than `2ce + eh`. In this case CY must be the second part 3Y3 of the same oval of the third class.

In the second case `dh` is less than or equal to `2ce + eh`; and CY is the second part 2X2 of the oval of the second class.

Finally, if the points H and F coincide, FY = FC and the curve YC is a circle.

It is also necessary to determine CAC, the other surface of the lens. If we suppose the rays falling on it to be parallel, this will be an ellipse having H as one of its foci, and the form is easily determined. If, however, we suppose the rays to come from the point G, the lens must have the form of the first part of an oval of the first class, the two foci of which are G and H, and which passes through the point C. The point A is seen to be its vertex from the fact that the excess of GC over GA is to the excess of HA over HC as `d` is to `e`. For if `k` represents the difference between CH and HM, and `x` represents AM, then `x - k` will represent the difference between AH and CH; and

## GEOMETRY 330

if `g` represents the difference between GC and GM, which are given, `g + x` will represent the difference between GC and GA; and since `g + x : x - k = d : e`, we have `eg + ex = dx - dk`, or `AM = x = (eg + dk)/(d - e)`, which enables us to determine the required point A.

Again, suppose that only the points G, C, and F are given, together with the ratio of AM to YM; and let it be required to determine the form of the lens ACY which causes all the rays coming from the point G to converge to F.

Fig. 30

In this case, we can use two ovals, AC and CY, with foci G and H, and F and H respectively. To determine these, let us suppose first that H, the focus common to both, is known. Then AM is determined by the three points, G, C, and H in the way just now explained; that is if `k` represents the difference between CH and HM, and `g` the difference between GC and GM, and if AC be the first part of the oval of the first class, we have `AM = (ge + dk)/(d - e)`.

We may then find MY by means of the three points F, C, and H. If CY is the first part of an oval of the third class and we take `y` for MY and `f` for the difference between CF and FM, we have the difference between CF and FY equal to `f + y`; then let the difference between CH and HM equal `k`, and the difference between CH and HY equal `k + y`. Now `k + y : f + y = c : d`, since the oval is of the third class, whence `MY = (cf - dk)/(d - c)`. Therefore, `AM + MY = AY`. From this it follows that on whichever side the point H may lie, the ratio of the line AY to the excess of GC + CF over GF is always equal to the ratio of `e`, the smaller of the two lines representing the refractive power of the glass, to `d - e`, the difference of these two lines, which gives a very interesting theorem.

The line AY being found, it must be divided in the proper ratio into AM and MY, and since M is known the points A and Y, and finally the point H, may be found by the preceding problem. We must first find whether the line AM thus found is greater than, equal to, or less than `(ge + dk)/(d - e)`. If it is greater, AC must be the first part of one of the third class, as they have been considered here. If it is smaller, CY must be the first part of an oval of the first class and AC the first part of one of the third class. Finally, if AM is equal to `(ge + dk)/(d - e)`, the curves AC and CY must both be hyperbolas.

## THIRD BOOK 331

These two problems can be extended to an infinity of other cases which I will not stop to deduce, since they have no practical value in dioptrics.

I might go farther and show how, if one surface of a lens is given and is neither entirely plane nor composed of conic sections or circles, the other surface can be so determined as to transmit all the rays from a given point to another point, also given. This is no more difficult than the problems I have just explained; indeed, it is much easier since the way is now open; I prefer, however, to leave this for others to work out, to the end that they may appreciate the more highly the discovery of those things here demonstrated, through having themselves to meet some difficulties.

In all this discussion I have considered only curves that can be described upon a plane surface, but my remarks can easily be made to apply to all those curves which can be conceived of as generated by the regular movement of the points of a body in three-dimensional space. This can be done by dropping perpendiculars from each point of the curve under consideration upon two planes intersecting at right angles, for the ends of these perpendiculars will describe two other curves, one in each of the two planes, all points of which may be determined in the way already explained, and all of which may be related to those of a straight line common to the two planes; and by means of these the points of the three-dimensional curve will be entirely determined.

We can even draw a straight line at right angles to this curve at a given point, simply by drawing a straight line in each plane normal to the curve lying in that plane at the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the given point of the three-dimensional curve to that plane and then drawing two other planes, each passing through one of the straight lines and perpendicular to the plane containing it; the intersection of these two planes will be the required normal.

And so I think I have omitted nothing essential to an understanding of curved lines.

## THIRD BOOK

### On the Construction of Solid and Supersolid Problems

While it is true that every curve which can be described by a continuous motion should be recognized in geometry, this does not mean that we should use at random the first one that we meet in the construction of a given problem. We should always choose with care the simplest curve that can be used in the solution of a problem, but it should be noted that the simplest means not merely the one most easily described, nor the one that leads to the easiest demonstration or construction of the problem, but rather the one of the simplest class that can be used to determine the required quantity.

For example, there is, I believe, no easier method of finding any number of mean proportionals, nor one whose demonstration is clearer, than the one which employs the curves described by the instrument XYZ, previously explained. Thus, if two mean proportionals between YA and YE be re-

## GEOMETRY 332

quired, it is only necessary to describe a circle upon YE as diameter, cutting the curve AD in D, and YD is then one of the required mean proportionals. The demonstration becomes obvious as soon as the instrument is applied to YD, since YA (or YB) is to YC as YC is to YD as YD is to YE.

Similarly, to find four mean proportionals between YA and YG, or six between YA and YN, it is only necessary to draw the circle YFG, which determines by its intersection with AF the line YF, one of the four mean proportionals; or the circle YHN, which determines by its intersection with AH the line YH, one of the six mean proportionals, and so on.

But the curve AD is of the second class, while it is possible to find two mean proportionals by the use of the conic sections, which are curves of the first class. Again, four or six mean proportionals can be found by curves of lower classes than AF and AH respectively. It would therefore be a geometric error to use these curves. On the other hand, it would be a blunder to try vainly to construct a problem by means of a class of lines simpler than its nature allows.

Before giving the rules for the avoidance of both these errors, some general statements must be made concerning the nature of equations. An equation consists of several terms, some known and some unknown, some of which are together equal to the rest; or rather, all of which taken together are equal to nothing; for this is often the best form to consider.

Every equation can have as many distinct roots (values of the unknown quantity) as the number of dimensions of the unknown quantity in the equation. Suppose, for example, `x = 2` or `x - 2 = 0`, and again, `x = 3`, or `x - 3 = 0`. Multiplying together the two equations `x - 2 = 0` and `x - 3 = 0`, we have `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0`, or `x^2 = 5x - 6`. This is an equation in which `x` has the value 2 and at the same time `x` has the value 3. If we next make `x - 4 = 0`

## THIRD BOOK 333

and multiply this by `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0`, we have `x^3 - 9x^2 + 26x - 24 = 0`, another equation, in which `x`, having three dimensions, has also three values, namely 2, 3, and 4.

It often happens, however, that some of the roots are false or less than nothing. Thus, if we suppose `x` to represent the defect of a quantity 5, we have `x + 5 = 0` which, multiplied by `x^3 - 9x^2 + 26x - 24 = 0`, yields `x^4 - 4x^3 - 19x^2 + 106x - 120 = 0`, an equation having four roots, namely three true roots, 2, 3, and 4, and one false root, -5.

It is evident from the above that the sum of an equation having several roots is always divisible by a binomial consisting of the unknown quantity diminished by the value of one of the true roots, or plus the value of one of the false roots. In this way, the degree of an equation can be lowered.

On the other hand, if the sum of the terms of an equation is not divisible by a binomial consisting of the unknown quantity plus or minus some other quantity, then this latter quantity is not a root of the equation. Thus the above equation `x^4 - 4x^3 - 19x^2 + 106x - 120 = 0` is divisible by `x - 2`, `x - 3`, `x - 4` and `x + 5`, but is not divisible by `x` plus or minus any other quantity. Therefore the equation can have only the four roots, 2, 3, 4, and -5. We can determine also the number of true and false roots that any equation can have, as follows: An equation can have as many true roots as it contains changes of sign, from `+` to `-` or from `-` to `+`; and as many false roots as the number of times two `+` signs or two `-` signs are found in succession.

Thus, in the last equation, since `+x^4` is followed by `-4x^3`, giving a change of sign from `+` to `-`, and `-19x^2` is followed by `+106x`, and `+106x` by `-120`, giving two more changes, we know there are three true roots; and since `-4x^3` is followed by `-19x^2` there is one false root.

It is also easy to transform an equation so that all the roots that were false shall become true roots, and all those that were true shall become false. This is done by changing the signs of the second, fourth, sixth, and all even terms, leaving unchanged the signs of the first, third, fifth, and other odd terms. Thus, if instead of

`+x^4 - 4x^3 - 19x^2 + 106x - 120 = 0`

we write

`+x^4 + 4x^3 - 19x^2 - 106x - 120 = 0`

we get an equation having one true root, 5, and three false roots, -2, -3, and -4.

If the roots of an equation are unknown and it be desired to increase or diminish each of these roots by some known number, we must substitute for the unknown quantity throughout the equation, another quantity greater or less by the given number. Thus, if it be desired to increase by 3 the value of each root of the equation

`x^4 + 4x^3 - 19x^2 - 106x - 120 = 0`

put `y` in the place of `x`, and let `y` exceed `x` by 3, so that `y - 3 = x`. Then for `x^2` put the square of `y - 3`, or `y^2 - 6y + 9`; for `x^3` put its cube, `y^3 - 9y^2 + 27y - 27`; and for `x^4` put its fourth power, or

`y^4 - 12y^3 + 54y^2 - 108y + 81`.

## GEOMETRY 334

Substituting these values in the above equation, and combining, we have

```
  y^4 - 12y^3 + 54y^2 - 108y + 81
+  4y^3 - 36y^2 + 108y - 108
- 19y^2 + 114y - 171
- 106y + 318
- 120
--------------------------
  y^4 -  8y^3 -  y^2 +   8y  = 0,
```

or

`y^3 - 8y^2 - y + 8 = 0`,

whose true root is now 8 instead of 5, since it has been increased by 3. If, on the other hand, it is desired to diminish by 3 the roots of the same equation, we must put `y + 3 = x` and `y^2 + 6y + 9 = x^2`, and so on, so that instead of `x^4 + 4x^3 - 19x^2 - 106x - 120 = 0`, we have

```
  y^4 + 12y^3 + 54y^2 + 108y + 81
+  4y^3 + 36y^2 + 108y + 108
- 19y^2 - 114y - 171
- 106y - 318
- 120
--------------------------
  y^4 + 16y^3 + 71y^2 -  4y - 420 = 0.
```

It should be observed that increasing the true roots of an equation diminishes the false roots by the same amount; and, on the contrary, diminishing the true roots increases the false roots; while diminishing either a true or a false root by a quantity equal to it makes the root zero; and diminishing it by a quantity greater than the root renders a true root false or a false root true. Thus by increasing the true root 5 by 3, we diminish each of the false roots, so that the root previously -4 is now only -1, the root previously -3 is zero, and the root previously -2 is now a true root, equal to 1, since `-2 + 3 = +1`. This explains why the equation `y^3 - 8y^2 - y + 8 = 0` has only three roots, two of them, 1 and 8, being true roots, and the third, also -1, being false; while the other equation `y^4 + 16y^3 + 71y^2 - 4y - 420 = 0` has only one true root, 2, since `+5 - 3 = +2`, and three false roots, -5, -6, and -7.

Now this method of transforming the roots of an equation without determining their values yields two results which will prove useful: First, we can always remove the second term of an equation by diminishing its true roots by the known quantity of the second term divided by the number of dimensions of the first term, if these two terms have opposite signs; or, if they have like signs, by increasing the roots by the same quantity. Thus, to remove the second term of the equation `y^4 + 16y^3 + 71y^2 - 4y - 420 = 0` I divide 16 by 4 (the exponent of `y` in `y^4`), the quotient being 4. I then make `z - 4 = y` and write

```
  z^4 - 16z^3 +  96z^2 - 256z + 256
+ 16z^3 - 192z^2 + 768z - 1024
+        71z^2 - 568z + 1136
-         4z +   16
-         420
----------------------------------
  z^4 - 25z^2 - 60z - 36 = 0.
```

## THIRD BOOK 335

The true root of this equation which was 2 is now 6, since it has been increased by 4, and the false roots, -5, -6, and -7, are only -1, -2, and -3, since each has been diminished by 4. Similarly, to remove the second term of `x^4 - 2ax^3 + (2a^2 - c^2)x^2 - 2a^3x + a^4 = 0`; since `2a / 4 = a/2` we must put `z + a/2 = x` and write

`z^4 + ((1/2)a^2 - c^2)z^2 - (a^3 + ac^2)z + ((5/16)a^4 - (1/4)a^2c^2) = 0`.

Having found the value of `z`, that of `x` is found by adding `a/2`. Second, by increasing the roots by a quantity greater than any of the false roots we make all the roots true. When this is done, there will be no two consecutive `+` or `-` terms; and further, the known quantity of the third term will be greater than the square of half that of the second term. This can be done even when the false roots are unknown, since approximate values can always be obtained for them and the roots can then be increased by a quantity as large as, or larger than, is required. Thus, given,

`x^6 - 30n^2x^4 + 504n^4x^2 - 3780n^6 = 0`,

make `y - n = x` and we have,

`y^6 - 30n^2y^4 + 504n^4y^2 - 3780n^6 = 0`.

Now it is evident that `504n^4`, the known quantity of the third term, is larger than `225n^4`, that is, than the square of half that of the second term; and there is no case for which the true roots need be increased by a quantity larger in proportion to those given than for this one.

If it is undesirable to have the last term zero, as in this case, the roots must be increased just a little more, yet not too little, for the purpose. Similarly, if it is desired to raise the degree of an equation, and also to have all its terms present, as if instead of `x^6 - b = 0`, we wish an equation of the sixth degree with no term zero, first, for `x^6 - b = 0` write `x^6 - bx = 0`, and letting `y - a = x`, we have

`y^6 - 6ay^5 + 15a^2y^4 - 20a^3y^3 + 15a^4y^2 - (6a^5 + b)y + a^6 + ab = 0`.

It is evident that, however small the quantity `a`, every term of this equation must be present.

We can also multiply or divide all the roots of an equation by a given

## GEOMETRY 336

quantity, without first determining their values. To do this, suppose the unknown quantity when multiplied or divided by the given number to be equal to a second unknown quantity. Then multiply or divide the known quantity of the second term by the given quantity, that in the third term by the square of the given quantity, that in the fourth term by its cube, and so on, to the end.

This device is useful in changing fractional terms of an equation to whole numbers, and often in rationalizing the terms. Thus, given `x^3 - \sqrt{3}x^2 + (26/3)x - 8\sqrt{3} = 0`, let there be required another equation in which all the terms are expressed in rational numbers. Let `y = x/\sqrt{3}`. The resulting equation is `3y^3 - 3y^2 + (26/3)y - 8 = 0`. Next let it be required to replace this equation by another in which the known quantities are expressed only by whole numbers. Let `z = 3y`. Multiplying the coefficients by 1, 3, 9, and 27 respectively, we have

`z^3 - 3z^2 + 26z - 72 = 0`.

The roots of this equation are not 2, 3, and 4. However, if we consider the equation `z^3 - 9z^2 + 26z - 24 = 0`, its roots are 2, 3, and 4; and hence the roots of the preceding equation `y^3 - 3y^2 + (26/9)y - 8/9 = 0` are `2/3`, `1` and `4/3`, and those of the first equation `x^3 - \sqrt{3}x^2 + (26/9)x - (8\sqrt{3})/9 = 0` are `(2/3)\sqrt{3}`, `\sqrt{3}` and `(4/3)\sqrt{3}`.

This method can also be used to make the known quantity of any term equal to a given quantity. Thus, given the equation

`x^3 - b^2x + c^3 = 0`,

let it be required to write an equation in which the coefficient of the second term, namely `-b^2`, shall be replaced by `-3a^2`. Let `y = x(a\sqrt{3}/b)`, and we have

`y^3 - 3a^2y + c^3(3a^2/b^2)^(3/2) = 0`.

Neither the true nor the false roots are always real; sometimes they are imaginary; that is, while we can always conceive of as many roots for each equation as I have already assigned, yet there is not always a definite quantity corresponding to each root so conceived of. Thus, while we may conceive of the equation `x^3 - 6x^2 + 13x - 10 = 0` as having three roots, yet there is only one real root, 2, while the other two, however we may increase, diminish, or multiply them in accordance with the rules just laid down, remain always imaginary.

When the construction of a problem involves the solution of an equation in which the unknown quantity has three dimensions, the following steps must be taken:

First, if the equation contains some fractional coefficients, change them to whole numbers by the method explained above; if it contains surds, change them as far as possible into rational numbers, either by multiplication or by one of several other methods easy enough to find. Second, by

## THIRD BOOK 337

examining in order all the factors of the last term, determine whether the left member of the equation is divisible by a binomial consisting of the unknown quantity plus or minus any one of these factors. If it is, the problem is plane, that is, it can be constructed by means of the ruler and compasses; for either the known quantity of the binomial is the required root or else, having divided the left member of the equation by the binomial, the quotient is of the second degree, and from this quotient the root can be found as explained in the first book.

Given, for example, `y^3 - 8y^2 - 124y - 64 = 0`: the last term, -64, is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64; therefore, we must find whether the left member is divisible by `y + 2`, `y - 4`, and so on. We shall find that it is divisible by `y - 16` as follows:

```
        y^2 +  8y +   4
      _________________
y - 16 | y^3 -  8y^2 - 124y - 64
       -(y^3 - 16y^2)
       _________________
             8y^2 - 124y
           -(8y^2 - 128y)
           _________________
                   4y - 64
                 -(4y - 64)
                 ___________
                         0
```

Beginning with the last term, I divide -64 by -16 which gives +4; write this in the quotient; multiply +4 by `y - 16` which gives `4y - 64`, and write in the dividend `-4y + 64` (the opposite sign from that obtained by the multiplication must always be used). Adding `-124y` and `-4y` I have `-128y`. Dividing this by `-16` I have `+8y` in the quotient, and multiplying by `y - 16` I have `-8y^2 + 128y` to be added to the corresponding term, `-8y^2 - 124y`, in the dividend. This gives `8y^2 - 128y` which divided by `y - 16` yields `y^2` in the quotient and `y^3 - 16y^2` to be added to `y^3 - 8y^2` which gives zero, and shows that the division is finished.

If, however, there is a remainder, or if any modified term is not exactly divisible by `y - 16`, then it is clear that the binomial is not a divisor.

Similarly, given

`z^4 + ((1/2)a^2 - c^2)z^2 - (a^3 + ac^2)z + ((5/16)a^4 - (1/4)a^2c^2) = 0`,

the last term is divisible by `a`, `a^2`, `a^2 + c^2`, `a^3 + ac^2`, and so on, but only two of these need be considered, namely `a^2` and `c^2`. The others give a term in the quotient of lower or higher degree than the known quantity of the next to the last term, and thus render the division impossible. Note that I am here considering `z^4` as of the third degree, since there are no terms in `z^3`, `z^2`, or `z`. Trying the binomial

`z^2 - a^2 - c^2 = 0`

we find that the division can be performed as follows:

## GEOMETRY 338

This shows that `a^2 + c^2` is the required root, which can easily be proved by multiplication.

But when no binomial divisor of the proposed equation can be found, it is certain that the problem depending upon it is solid, and it is then as great a mistake to try to construct it by using only circles and straight lines as it is to use the conic sections to construct a problem requiring only circles; for any evidence of ignorance may be termed a mistake.

Again, given an equation in which the unknown quantity has four dimensions. After removing any surds or fractions, see if a binomial having one term a factor of the last term of the expression will divide the left member. If such a binomial can be found, either the known quantity of the binomial is the required root, or, after the division is performed, the resulting equation, which is of only three dimensions, must be treated in the same way. If no such binomial can be found, we must increase or diminish the roots so as to remove the second term, in the way already explained, and then reduce it to another of the third degree, in the following manner: Instead of

`x^4 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0`

write

`y^3 + 2qy^2 + (q^2 - 4s)y - r^2 = 0`.

For the ambiguous sign put `+2q` in the second expression if `+q` occurs in the first; but if `-q` occurs in the first, write `-2q` in the second; and on the contrary, put `-4s` if `+s`, and `+4s` if `-s` occurs; but whether the first expression contains `+r` or `-r` we always write `-r^2` and the second, provided that `x^4` and `q^2` have the sign `+`; otherwise, we write `+r^2` and `-q^2`. For example, given

`x^4 - 4x^2 - 8x + 35 = 0`

replace it by

`y^3 - 8y^2 - 124y - 64 = 0`.

For since `q = -4`, we replace `2qy^2` by `-8y^2`; and since `s = 35`, we replace `(q^2 - 4s)y` by `((-4)^2 - 4(35))y` or `(16 - 140)y = -124y`; and since `r = -8`, we replace `-r^2` by `-(-8)^2 = -64`.

Similarly, instead of

`x^4 - 17x^2 - 20x - 6 = 0`

we must write

`y^3 - 34y^2 + 313y - 400 = 0`,

for 34 is twice 17, and 313 is the square of 17 increased by four times 6, and 400 is the square of 20.

In the same way, instead of

`z^4 + ((1/2)a^2 - c^2)z^2 - (a^3 + ac^2)z + ((5/16)a^4 - (1/4)a^2c^2) = 0`,

we must write

`y^3 + (a^2 - 2c^2)y^2 + (c^4 - a^4)y - (a^3 + ac^2)^2 = 0`;

for

`q = (1/2)a^2 - c^2`, `(q^2 - 4s) = c^4 - a^4`, `r^2 = (a^3 + ac^2)^2`.

# THIRD BOOK

When the equation has been reduced to three dimensions, the value of y is found by the method already explained. If this cannot be done it is useless to pursue the question further, for it follows inevitably that the problem is solid. If, however, the value of y can be found, we can, by means of it, separate the preceding equation into two others, each of the second degree, whose roots will be the same as those of the original equation. Instead of

x^4 ± p x^3 ± q x^2 ± r x ± s = 0

write the two equations

x^2 ± y x + a x ± b = 0

and

x^2 ± y' x + c x ± d = 0.

For the ambiguous signs write + in each new equation when p has a positive sign, and − when p has a negative sign; but write + when we have − y x and − when we have + p x, provided q has a positive sign, and the opposite when q has a negative sign. It is then easy to determine all the roots of the proposed equation, and consequently to construct the problem of which it contains the solution, by the exclusive use of circles and straight lines.

For example, writing y^2 − 5y^1 + 51 y^2 − 400 = 0 instead of x^4 − 17 x^3 − 20 x − 6 = 0, we find that y = 10; then, instead of the original equation

x^4 − 17 x^2 − 20 x − 6 = 0

write the two equations

x^2 − 4 x − 3 = 0

and

x^2 + x^2 − 4 x + 2 = 0.

For, y/2 = 4, y/2 = 8, p = 17, q = 20, and therefore ...

(Obtaining the roots of these two equations, we get the same results as if we had obtained the roots of the equation containing x^4, namely, one true root, √7 + 2, and three false ones, √1 − 2y, 2 + √2, and 2 − ...)

Again, given

x^4 − 4 x^2 − 8 x + 35 = 0,

we have y^2 − 8 y^1 − 124 y^2 − 64 = 0, and since the root of the latter equation is 16, we must write x^4 − 4 x^2 + 5 = 0 and x^2 + 4 x − 7 = 0. For in this case ...

(Now these two equations have no roots either true or false, whence we know that the four roots of the original equation are imaginary; and that the problem whose solution depends upon this equation is plane, but that its construction is impossible, because the given quantities cannot be united.)

GEOMETRY

Similarly, given

z^6 + (a^2 − c^2) z^2 − (a^3 + a c^2) z + a^4 − a c^4 = 0,

since we have found y = a^2 + c^2 we must write

z^2 − √(a^2 + c^2) z + i a^2 − a √(a^2 + c^2) = 0

and

z^2 + √(a^2 + c^2) z + ... = 0.

For y = √(a^2 + c^2) and ... then we have

2 = i v a^2' + yj − i a^2 + l c^2 + ha √(a^2 + c^2)

or ...

Now we already have z + √a = x, and therefore x, the quantity in the search for which we have performed all these operations, is

x = ... + √a + √(i c^2) + ...

To emphasize the value of this rule, I shall apply it to a problem. Given the square AD and the line BN, to prolong the side AC to E, so that EF, laid off from E on EB, shall be equal to NB.

Pappus showed that if BD is produced to G so that DG = DN, and a circle is described on BG as diameter, the required point E will be the intersection of the straight line AC (produced) with the circumference of this circle.

Those not familiar with this construction would not be likely to discover it, and if they applied the method suggested here they would never think of taking DG for the unknown quantity rather than CF or FD, since either of these would much more easily lead to an equation. They would thus get an equation which could not easily be solved without the rule which I have just explained.

For, putting a for BD or CD, c for BF and x for DF, we have CF = a − x, and, since CF is to FD as FD is to BF, we have

(a − x) : c = x : BF,

whence BF = (a c) / x. Now, in the right triangle BDF whose sides are x and a, x^2 + a^2, the sum of their squares, is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, which is (x + a)^2. Multiplying both sides by ...

(x^2 − 2 a x^2 + 2 a^2 x^2 − 2 a^2 x + a^2 = c^2 x^2 y)

or

x^4 − 2 a x^3 + (2 a^2 − c^2) x^2 − 2 a^3 x + a^4 = 0,

and by the preceding rule we know that its root, which is the length of the line DF, is ...

If, on the other hand, we consider BF, CE, or BE as the unknown quantity, we obtain an equation of the fourth degree, but much easier to solve, and quite simply obtained.

Again, if DG were used, the equation would be much more difficult to obtain, but its solution would be very simple. I state this simply to warn you that, when the proposed problem is not solid, if one method of attack yields a very complicated equation, a much simpler one can usually be found by some other method.

I might add several different rules for the solution of cubic and biquadratic equations but they would be superfluous, since the construction of any plane problem can be found by means of those already given.

I could also add rules for equations of the fifth, sixth, and higher degrees, but I prefer to consider them all together and to state the following general rule:

First, try to put the given equation into the form of an equation of the same degree obtained by multiplying together two others, each of a lower degree. If, after all possible ways of doing this have been tried, none has been successful, then it is certain that the given equation cannot be reduced to a simpler one; and, consequently, if it is of the third or fourth degree, the problem depending upon it is solid; if of the fifth or sixth, the problem is one degree more complex, and so on. I have also omitted here the demonstration of most of my statements, because they seem to me so easy that if you take the trouble to examine them systematically the demonstrations will present themselves to you and it will be of much more value to you to learn them in that way than by reading them.

Now, when it is clear that the proposed problem is solid, whether the equation upon which its solution depends is of the fourth degree or only of the third, its roots can always be found by any one of the three conic sections, or even by some part of one of them, however small, together with only circles and straight lines. I shall content myself with giving here a general rule for finding them all by means of a parabola, since that is in some respects the simplest of these curves.

First, remove the second term of the proposed equation, if this is not already zero, thus reducing it to the form z^3 = ± a p z ± a^2 q if the given equation is of the third degree, or z^4 = ± a p z^2 ± a^2 q z ± a^3 r if it is of the fourth degree. By choosing a as the unit, the former may be written z^3 = ± p z ± q and the latter z^4 = ± p z^2 ± q z ± r. Suppose that the parabola FAG is already described; let ACDKL be its axis, a, or l which equals 2 AC, its latus rectum (C being within the parabola), and A its vertex. Lay off CD equal to p/2 so that the points D and A lie on the same side of C if the equation contains + p and on opposite sides if it contains − p. Then at the point D (or, if p = 0, at C), erect DE perpendicular to CD, so that DE is equal to q/2, and about E as center, with AE as radius, describe the circle FG, if the given equation is a cubic, that is, if r is zero.

If the equation contains + r, on one side of AE produced, lay off AR equal to r, and on the other side lay off AS equal to the latus rectum of the parabola, that is, to l, and describe a circle on RS as diameter. Then if AH is drawn perpendicular to AE it will

Fig. 34

meet the circle RHS in the point H, through which the other circle FHG must pass.

If the equation contains − r, construct a circle upon AE as diameter and in it inscribe AI, a line equal to AH; then the first circle must pass through the point I.

Now the circle FG can cut or touch the parabola in 1, 2, 3, or 4 points; and if perpendiculars are drawn from these points upon the axis they will represent all the roots of the equation, both true and false. If the quantity q is positive, the true roots will be those perpendiculars, such as FL, on the same side of the parabola as E, the center of the circle; while the others, as GK, will be the false roots. On the other hand, if q is negative, the true roots will be those on the opposite side, and the false or negative roots will be those on the same side as E, the center of the circle. If the circle neither cuts nor touches the parabola at any point, it is an indication that the equation has neither a true nor a false root, but that all the roots are imaginary.

This rule is evidently as general and complete as could possibly be desired. Its demonstration is also very easy. If the line GK thus constructed be represented by z, then AK is z + p, since by the nature of the parabola, GK is the mean proportional between AK and the latus rectum, which is 1. Then if AC or p and CD or ... be subtracted from AK, the remainder is DK or EM, which is equal to z/2, the square of which is

z^2 − p z + (p^2 + p + ...).

And since DE = KM = q/2, the whole line GM = 2 + ...; the square of GM equals z^2 + q z + q^2. Adding these two squares we have

...

for the square of GE, since GE is the hypotenuse of the right triangle E G M.

But GE is the radius of the circle EG and can therefore be expressed in another way. For since ED = q/2, and AD = p/2 and ADE is a right angle, we have

GE^2 = (p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 + ... .

Then, since HA is the mean proportional between AS or 1 and AR or r, HA = √r; and since EAH is a right angle, the square of HE or of EG is

HE^2 = 1 + r − 2 √r + ...

and we can form an equation from this expression and the one already obtained. This equation will be of the form ... and therefore the line GK, or z, is the root of this equation, which was to be proved. If you will apply this method in all the other cases, with the proper changes of sign, you will be convinced of its usefulness, without my writing anything further about it.

Let us apply it to the problem of finding two mean proportionals between the lines a and b. It is evident that if we represent one of the mean proportionals by z, then

a : z = z : y = y : b.

Thus we have an equation between b and z, namely, z^3 = a^2 b.

Describe the parabola FAG with its axis along AC, and with AC equal to 2 a, that is, to half the latus rectum. Then erect CD equal to b and perpendicular to AC at C, and describe the circle AF about E as center, passing through A. Then FL and LA are the required mean proportionals.

Again, let it be required to divide the angle NOP, or rather, the circular arc NQTP, into three equal parts. Let NO = 1 be the radius of the circle, NP = g be the chord subtending the given arc, and NQ = z be the chord subtending one-third of that arc; then the equation is z^3 = 3 z − q. For, drawing NQ, OQ and OT, and drawing QS parallel to TO, it is obvious that NO is to NQ as NQ is to QR as QR is to RS. Since NO = 1 and NQ = 2 z, then QR = 2 z^2 = ... and since NP or q lacks only RS or z^2 of being three times NQ or 2 z, we have q − 2 z − z^2 or z^2 = 2 z − q.

Describe the parabola FAG so that CA, one-half its latus rectum, shall be equal to 1/2; take CD = g/2 and the perpendicular DE = g/2; then describe the circle FAG about E as center, passing through A. This circle cuts the parabola in three points, F, G, and H, besides the vertex A. This shows that the given equation has three roots, namely, the two true roots, GK and gk, and one false root, FL. The smaller of the two roots, gk, must be taken as the length of the required line NQ, for the other root, GK, is equal to NV, the chord subtended by one-third the arc NVP, which, together with the arc NQP, constitutes the circle; and the false root, FL, is equal to the sum of QN and NV, as may easily be shown.

It is unnecessary for me to give other examples here, for all problems that are only solid can be reduced to such forms as not to require this rule for their construction except when they involve the finding of two mean proportionals or the trisection of an angle. This will be obvious if it is noted that the most difficult of these problems can be expressed by equations of the third or fourth degree; that all equations of the fourth degree can be reduced to quadratic equations by means of other equations not exceeding the third degree; and finally, that the second terms of these equations can be removed; so that every such equation can be reduced to one of the following forms:

z^3 = − p z + q

z^3 = + p z + q

z^3 = + p z − q.

346 GEOMETRY

Now, if we have z^3 = − p z + q, the rule, attributed by Cardan to one Scipio Ferreus, gives us the root

z = ∛(q/2 + √(q^2/4 − p^3/27)) + ∛(q/2 − √(q^2/4 − p^3/27)).

Similarly, when we have z^3 = + p z + q where the square of half the last term is greater than the cube of one-third the coefficient of the next to the last term, the corresponding rule gives us the root

z = ∛(−q/2 + √(q^2/4 + p^3/27)) + ∛(−q/2 − √(q^2/4 + p^3/27)).

It is now clear that all problems of which the equations can be reduced to either of these two forms can be constructed without the use of the conic sections except to extract the cube roots of certain known quantities, which process is equivalent to finding two mean proportionals between such a quantity and unity. Again, if we have z^3 = ... where the square of half the last term is not greater than the cube of one-third the coefficient of the next to the last term, describe the circle NQPV with radius NO equal to √(p/3), that is, to the mean proportional between unity and one-third the known quantity p. Then take NP = ... that is, such that NP is to g as 1 is to 3 p, and inscribe NP in the circle. Divide each of the two arcs NQP and NVP into three equal parts, and the required root is the sum of NQ, the chord subtending one-third the first arc, and NV, the chord subtending one-third of the second arc.

Finally, suppose that we have z^3 − p z − q. Construct the circle NQPV whose radius NO is equal to √(p/3), and let NP, equal to ... be inscribed in this circle; then NQ, the chord of one-third the arc NQP, will be the first of the required roots, and NV, the chord of one-third the other arc, will be the second.

An exception must be made in the case in which the square of half the last term is greater than the cube of one-third the coefficient of the next to the last term; for then the line NP cannot be inscribed in the circle, since it is longer than the diameter. In this case, the two roots that were true are merely imaginary, and the only real root is the one previously false, which according to Cardan’s rule is

z = ∛(q/2 + √(q^2/4 + p^3/27)) + ∛(q/2 − √(q^2/4 + p^3/27)).

Furthermore, it should be remarked that this method of expressing the roots by means of the relations which they bear to the sides of certain cubes whose contents only are known is in no respect clearer or simpler than the method of expressing them by means of the relations which they bear to the chords of certain arcs (or portions of circles), when arcs three times as long are known. And the roots of the cubic equations which cannot be solved by Cardan’s method can be expressed as clearly as any others, or more clearly than the others, by the method given here.

For example, grant that we may consider a root of the equation z^3 = − q z + p known, because we know that it is the sum of two lines of which one is the side of a cube whose volume is q/2 increased by the side of a square whose area is q^2/4 − r p^2, and the other is the side of another cube whose volume is the difference between q/2 and the side of a square whose area is ...

This is as much knowledge of the roots as is furnished by Cardan’s method. There is no doubt that the value of the root of the equation z^3 = + q z − p is quite as well known and as clearly conceived when it is considered as the length of a chord inscribed in a circle of radius √(p/3) and subtending an arc that is one-third the arc subtended by a chord of length ...

Indeed, these terms are much less complicated than the others, and they might be made even more concise by the use of some particular symbol to express such chords, just as the symbol ∛ is used to represent the side of a cube.

By methods similar to those already explained, we can express the roots of any biquadratic equation, and there seems to me nothing further to be desired in the matter; for by their very nature these roots cannot be expressed in simpler terms, nor can they be determined by any construction that is at the same time easier and more general.

It is true that I have not yet stated my grounds for daring to declare a thing possible or impossible, but if it is remembered that in the method I use all problems which present themselves to geometers reduce to a single type, namely, to the question of finding the values of the roots of an equation, it will be clear that a list can be made of all the ways of finding the roots, and that it will then be easy to prove our method the simplest and most general. Solid problems in particular cannot, as I have already said, be constructed without the use of a curve more complex than the circle. This follows at once from the fact that they all reduce to two constructions, namely, to one in which two mean proportionals are to be found between two given lines, and one in which two points are to be found which divide a given arc into three equal parts. Inasmuch as the curvature of a circle depends only upon a simple relation between the center and all points on the circumference, the circle can only be used to determine a single point between two extremes, as, for example, to find one mean proportional between two given lines or to bisect a given arc; while, on the other hand, since the curvature of the conic sections always depends upon two different things, it can be used to determine two different points.

For a similar reason, it is impossible that any problem of degree more complex than the solid, involving the finding of four mean proportionals or the division of an angle into five equal parts, can be constructed by the use of one of the conic sections.

I therefore believe that I shall have accomplished all that is possible when I have given a general rule for constructing problems by means of the curve described by the intersection of a parabola and a straight line, as previously explained; for I am convinced that there is nothing of a simpler nature that will serve this purpose. You have seen, too, that this curve directly follows the conic sections in that question to which the ancients devoted so much attention, and whose solution presents in order all the curves that should be received into geometry.

When quantities required for the construction of these problems are to be found, you already know how an equation can always be formed that is of no higher degree than the fifth or sixth. You also know how by increasing the roots of this equation we can make them all true, and at the same time have the coefficient of the third term greater than the square of half that of the second term. Also, if it is not higher than the fifth degree it can always be changed into an equation of the sixth degree in which every term is present.

Now to overcome all these difficulties by means of a single rule, I shall consider all these directions applied and the equation thereby reduced to the form:

y^6 − v y^5 + q y^4 − r y^3 + s y^2 − t y + u = 0

in which q is greater than the square of ...

Produce BK indefinitely in both directions, and at B draw AB perpendicular to BK and equal to √p. In a separate plane describe the parabola CDF whose principal parameter is n, which we shall represent by n.

Now place the plane containing the parabola on that containing the lines AB and BK, in such a way that the axis DE of the parabola falls along the line BK. Take a point E such that DE = n/2 and place a ruler so as to connect this point E and the point A of the lower plane. Hold the ruler so that it always connects these points, and slide the parabola up or down, keeping its axis always along BK. Then the point C, the intersection of the parabola and the ruler, will describe the curve ACN, which is to be used in the construction of the proposed problem.

Having thus described the curve, take a point L in the line BK on the concave side of the parabola, and such that BL = DE = n/2; then lay off on BK, toward B, LH equal to 2 n √(u) / v; from H draw HI perpendicular to LH and on the same side as the curve ACN. Take HI equal to (s + p^2 / u) / 2, which we may, for the sake of brevity, set equal to m. Join L and I, and describe the circle LPI on LI as diameter; then inscribe in this circle the line LP equal to (s + p^2 / u) / ... . Finally, describe the circle PCN about I as center and passing through P. This circle will cut or touch the curve ACN in as many points as the equation has roots; and hence the perpendiculars CG, NR, QO, and so on, dropped from these points upon BK, will be the required roots. This rule never fails, nor does it admit of any exceptions.

For, if the quantity s were so large in proportion to the others, p, q, r, t, u, that the line LP was greater than the diameter of the circle LI, so that LP could not be inscribed in it, every root of the proposed equation would be imaginary; and the same would be true if the circle IP were so small that it did not cut the curve ACN at any point. The circle IP will in general cut the curve ACN in six different points, so that the equation can have six distinct roots. But if it cuts it in fewer points, this indicates that some of the roots are equal or else imaginary.

If, however, this method of tracing the curve ACN by the translation of a parabola seems to you awkward, there are many other ways of describing it. We might take AB and BL as before, and BK equal to the latus rectum of the parabola, and describe the semi-circle KST with its center in BK and cutting AB in some point S. Then from the point T where it ends, take TV toward K equal to BL and join S and V. Draw AC through A parallel to SV, and draw SC through S parallel to BK; then C, the intersection of AC and SC, will be one point of the required curve. In this way we can find as many points of the curve as may be desired.

The demonstration of all this is very simple. Place the ruler AE and the parabola FD so that both pass through the point C. This can always be done, since C lies on the curve generated by the intersection of the parabola and the ruler.

If we let CG = y, GD will equal n / y, since the latus rectum n is to CG as CG is to GD. Then DE = n / 2, and subtracting DE from GD we have GE = n / y − n / 2. Since AB is to BE as CG is to GE, and AB is equal to √p, therefore BE = √p · (GE / CG). Now let C be a point on the curve generated by the intersection of the line SC, which is parallel to BK, and AC, which is parallel to SV. Let SB = CG = y, and BK = n, the latus rectum of the parabola. Then BT = n / 2, for KB is to BS as BS is to BT, and since TV = BL = 2 n √(u) / v we have BV = ... Also, SB is to BV as AB is to BE, whence BE = ... as before. It is evident, therefore, that one and the same curve is described by these two methods.

Furthermore, BL = DE, and therefore DL = BE; also LH = 2 n √(u) / v, therefore ...

Also, since GD = n / y,

GH = DH − GD + ... + ...,

which may be written

GH = √(y^2 + i p y^2 + ... − V m)

and the square of GH is equal to

y^2 − v y^2 + ... + ... + u,

whatever point of the curve is taken as C, whether toward N or toward Q, it will always be possible to express the square of the segment of BH between the point H and the foot of the perpendicular from C to BH in these same terms connected by these same signs.

Again,

IH = m, LH = 2 n √(u) / v,

since the angle IHL is a right angle; and since

LP = √(...)

and the angle IPL is a right angle,

IC^2 = ...

Now draw CM perpendicular to IH, and

IM = HI − HM = HI − CG = m − y

whence the square of IM is

m^2 − 2 m y + y^2.

Taking this from the square of IC there remains the square of CM, or

CM^2 = IC^2 − IM^2 = ...,

and this is equal to the square of GH, previously found. This may be written

...

Now, putting

n^2 y^3 − v y^2 + i p y^2

for n^2 y^4, and

r y^3 + 2 m y^2 + 2 ... y^2

for 2 m y^3 and multiplying both members by n h j^2, we have

y^6 − p y^5 + i l p^4 + ... + 2 V (...) + (...) y^2 + (e − s − r) V u) y^1

equals

(i p^2 − q − ... y^2 + ... ) y^4 + (...) y^3 + (e − s − r) V u y^2

or

y^6 − p y^5 + q y^4 − r y^3 + s y^2 − t y + u = 0,

whence it appears that the lines CG, NR, QO, etc., are the roots of this equation.

If then it be desired to find four mean proportionals between the lines a and b, if we let x be the first, the equation is x^8 − a^8 = 0 or x^4 − a^4 x = 0. Let y = a + X and we get

y^4 − 6 a y^3 + 15 a^2 y^2 − 20 a^3 y + 15 a^4 − (6 a^4 + a^b) y + a^4 + a^b = 0.

Therefore, we must take AB = 3 a, and BK, the latus rectum of the parabola, must be

n = √(a^2 + a b),

which I shall call n, and DE or BL will be

2 a + 6 a^2 / ...

Then, having described the curve ACN, we must have

LI = [ (5 a^4 + n − b) / 2 n √(a^2 + a b) ] and

...,

and

LP = √(15 a^2 + Gn √(...)).

For the circle about I as center will pass through the point P thus found, and cut the curve in the two points C and N. If we draw the perpendiculars NR and CG, and subtract NR, the smaller, from CG, the greater, the remainder will be X, the first of the four required mean proportionals.

This method applies as well to the division of an angle into five equal parts, the inscription of a regular polygon of eleven or thirteen sides in a circle, and an infinity of other problems. It should be remarked, however, that in many of these problems it may happen that the circle cuts the parabola of the second class so obliquely that it is hard to determine the exact point of intersection. In such cases this construction is not of practical value. The difficulty could easily be overcome by forming other rules analogous to these, which might be done in a thousand different ways.

But it is not my purpose to write a large book. I am trying rather to include much in a few words, as will perhaps be inferred from what I have done, if it is considered that, while reducing to a single construction all the problems of one class, I have at the same time given a method of transforming them into an infinity of others, and thus of solving each in an infinite number of ways; that, furthermore, having constructed all plane problems by the cutting of a circle by a straight line, and all solid problems by the cutting of a circle by a parabola; and, finally, all that are but one degree ...

more complex by cutting a circle by a curve but one degree higher than the parabola, it is only necessary to follow the same general method to construct all problems, more and more complex, *ad infinitum*; for in the case of a mathematical progression, whenever the first two or three terms are given, it is easy to find the rest.

I hope that posterity will judge me kindly, not only as to the things which I have explained, but also as to those which I have intentionally omitted so as to leave to others the pleasure of discovery.

# SPINOZA

## BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
**Benedict de Spinoza, 1632-1677**

Benedict (Baruch) de Spinoza was born in Amsterdam on the 24th of November, 1632, the son of a Jewish family which had emigrated from Portugal in the last decade of the sixteenth century to have the benefit of Dutch religious toleration. His father seems to have been of some prominence in the local Jewish community, and young Baruch was presumably educated in the Jewish schools. Whatever may be the value of the various reports as to the course of his education, there can be no doubt that he early acquired unorthodox opinions, for in July, 1656, after some controversy, the details of which are far from clear, he was solemnly excommunicated by the Jewish authorities for “abominable heresies which he practises and teaches.” Cut off from his own people, his parents dead, Spinoza was thrown on his own resources.

The next four years Spinoza spent in or near Amsterdam, associating with members of the Collegiant, Mennonite, and Remonstrant sects, and devoting himself to the study of Latin, Greek, and other “humane sciences.” Probably it was also during these years that he acquired or at least perfected the trade of lens-grinder, which provided him with a means of support throughout the rest of his life. Leaving Amsterdam in 1660, he retired to Rijnsburg, a small village near Leyden and headquarters of the Collegiant group, where, according to his first biographer, “removed from all the obstacles which he could only overcome by flight, he devoted himself entirely to philosophy.”

During his three years at Rijnsburg Spinoza wrote the *Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-Being*, the *Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding*, *Descartes’ Principles of Philosophy Geometrically Demonstrated* with appended *Metaphysical Thoughts*, and seems to have begun work on what eventually became the *Ethics*. The exposition of *Descartes’ Principles* was undertaken for the instruction of a group of students, who had formed a sort of philosophical club in Amsterdam, and it was far from representing Spinoza’s own views, as, indeed, the preface to the published work stated. Spinoza allowed it to be published, however, hoping that “perhaps on this occasion there will be found some who hold the first places in my country, who will desire to see the other things which I have written and which I acknowledge as my own, and they will make it their business that I should be able to publish them without any risk of trouble.”

His reputation was already growing. He had been visited by and was corresponding with Henry Oldenburg, one of the first two secretaries of the Royal Society of London, and through him with Robert Boyle; through the years he became acquainted with numerous other prominent personages of both the political and intellectual worlds, among them Christian Huygens. Possibly in order to be closer to some of these friends, he moved to Voorburg, near The Hague, in 1663. Although the publication of his version of Descartes aroused considerable interest, it did not produce the consequences he had desired, since publication of his other works did not follow. While continuing to work on the *Ethics*, he began, in 1665, the composition of the *Theological-Political Treatise*, which was published anonymously in 1670. Spinoza was moved to write this book partly by a desire to assert “the liberty of philosophizing and of saying what we think,” which “cannot be destroyed unless the peace and piety of the state is therewith also destroyed.”

Condemnations of the *Treatise* immediately flew thick and fast, and in many Spinoza’s name was mentioned. In the disorders consequent upon the French invasion of 1672, Jan de Witt, former Grand Pensionary of Holland and powerful friend and protector of Spinoza, was murdered by an angry mob. Spinoza, whose *Theological-Political Treatise* had been denounced as “forged in hell by a renegade Jew and the devil, and issued with the knowledge of Mr. Jan de Witt,” was so aroused by this event that he was with difficulty restrained from public denunciation of the murderers. The Prince of Condé, commanding the French Army at Utrecht, invited Spinoza to visit him, and Spinoza went, but with what motives this visit was requested or why paid is far from certain. In any case the effort was wasted, for Condé had been called away, and Spinoza returned to The Hague, where he found himself an object of popular suspicion. The same year, 1673, he was offered a professorship at the University of Heidelberg, but he gracefully declined, declaring that he held back, “not in the hope of some better fortune, but from love of tranquillity, which I believe I can obtain in some measure by refraining from public lectures.”

The remainder of his life was spent quietly at The Hague, where he had settled in 1670. He completed his *Ethics* and sought to publish it, but was discouraged by the complaints aroused by the mere rumor of its being on the press. Subsequently he began his *Political Treatise*, which remained unfinished, and planned a Hebrew grammar. In 1676, already seriously ill with the consumption which was to kill him, he received a visit from Leibnitz, with whom he had already corresponded on problems of optics, and they conversed “often and at great length.” Four months later, on a quiet Sunday afternoon in February, 1677, while the “people of the house” were at church, he died in the presence of an Amsterdam physician-friend. His funeral was “attended by many illustrious personages and followed by six coaches.” He was forty-four. He left a small library, his clothes, a little furniture, some finished lenses (which “sold pretty dear”), and his manuscripts, which were published the same year by his friends.
