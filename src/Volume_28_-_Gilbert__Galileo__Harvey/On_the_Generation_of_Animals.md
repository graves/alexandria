## On the Generation of Animals, ii. 4.

is very different from this; for neither does the semen, or rather the “*geniture*,” proceeding from the male in the act of intercourse, enter the uterus in any way, nor has the hen, after she conceives, any particle of excrementitious matter, even of the purest kind, or any blood in her uterus which might be fashioned or perfected by the discharge of the male. Neither are the parts of the egg, the membranes, to wit, and the fluids, produced by any kind of coagulation; neither is there anything like curdled milk to be discovered in the uterus, as must be obvious from the foregoing exercises. It follows, therefore, and from thence, that neither does the conception, whence the animal springs, as the herb arises from a fruitful seed, comport itself in the manner Aristotle imagined, since this takes place in viviparous animals in the same way as the egg is formed in oviparous animals, as he himself avows, and as shall be demonstrated by and by in our observations. Because it is certain that eggs of every description—prolific and barren—are engendered and formed by the hen singly, but that fecundity accrues from the male alone; the cock, I say, contributes neither form nor matter to the egg, but that only by which it becomes fertile and fit to engender a chick. And this faculty the cock confers by his semen (*genitura*), emitted in the act of intercourse, not only on the egg that is already begun, or is already formed, but on the uterus and ovary, and even on the body of the fowl herself, in such wise that eggs which have yet to be produced, eggs, none of the matter of which yet exists either in the ovary or in any other part of the body, are thence produced possessed of fecundity.

### EXERCISE 32. Nor in the manner imagined by physicians

Conception, according to the opinion of medical men, takes place in the following way: during intercourse the male and female dissolve in one voluptuous sensation, and eject their seminal fluids (*geniturae*) into the cavity of the uterus, where that which each contributes is mingled with that which the other supplies, the mixture having from both equally the faculty of action and the force of matter; and according to the predominance of this or of that *geniture* does the progeny turn out male or female. It is further imagined that immediately after the intercourse, the active and passive principles cooperating, something of the conception is formed in the uterus. For contrary to the Aristotelians, they maintain that the male is no more the efficient cause of generation than the female, but some mixture of the two; and that neither the menstrual blood nor its purest part is the prime matter of the conception, but the spermatic fluid; whence the first particles or their rudiments are spoken of as spermatic, these at an after period being nourished and made to increase through the blood.

But it is obvious that neither is the egg engendered by the cock and hen in this way; for the hen in the act of intercourse emits no semen from which an egg might be formed; nor can aught like a seminal fluid of the hen be demonstrated at any time; and indeed the animal is destitute of the organs essential to its preparation, the testes and *vasa spermatica*. And though the hen have an effective force in common with the cock (as must be manifest from what precedes), and it is a mixture of some sort that renders an egg fruitful, still this does not happen according to the predominance of the *genitures*, or the manner of their mixture, for it is certain, and Fabricius admits it, that the semen of the cock does not reach the cavity of the uterus; neither is there any trace of the egg to be discovered in the uterus immediately after intercourse, and as its consequence, although Aristotle himself repeatedly avers that there is, asserting that “something of the conception forthwith ensues.” But I shall by and by demonstrate that neither does any such imaginary mixture of seminal fluids take place in any animal, nor that immediately upon intercourse, even of a fruitful kind, is there anything in the shape of semen or blood, or of the rudiments of an embryo present or demonstrable in the cavity of the uterus. Nothing is found in the egg or embryo which leads us to suppose that the semen *masculinum* is either there contained or mingled. The vulgar notion of the *chalazae* being the tread of the cock is a sheer mistake; and I am surprised, since there are two of them, one in either end of the egg, that no one has yet been found to maintain that this was the cock's seed, that the hen's. But this popular error is at once answered by the fact that the *chalazae* are present with the same characters in every egg, whether it be fertile or barren.

### EXERCISE 33. The male and the female are alike efficient in the business of generation

The medical writers with propriety maintain, in opposition to the Aristotelians, that both sexes have the power of acting as efficient causes in the business of generation; inasmuch as the being engendered is a mixture of the two which engender: both form and likeness of body, and species are mixed, as we see in the hybrid between the partridge and common fowl. And it does indeed seem consonant with reason to hold that they are the efficient causes of conception whose mixture appears in the thing produced.

Aristotle entertaining this opinion says:
> “In some animals it is manifest that such as the generator is, such is the engendered; not, however, the same and identical, not one numerically, but one specifically, as in natural things. A man engenders a man, if there be nothing preternatural in the way, as a horse engenders a mule, and other similar instances. For the mule is common to the horse and the ass; it is not spoken of as an allied kind; yet may horse and ass both be there conjoined in a hybrid state.”¹
He says further in the same place:
> “It is enough that the generator generate, and prove the cause that the species be found in the matter: for such and such an entire species is still found associated with such and such flesh and bones—here it is Callias, there it is Socrates.”

Wherefore if such an entire form, as a mule, be a mixture of two, viz., a horse and an ass, the horse does not suffice to produce this form of a mule in the “matter”; but, as the entire form is mixed, so another efficient cause is contributed by the ass and added to that supplied by the horse. That, therefore, which produces a mule compounded of two, must itself be an “adequate efficient,” and mixed, if only “univocal.” For example, this woman and that man engender this Socrates; not in so far as they are both human beings, and of one and the same species, but in so far as this man and that woman in these bones and muscles constitute human forms, of both of which, if Socrates be a certain mixture, a compound of both, that by which he is made must needs be a mixed univocal compound of the two; i. e., a mixed efficient of a mixed effect. And, therefore, it is that the male and female by themselves, and separately, are not genetic, but become so united in *coitu* and made one animal, as it were; whence, from the two as one, is produced and educed that which is the true efficient proximate cause of conception.

The medical writers also, in directing their attention to the particulars of human generation alone, come to conclusions on generation at large; and the spermatic fluid proceeding from the parents in *coitu* has in all probability been taken by them for true seed, analogous to the seeds of plants. It is not without reason, therefore, that they imagine the mixed efficient cause of the future offspring to be constituted by a mixture of the seminal matters of each parent. And then they go on to assert that the mixture proceeding immediately from intercourse is deposited in the uterus and forms the rudiments of the conception. That things are very different, however, is made manifest by our preceding history of the egg, which is a true conception.

### EXERCISE 34. Of the matter of the egg, in opposition to the Aristotelians and the medical writers

The position taken up by the medical writers against the Aristotelians, viz., that the blood is not the first element in a conception, is clearly shown from the generation of the egg to be well chosen: neither during intercourse, nor before nor after it, is there a drop of blood contained in the uterus of the fowl; neither are the rudiments of eggs red, but white. Many animals also conceive in whose uteri, if they be suddenly laid open after intercourse, no blood can be demonstrated.

But when they contend that the maternal blood is the food of the foetus in utero, especially of its more sanguineous parts, as they style them, and that the foetus from the outset is as it were a portion of the mother, being nourished and growing through her blood, and vegetating through her spirit; so that neither does the heart pulsate, nor the liver compose blood, nor any part of the foetus perform any kind of independent office, but everything is carried on through the mother’s means, they in their turn are as certainly mistaken, and argue from erroneous observations. For the embryo in the egg boasts of its own blood, formed from the fluids contained within the egg; and its heart is seen to pulsate from the very beginning: it borrows nothing in the shape either of blood or spirits from the hen, for the purpose of forming its so-called sanguineous parts and its feathers; as most clearly appears to anyone who looks on with an unbiassed mind. From observations afterwards to be communicated, I believe indeed that it will be held as sufficiently proven that even the foetus of viviparous animals still contained in the uterus is not nourished by the blood of the mother and does not vegetate through her spirit; but boasts of its own peculiar vital principle and powers, and its own blood, like the chick *in ovo*.

With reference to the matter which the embryo obtains from its male and female parent, however, and the way and manner of generation as commonly discoursed of in the schools, viz., that conception is produced or becomes prolific from mixture of the *genitures* and their mutual action and passion, as also of the seminal fluid of the female, and the parts which are spoken of as sanguineous and spermatic, numerous and striking observations afterwards to be related have compelled me to adopt opinions at variance with all such views. At this time I shall only say that I am greatly surprised how physicians, particularly those among them who are conversant with anatomy, should pretend to support their opinions by means of two arguments especially, which rightly understood, seem rather to prove the opposite; viz., from the shock and resolution of the forces and the effusion of fluid which women at the moment of the sexual orgasm frequently experience, they argue that all women pour out a seminal fluid, and that this is necessary to generation.

But passing over the fact that the females of all the lower animals, and all women, do not experience any such emission of fluid, and that conception is nowise impossible in cases where it does not take place, for I have known several, who without anything of the kind were sufficiently prolific, and even some who after experiencing such an emission and having had great enjoyment, nevertheless appeared to have lost somewhat of their wonted fecundity; and then an infinite number of instances might be quoted of women who, although they have great satisfaction in intercourse, still emit nothing, and yet conceive; passing over these facts, I say, I cannot but express surprise at those especially, who, conceiving such an emission on the part of the female necessary to conception, have not adverted to the fact that the fluid emitted is discharged, cast out, and is particularly abundant about the clitoris and orifice of the vulva; that it is seldom poured out within the vulva, never within the uterus, and so as to be mingled with the semen of the male; moreover, it is of a mere serous or ichorous consistency, like urine, by no means thick and apparently unctuous, like the spermatic matter of the male. But how shall we suppose that to be of use internally which is discharged externally? Or shall we say that this humour, as if bidding the uterus farewell, is taken to the verge of the vulva, that it may be then recalled with greater favour by the uterus?

The other argument is drawn from the genital organs of women, the testes, to wit, and *vasa spermatica, praeparantia et deferentia*, which are held to serve for the preparation of the spermatic fluid. I, for my part, greatly wonder how anyone can believe that from parts so imperfect and obscure a fluid like the semen, so elaborate, concoct and vivifying, can ever be produced, endowed with force and spirit and generative influence adequate to overcome that of the male; for this is implied in the discussion concerning the predominance of the male or the female, as to which of them is to become the agent and efficient cause, which the matter and pathic principle. How should such a fluid get the better of another concocted under the influence of a heat so fostering, of vessels so elaborate, and endowed with such vital energy?—how should such a fluid as the male semen be made to play the part of mere matter.—But of these things more hereafter.

Meantime, it is certain that the egg of the hen is not engendered from any such discharge of fluid during sexual intercourse, although after connexion, and brimful of satisfaction, she shakes herself for joy, and, as if already possessed of the richest treasure, as if gifted by supreme Jove, the preserver, with the blessing of fecundity, she sets to work to prune and ornament herself. The pigeon, particularly that kind which comes to us from Africa, expresses the satisfaction she feels from intercourse in a remarkable manner; she leaps, spreads her tail, and sweeps the ground with its extremity, she pecks and prunes her feathers—all her actions are as if she felt raised to the summit of felicity by the gift of fruitfulness.

We have said that the primary matter of the egg does not consist of blood as Aristotle would have it, neither does it proceed from any mixture of the male and female seminal fluids. Whence it truly originates we have already stated in part in our history; and we shall by and by have occasion to speak of the subject more at length when we come to treat generally of the matter from which every conception is originally produced.

### EXERCISE 35. In how far is the fowl efficient in the generation of the egg, according to Aristotle? And wherefore is the concurrence of the male required?

It has been already stated that the cock and hen are the two principles in the generation of the egg, although of the manner in which they are so I am of a different opinion from Aristotle and medical authorities. From the production of the egg we have clearly shown that the female as well as the male was efficient, and that she had within her a principle whence motion and the faculty of forming flowed; although in the sexual act the male neither confers the matter, nor does the female eject any semen whence the egg is constituted. It is consequently manifest, in some animals at least, that nature has not, on account of the distinction into male and female, established it as a law that the one, as agent, should confer form, the other, as passive, supply matter, as Aristotle apprehended; nor yet that during intercourse each should contribute a seminal fluid, by the mixture of which a conception or ovum should be produced, as physicians commonly suppose.

Now since everything that has been delivered by the ancients on generation is comprehended in these two opinions, it appears to have escaped every one up to this time, first, why the hen by herself does not generate, like vegetables, but requires a male to be associated with her in the work; and then how the conception or ovum is procreated by the male and the female together, or what either of them contributes to the process, and for what end intercourse was established.

Aristotle, in opposition to the entire tenor of his hypothesis, viz., that the male is to be regarded as the agent, the female as supplying the matter only, when he sees that eggs are actually produced by hens without the concurrence of the male, is compelled to admit that the female is likewise efficient; he was further not ignorant of the fact that an egg even when extruded could preserve itself, nourish itself, increase in size and produce an embryo, as happens with the eggs of fishes; and he has besides accorded a vital principle to an egg, even to a hypenemic one. But he endeavours to explain to what extent a female is efficient, and how a hypenemic egg is endowed with a vital principle, in the passage where he says:
> “Hypenemic eggs admit of generation to a certain point; for that they can ever go the length of producing an animal is impossible, this being the work of the senses. But females and all things that live, as already repeatedly stated, possess the vegetative soul. Wherefore the hypenemic egg as a vegetable is perfect, but as an animal it is imperfect.”²
By this he seems to insinuate that the hypenemic egg is possessed of a vegetative soul, inasmuch as this is inherent in all things that live, and an egg is alive. In like manner he ascribes to the hen the power of creating and of conferring the vegetative soul; because all females acquire this virtue, so that a hypenemic egg in so far as it lives as a vegetable is perfect, in so far as it is an animal, however, it is imperfect. As if a male were not required that a conception or ovum should be produced, and produced perfect; but that from this ovum an animal should be engendered. Not, I say, that an egg be produced as perfect in all respects as is the conception of a vegetable; but that it should be imbued with the animal principle. The egg, consequently, is formed by the hen, but it is made prolific by the cock.

Aristotle adds in the same place:
> “There is a distinction of sexes through the whole class of birds. And, therefore, it happens that the hen perfects her egg, not yet influenced by the intercourse of the male, in so far as it is a plant; but as it is not a plant, there she does not perfect it: nor does anything come of it which engenders. For neither has it arisen simply, like the seed of a plant, nor like an animal conception, by intercourse.”
He is here speaking of the wind egg; by and by he adds:
> “But those eggs that are conceived through intercourse are already characterized in a portion of the albumen: such eggs become fruitful through the male which first copulated, for they are then supplied with both principles.”

By this he seems to confess that the female is also effective in the work of generation, or is possessed of the faculty of engendering; because in every female there inheres a vegetative soul, whose faculty it is to engender. And, therefore, when he is speaking of the differences between the male and female, he still acknowledges both as generative; for he says: “We call that animal male which engenders in another, female that which engenders in itself.” From his own showing, therefore, both engender; and as there is a vegetative soul inherent in both, so is there also its faculty of generation. But how they differ has already been shown in the history of the egg: the hen generates of herself without the concurrence of the cock, as a plant out of itself produces fruit; but it is a wind egg that is thus produced: it is not made fruitful without the concurrence of the cock either preceding or succeeding. The female generates, then, but it is only up to a certain mark, and the concurrence of the male is requisite that this faculty of engendering be made complete, that she may not only lay an egg, but such an egg as will, under favorable circumstances, produce a pullet. The male appears to be ordained by nature to supply this deficiency in the generative powers of the female, as will be clearly shown by and by, and that that which the female of herself cannot accomplish, viz., the production of a fruitful egg, may be supplied and made good by the act of the male, who imparts this virtue to the fowl or the egg.

### EXERCISE 36. The perfect hen's egg is of two colours

Every egg, then, is not perfect; but some are to be held imperfect because they have not yet attained their true dimensions, which they only receive when extruded; others are imperfect because they are yet unprolific, and only acquire a fertilizing faculty from without, such are the eggs of fishes. Other eggs again are held imperfect by Aristotle, because they are of one colour only, inasmuch as perfect eggs consist of yelk and albumen, and are of two colours, as if better concocted, more distinct in their parts, endowed with higher heat. The eggs that are called centenine or hundredth eggs, and which Fabricius³ will have it are engendered of certain remainders of albumen, are of one colour only, and by reason of their deficiency of heat and their weakness, are regarded as imperfect. Of all eggs, there are none more perfect than those of the hen, which are produced complete in all their fluids and appendages, of proper size and fruitful.

Aristotle assigns the following reason wherefore some eggs are of two colours, others of one hue only:
> “In the hotter animals those things from which the principles of their origin are derived are distinct and separate from those which furnish their nutrition; now the one of these is white, the other is yellow.”⁴
As if the chick derived its origin from the albumen and was nourished by the *vitellus* alone. In the same place he proceeds thus:
> “That part which is hot contributes properly to the form in the constitution of the extremities; but the part that is more earthy, and is farther removed, supplies material for the trunk. Whence in eggs of two colours the animal derives its origin from the white, for the commencement of animal existence is in the white; but the nourishment is obtained from the yellow.”
He consequently thinks that this is the reason why these fluids are distinct, and why eggs are produced of two colours.

Now these ideas are partly true, partly false. It is not true, for instance, that the embryo of the common fowl is first formed from the albumen and then nourished by the *vitellus*; for, from the history of the formation of the chick *in ovo*, from the course of the umbilical vessels and the distribution of their branches, which undoubtedly serve for obtaining nourishment, it obviously appears that the constituent matter, and the nutriment are supplied to the chick from its first formation by the yelk, as well as the white; the fluid which we have called the *colliquament* seems further to be supplied, not less by the *vitellus* than the albumen; a certain portion of both the fluids seems, in fact, to be resolved. And then the spot, by the expansion of which the *colliquament* is formed in the first instance, and which we have called the eye, appears to be impressed upon the membrane of the *vitellus*.

The distinction into yellow and white, however, seems to be a thing necessary: these matters, as they are undoubtedly of different natures, appear also to serve different offices; they are, therefore, completely separate in the perfect egg, one of them being more, the other less, immediately akin to proper alimentary matter; by the one the foetus is nourished from the very beginning, by the other it is nourished at a later period. For it is certain, as Fabricius asserts, and as we afterwards maintain, that both of them are truly nutritious, the albumen as well as the *vitellus*, the albumen being the first that is consumed. I, therefore, agree with Aristotle against the physicians, that the albumen is the purer portion of the egg, the better concocted, the more highly elaborated; and, therefore, whilst the egg is getting perfected in the uterus, is the albumen as the hotter portion poured around in the circumference, the yelk or more earthy portion subsiding to the centre. For the albumen appears to contain the larger quantity of animal heat, and so to be nutriment of a more immediate kind. For like reasons it is probable that the albumen is purer and better concocted externally than it is internally.

When medical writers affirm that the yelk is the hotter and more nutritious portion of the egg, this I imagine is meant as it affords food to us, not as it is found to supply the wants of the chick *in ovo*. This, indeed, is obvious from the history of the formation of the chick, by which the thin albumen is absorbed and used up sooner than the thick, as if it formed the more appropriate aliment, and were more readily transmuted into the substance of the embryo, of the chick that is to be. The yelk, therefore, appears to be a more distant or ultimate aliment than the albumen, the whole of which has been used up before any notable portion of the *vitellus* is consumed. The yelk, indeed, is still found inclosed within the abdomen of the chick after its exclusion from the shell, as if it were destined to serve the new being in lieu of milk for its sustenance.

Eggs, consisting of white and yellow, are, therefore, more perfect, as more distinct in constitution, and elaborated by a higher temperature. For in the egg there must be included not only the matter of the chick but also its first nutriment; and what is provided for a perfect animal, must, itself, be perfect and highly elaborated; as that is, in fact, which consists of different parts, some of which, as already stated, are prior and purer, and so more easy of digestion; others posterior, and therefore more difficult of transmutation into the substance of the chick. Now the yelk and albumen differ from one another by such kinds of distinction. Perfect eggs are, consequently, of two colours: they consist of albumen and yelk, as if these constituted fluids of easier or more difficult digestion, adapted to the different ages and vigour of the chick.

### EXERCISE 37. Of the manner in which the egg is increased by the albumen

From the history it appears that the rudiments of the eggs in the ovary are of very small size, mere specks, smaller than millet seeds, white and replete with watery fluid: these specks, however, by and by, become yelks, and then surround themselves with albumen.

Aristotle seems to think that the albumen is generated in the way of secretion from the vitellus. It may be well to add his words:
> The sex is not the cause of the double colour, as if the white were derived from the male, the yellow from the female; both are furnished by the female. But one of them is hot, the other is cold. Now these two portions are distinct in animals fraught with much heat; in those that are not so fraught the eggs are not thus distinct. And this is the reason why the conceptions of these are of one colour. But the semen of the male alone sets the conception; therefore is the conception of the bird small and white in the first instance; but in the course of time, and when there is a larger infusion of blood, it becomes entirely yellow; and, last of all, when the heat declines, the white portion, as a humour of equal temperature surrounds it on every side. For the white portion of the egg is, by its nature, moist, and includes animal heat in itself; and it is for this reason that it is seen in the circumference, the yellow and earthy portion remaining in the interior.

Fabricius, however, thinks that "the albumen only adheres to the vitellus by juxtaposition. For while the yelk is rolled through the second uterus and gradually descends, it also gradually assumes to itself the albumen which is there produced, and made ready, that it may be applied to the yelk; until the yelk having passed the middle spirals and reached the last of them, already surrounded with the albumen, it now surrounds itself with the membranes and shell." Fabricius will, therefore, have it that the egg increases in a two-fold manner: "partly by means of the veins, as concerns the vitellus, and partly by an appositive increase, as regards the albumen." And, among other reasons, this was perchance one for the above opinion: that when an egg is boiled hard the albumen is readily split into layers lying one over another. But this also occurs to the yelk still connected with the ovary, when boiled hard.

Wherefore, taught by experience, I rather incline to the opinion of Aristotle; for the albumen is not merely perceived as added in the way Fabricius will have it, but fashioned also, distinguished by chalazae and membranes, and divided into two different portions; and all this in virtue of the inherence of the same vegetative vital principle by which the egg is more conspicuously divided into two distinct substances—a yelk and a white. For the same faculty that presides over the formation of the egg in general presides over the constitution of each of its parts in particular. Neither is it altogether true that the yelk is first formed and the albumen added to it afterwards; for what is seen in the ovary is not the vitellus of the egg, but rather a compound containing the two liquids mingled together. It has the colour of the vitellus, indeed, but in point of consistence it is more like the albumen; and when boiled hard it is not friable like the proper yelk, but, like the white, is concreted, jelly-like, and seen to be composed of thin lamellae; and it has a kind of white papula, or spot, in the middle.

Aristotle seems to derive this separation from the dissimilar nature of the yelk and white; for he says, as we have already stated, that if a number of eggs be thrown into a pan and boiled, in such wise that the heat shall not be quicker than the separation of the eggs (*citatior quam ovorum distinctio*), the same thing will take place in the mass of eggs which occurs in the individual egg: the whole of the yelks will set in the middle, the whites round about them.

This I have myself frequently found to be true on making the trial, and it is open to anyone to repeat the experiment; let him only beat yelks and whites together, put the mixture into a Dutch oven, or between two plates over the fire, and having added some butter, cause it to set slowly into a cake, he will find the albumen covering over the yelks situated at the bottom.

## EXERCISE 38. Of what the Cock and Hen Severally Contribute to the Production of the Egg

Both cock and hen are to be reputed parents of the chick; for both are necessary principles of an egg, and we have proved both to be alike its efficient: the hen fashions the egg, the cock makes it fertile. Both, consequently, are instruments of the plastic virtue by which this species of animal is perpetuated.

But as in some species there appears to be no occasion for males, females sufficing of themselves to continue the kind; so do we discover no males among these, but females only, containing the fertile rudiments of eggs in their interior; in other species, again, none but males are discovered which procreate and preserve their kinds by emitting something into the mud, or earth, or water. In such instances nature appears to have been content with a single sex, which she has used as an instrument adequate to procreation.

Another class of animals has a generative fluid fortuitously, as it were, and without any distinction of sex; the origin of such animals is spontaneous. But "as some things are made by art, and some depend on accident, health for example," so also some semen of animals is not produced by the act of an individual agent, as in the case of a man engendered by a man; but in some sort univocally, as in those instances where the rudiments and matter, produced by accident, are susceptible of taking on the same motions as seminal matter, as in "animals which do not proceed from coitus, but arise spontaneously, and have such an origin as insects which engender worms." For as mechanics perform some operations with their unaided hands, and others not without the assistance of particular tools; and as the more excellent and varied and curious works of art require a greater variety in the form and size of the tools to bring them to perfection, inasmuch as a greater number of motions and a larger amount of subordinate means are required to bring more worthy labours to a successful issue—art imitating nature here as everywhere else, so also does nature make use of a larger number and variety of forces and instruments as necessary to the procreation of the more perfect animals. For the sun, or Heaven, or whatever name is used to designate that which is understood as the common generator or parent of all animated things, engenders some of themselves, by accident, without an instrument, as it were, and equivocally; and others through the concurrence of a single individual, as in those instances where an animal is produced from another animal of the same genus which supplies both matter and form to the being engendered; so in like manner in the generation of the most perfect animals where principles are distinguished, and the seminal elements of animated beings are divided, a new creation is not effected save by the concurrence of male and female, or by two necessary instruments. Our hen's egg is of this kind; to its production in the perfect state the cock and the hen are necessary. The hen engenders in herself, and therefore does she supply place and matter, nourishment and warmth; but the cock confers fecundity; for the male, as Aristotle says, always perfects generation, secures the presence of a sensitive vital principle, and from such an egg an animal is engendered.

To the cock, therefore, as well as to the hen, are given the organs requisite to the function with which he is entrusted; in the hen all the genital parts are adapted to receive and contain, as in the cock they are calculated to give and immitt, or prepare that which transfers fecundity to the female, he engendering, as it were, in another, not in himself.

When we anatomize the organs appropriated to generation, therefore, we readily distinguish what each sex contributes in the process; for a knowledge of the instruments here leads us by a direct path to a knowledge of their functions.

## EXERCISE 39. Of the Cock and the Particulars Most Remarkable in His Constitution

The cock, as stated, is the prime efficient of the perfect or fruitful hen's egg, and the chief cause of generation: without the male no chick would ever be produced from an egg, and in many ovipara not even would any egg be produced. It is, therefore, imperative on us that we look narrowly into his offices and uses, and inquire particularly what he contributes to the egg and chick, both in the act of intercourse and at other times.

It is certain that the cock in coition emits his "geniture," commonly called semen, from his sexual parts, although he has no penis, as I maintain; because his testes and long and ample *vasa deferentia* are full of this fluid. But whether it issues in jets, with a kind of spirituous briskness and repeatedly as in the hotter viviparous animals, or not, I have not been able to ascertain. But as I do not find any *vesiculae* containing semen, from which, made brisk and raised into a froth by the spirits, it might be emitted; nor any penis through whose narrower orifice it might be forcibly ejaculated, and so strike upon the interior of the hen; and particularly when I see the act of intercourse so rapidly performed between them; I am disposed to believe that the parts of the hen are merely moistened with a very small quantity of seminal fluid, only as much as will adhere to the orifice of the pudenda, and that the prolific fluid is not emitted by any sudden ejaculation; so that whilst among animals repeated ejaculations take place during the same connexion, among birds, which are not delayed with any complexity of venereal apparatus, the same object is effected by repeated connexions. Animals that are long in connexion, copulate rarely; and this is the case with the swan and ostrich among birds. The cock, therefore, as he cannot stay long in his connexions, supplies by dint of repeated treadings the reiterated ejaculations of the single intercourse in other animals; and as he has neither penis nor glans, still the extremities of the *vasa deferentia*, inflated with spirits when he treads, become turgid in the manner of a *glans penis*, and the orifice of the uterus of the hen, compressed by them, her cloaca being exposed for the occasion, is anointed with genital fluid, which consequently does not require a penis for its intromission.

We have said, however, that such was the virtue of the semen of the cock, that not only did it render the uterus, the egg in utero, and the vitelline germ in the ovary, but the whole hen prolific, so that even the germs of vitelli, yet to be produced, were impregnated.

Fabricius has well observed that the quantity of spermatic fluid contained in the testes and *vasa deferentia* of the cock was large; not that the hen requires much to fecundate each of her eggs, but that the cock may have a supply for the large number of hens he serves and for his repeated addresses to them.

The shortness and straight course of the spermatic vessels in the cock also assist the rapid emission of the spermatic fluid: anything that must pass through lengthened and tortuous conduits, of course, escapes more slowly and requires a greater exercise of the impelling power or spirit to force it away.

Among male animals there is none that is more active or more haughty and erect, or that has stronger powers of digestion than the cock, which turns the larger portion of his food into semen; hence it is that he requires so many wives—ten or even a dozen. For there are some animals, single males of which suffice for several females, as we see among deer, cattle, &c.; and there are others, of which the females are so prurient that they are scarcely satisfied with several males, such as the bitch and the wolf; whence prostitutes were called *lupae* or wolves, as making their persons common; and stews were entitled *lupanaria*. Whilst some animals, of a more chaste disposition, live, as it were, in the conjugal estate, so that the male is married to a single female only, and both take part in providing for the wants of the family; for since nature requires that the male supply the deficiencies of the female in the work of generation, and as she alone in many cases does not suffice to cherish and feed and protect the young, the male is added to the wife that he may take part in the burden of bringing up the offspring. Partridges lead a wedded life, because the females alone cannot incubate such a number of eggs as they lay (so that they are said, by some, to make two nests), nor to bring up such a family as by and by appears without assistance. The male pigeon also assists in building the nest, takes his turn in incubating the eggs, and is active in feeding the young. In the same way many other instances of conjugal life among the lower animals might be quoted, and indeed we shall have occasion to refer to several in what yet remains to be said.

Those males, among animals, which serve several females, such as the cock, have an abundant secretion of seminal fluid, and are provided with long and ample *vasa deferentia*. And at whatever time or season the clustered rudimentary papulae in the ovary come to maturity and require fecundation, that they may go on to be turned into perfect eggs, the males will then be found to have an abundance of seminal fluid, and the testicles to enlarge and become conspicuous in the very situation to which they transfer their fecundating influence, viz., the *praecordia*. This is remarkable in fishes, birds, and the whole race of oviparous animals; the males of which teem with fecundating seminal fluid at the same precise seasons as the females become full of eggs.

Whatever parts of the hen, therefore, are destined by nature for purposes of generation, viz., the ovary, the infundibulum, the *processus uteri*, the uterus itself, and the pudenda; as also the situation of these parts, their structure, dimensions, temperature, and all that follows this; all these, I say, are either subordinate to the production and growth of the egg, or to intercourse and the reception of fecundity from the male; or, for the sake of parturition, to which they conduce either as principal and convenient means, or as means necessary, and without which what is done could not be accomplished; for nothing in nature's works is fashioned either carelessly or in vain. In the same way all the parts in the cock are fashioned subordinate to the preparation or concoction of the spermatic fluid, and its transference to the hen.

Now those males that are so vigorously constituted as to serve several females are larger and handsomer, and in the matter of spirit and arms excel their females in a far greater degree than the males of those that live attached to a single female. Neither the male partridge, nor the crow, nor the pigeon, is distinguished from the female bird in the same decided way as the cock from his hens, the stag from his does, &c.

The cock, therefore, as he is gayer in his plumage, better armed, more courageous and pugnacious, so is he replete with semen, and so apt for repeated intercourse, that unless he have a number of wives he distresses them by his frequent assaults; he not only invites but compels them to his pleasure, and leaping upon them at inconvenient and improper seasons (even when they are engaged in the business of incubation) and wearing off the feathers from their backs, he truly does them an injury. I have occasionally seen hens so torn and worn by the ferocious addresses of the cock, that with their backs stripped of feathers and laid bare in places, even to the bone, they languished miserably for a time and then died. The same thing also occurs among pheasants, turkeys, and other species.

## EXERCISE 40. Of the Hen

There are two instruments and two first causes of generation, the male and the female—for to the hen seems to belong the formation of the egg, as to the cock the fertilizing principle. In the act of intercourse, then, of these two, that which renders the egg fruitful is either transmitted from the male to the female, or by means of coition is generated in the hen. The nature of this principle, however, is no less difficult to ascertain than are the particulars of its communication, whether, for instance, we suppose such communication to take place with the whole system of the hen, or simply with her womb, or with the egg already formed, or further, with all the eggs now commencing and hereafter about to commence their existence in the ovary. For it is probable, from what I have formerly mentioned, and also from the experiment of Fabricius, that but a few acts of intercourse, and the consorting of the hen with the cock for some days, are sufficient to fecundate her, or at least her womb, during the whole year. And so far I can myself affirm, from my own observation, to wit, that the twentieth egg laid by a hen, after separation from the cock, has proved prolific. So that, in like manner as it is well known that, from the seed of male fishes shed into the water, a large mass of ova is impregnated, and that in dogs, pigs, and other animals, a small number of acts of intercourse suffice for the procreation of many young ones (some even think it well established, that if a bitch have connexion more than three or four times, her fruitfulness is impaired, and that more females than males are then engendered), so may the cock, by a few treadings, render prolific not only the egg in the womb, but also the whole ovarium, and, as has been often said, the hen herself. Nay, what is more remarkable, and indeed wonderful, it is said that in Persia, on cutting open the female mouse, the young ones still contained in the belly are already pregnant; in other words, they are mothers before they are born! as if the male rendered not only the female fruitful, but also impregnated the young which she had conceived; in the same way as our cock fertilizes not merely the hen, but also the eggs which are about to be produced by her.

But this is confidently denied by those physicians who assert that conception is produced from a mixture of the seed of each sex. And hence Fabricius, although he affirms that the seed of the cock ejected in coition never does, nor can, enter the cavity of the womb, where the egg is formed, or takes its increase, and though he plainly sees that the eggs when first commencing in the ovarium are, no less than those which exist in the womb, fecundated by the same act of coition, and that of these no part could arise from the semen of the cock, yet has he supposed that this semen, as if it must needs be present and permanent, is contained during the entire year in the *bursa* of the fruitful hen, and reserved in a *foramen caecum*. This opinion we have already rejected, as well because that cavity is found in the male and female equally, as because neither there, nor anywhere else in the hen, have we been able to discover this stagnant semen of the cock; as soon as it has performed its office, and impressed a prolific power on the female, it either escapes out of the body, or is dissolved, or is turned into vapour and vanishes. And although Galen, and all physicians with him, oppose by various reasonings this dissolving of the semen, yet, if they carefully trace the anatomical arrangement of the genital parts, and at the same time weigh other proofs of the strongest kind, they must confess that the semen of the male, as it is derived from the testicles through the *vasa deferentia*, and as it is contained in the *vesiculae seminales*, is not prolific unless it be rendered spiritual and effervesce into a frothy nature by the incitement of intercourse or desire. For it is not, as Aristotle bears witness, its bodily form, or fire, or any such faculty, that renders the semen prolific, but the spirit which is contained in it, and the nature which inheres in it, bearing a proportion to the element of the stars. Wherefore, though we should allow with Fabricius that the semen is retained in the *bursa*, yet, when that prolific effervescence or spirit had been spent, it would forthwith be useless and sterile. Hence, too, physicians may learn that the semen of the male is the architect of the progeny, not because the first conception is embodied out of it, but because it is spiritual and effervescent, as if swelling with a fertilizing spirit, and a preternatural influence. For otherwise the story of Averrhoes, of the woman who conceived in a bath, might bear an appearance of truth. But of these things more in their proper place.

In the same manner then as the egg is formed from the hen, so is it probable, that from the females of other animals, as will hereafter be shown, the first conceptions take both material and form; and that, too, some little time after the semen of the male has been introduced, and has disappeared again. For the cock does not confer any fecundity on the hen, or her eggs, by the simple emission of his semen, but only in so far as that fluid has a prolific quality, and is imbued with a plastic power; that is to say, is spiritual, operative, and analogous to the essence of the stars. The male, therefore, is no more to be considered the first principle, from which conceptions and the embryo arise, because he is capable of secreting and emitting semen, than is the female, which creates an egg without his assistance. But it is on this consideration rather that he is entitled to his prerogative, that he introduces his semen, imbued as it is with the spirit and the virtue of a divine agent, such as, in a moment of time, performs its functions, and conveys fertility. For, as we see things suddenly set on fire and blasted by a spark struck from a flint, or the lightning flashing from a cloud, so equally does the seed of the male instantly affect the female which it has touched with a kind of contagion, and transfer to her its prolific quality, by which it renders fruitful in a moment, not only the eggs, but the uterus also, and the hen herself. For an inflammable material is not set on fire by the contact of flame more quickly than is the hen made pregnant by intercourse with the cock. But what it is that is transferred from him to her, we shall afterwards find occasion to speak of, when we treat this matter specially and at greater length.

In the meantime, we must remark, that, if it be derived from the soul (for whatever is fruitful is probably endowed also with a soul; and we have said before, that the egg, in Aristotle's opinion, as well as the seeds of plants, has a vegetative soul), that soul, or at all events the vegetative one, must be communicated as a graft, and transferred from the male to the female, from the female to the egg, from the egg to the foetus; or else be generated in each of these successively by the contagion of coition.

The subject, nevertheless, seems full of ambiguity; and so Aristotle, although he allows that the semen of the male has such great virtue that a single emission of it suffices for fecundating very many eggs at the same time, yet, lest this admission should seem to gainsay the efficacy of frequent repetitions of intercourse, he further says, "In birds, not even those eggs which arise through intercourse can greatly increase in size, unless the intercourse be continued; and the reason of this is that, as in women, the menstrual excretion is drawn downwards by sexual intercourse (for the uterus, becoming warm, attracts moisture, and its pores are opened), so also does it happen with birds, in which the menstrual excrement, because it accumulates gradually, and is retained above the cincture, and cannot escape, from being in small quantity, only passes off when it has reached the uterus itself. For by this is the egg increased, as is the foetus of the viviparous animal by that which flows through the umbilicus. For almost all birds, after but a single act of intercourse, continue to produce eggs, but they are small."

Now, so far perhaps would the opinion of Aristotle be correct, that more and larger eggs are procured by frequently-repeated intercourse; because, as he says, there may be "a flow of more fruitful material to the womb, when warmed by the heat of coition"; not, however, that frequent coition must necessarily take place in order to render the eggs that are laid prolific. For experience, as we have said, teaches the contrary, and the reason which he alleges does not seem convincing; since the rudiments of eggs are not formed in the uterus from menstrual blood, which is found in no part of the hen, but in the ovary, where no blood pre-exists, and originate as well without, as along with the intercourse of the cock.

The hen, as well as all other females, supplies matter, nutrition, and place to the conception. The matter, whence the rudiments of all eggs are produced in the ovary and take their increase, seems to be the very same from which all the other parts of the hen, namely, the fleshy, nervous, and bony structures, as well as the head and the rest of the members, are nourished and grow. Nourishment is in fact conveyed to each single papula and yelk contained in the ovary by means of vessels, in the same way precisely as to all the other parts of the hen. But the place where the egg is provided with membranes, and perfected by the addition of the chalazae and shell, is the uterus.

But that the hen neither emits any semen during intercourse, nor sheds any blood into the cavity of the uterus, and that the egg is not formed in the mode in which Aristotle supposed a conception to arise, nor, as physicians imagine, from a mixture of the seminal fluids; as also that the semen of the cock does not penetrate into, nor is attracted towards, the cavity of the uterus of the hen, is all made manifestly clear by this one observation, namely, that after intercourse there is nothing more to be found in the uterus, than there was before the act. And when this shall have been afterwards clearly established and demonstrated to be true of all kinds of animals which conceive in a uterus, it will at the same time be equally evident that what has hitherto been handed down to us from all antiquity on the generation of animals is erroneous; that the foetus is not constituted of the semen either of the male or female, nor of a mixture of the two, nor of the menstrual blood, but that in all animals, as well in the prolific conception as after it, the same series of phenomena occur as in the generation of the chick from the egg, and as in

the production of plants from the seeds of their several kinds. For, besides that, it appears the male is not required as being in himself agent, workman, and efficient cause; nor the female, as if she supplied the matter; but that each, male as well as female, may be said to be in some sort the operative and parent; and the foetus, as a mixture of both, is created a mixed resemblance and kind. Nor is that true which Aristotle often affirms, and physicians take for granted, namely, that immediately after intercourse, something either of the foetus or the conception may be found in the uterus (for instance, the heart, the “three bullae,” or some other principal part), at any rate something—a coagulum, some mixture of the spermatic substances, or other things of the like kind. On the contrary, it is not till long after intercourse that the eggs and conception first commence their existence, among the greater number of animals, and these the most perfect ones; I mean in the cases where the females have been fruitful and have become pregnant. And that the female is prolific, before any conception is contained in the uterus, there are many indications, as will be hereafter set forth in the history of viviparous animals: the breasts enlarge, the uterus begins to swell, and by other symptoms a change of the whole system is discerned.

But the hen, though she have for the most part the rudiments of eggs in her before intercourse, which are afterwards by this act rendered fruitful, and there be, therefore, something in her immediately after coition, yet even when she, as in the case of other animals, has as yet no eggs ready prepared in the ovary, or has at the time of the intercourse got rid of all she had, yet does she by and by, even after some lapse of time, as if in possession of both principles or the powers of both sexes, generate eggs by herself after the manner of plants; and these (I speak from experience) not barren, but prolific.

Nay, what is more, if you remove all the eggs from beneath a hen that has been fecundated and is now sitting (after having already laid all her eggs, and no more remain in the ovary), she will begin to lay again; and the eggs thus laid will be prolific, and have both principles inherent in them.

### EXERCISE 41. Of the sense in which the hen may be called the "prime efficient": and of her parturition

It has already been said that the hen is the efficient cause of generation, or an instrument of Nature in this work, not indeed immediately, or of herself; but when rendered prolific by commission from, and in virtue of the male. But as the male is considered by Aristotle to be the first principle of generation on his own merits, because the first impulse toward generation proceeds from him, so may the hen in some measure be put down as the first cause of generation; inasmuch as the male is undoubtedly inflamed to venery by the presence of the female.

> “The female fish,” says Pliny,^ “will follow the male at the season of intercourse, and strike his belly with her nose; at the spawning time the male will do the like to the female.”

I have myself at times seen male fishes in shoals following a female that was on the point of spawning, in the same way as dogs pursue a bitch, that they might sprinkle the ova just laid with their milk or seed. But this is particularly to be remarked in the more wanton and lascivious females, who stir up the dormant fires of Cupid, and inspire a silent love; hence it is that the common cock, so soon as he sees one of his own hens that has been absent for ever so short a time, or any other stranger-hen, forthwith feels the sting of desire, and treads her. Moreover, victorious in a battle, although wounded and tired from the fight, he straightway sets about treading the wives of his vanquished foe one after another. And that he may further feed the flame of love thus kindled in his breast, by various gesticulations, incitements, and caresses, often crowing the while, calling his hens to him, approaching and walking round them, and tripping himself with his wings, he entices his females to intercourse as by a kind of fascination. Such are the arts of the male; but sometimes a certain sullenness of the female, and an apparent disinclination on her part, contribute not a little to arouse the ardour of the male and stimulate his languishing desire, so that he fills her more quickly and more copiously with prolific spirit. But of allurements of this kind, and in what degree they promote conception, we shall speak more hereafter. For, if you carefully weigh the works of nature, you will find that nothing in them was made in vain, but that all things were ordered with a purpose and for the sake of some good end.
[^1]: *Hist. nat.*, ix. 50.

Almost all females, though they have pleasure in the act of intercourse and impregnation, suffer pain in parturition. But the reverse is the case with the hen, who loudly complains during intercourse and struggles against it; but in parturition, although the egg be very large in comparison with the body and the orifice of the uterus, and it does nothing to further its exit (as is customary with the young of viviparous animals), yet she brings forth easily and without pain, and immediately afterwards commences her exultations; and with her loud cackling calls the cock, as it seems, to share in her triumph.

But, although many rudiments of eggs are found in the hen's ovary, of various sizes and in different stages, so that some are larger and nearer to maturity than others, yet all of them appear to be fecundated, or to receive the prolific faculty from the tread of the cock at the same time and in the same degree. And though a considerable time elapse (namely, thirty or more days) before the common hen or hen-partridge lay all the eggs which she has conceived, yet in a stated time after the mother has begun to sit upon them (say twenty or twenty-two days) all the young are hatched nearly at the same time; nor are they less perfect than if they had commenced their origin simultaneously, from the period of one and the same conception, as the whelps of bitches do.

And while we are here, and while I think how small are the prolific germs of eggs, mere papillae and exudations less than millet-seeds, and contemplate the full proportions of the cock that springs from thence, his fine spirit, and his handsome plumage, I cannot but express my admiration that such strength should be reposed in the nature of things in such insignificant elements, and that it has pleased the omnipotent Creator out of the smallest beginnings to exhibit some of his greatest works. From a minute and scarce perceptible papula springs the hen, or the cock, a proud and magnificent creature. From a small seed springs a mighty tree; from the minute gemmule or apex of the acorn, how wide does the gnarled oak at length extend his arms, how loftily does he lift his branches to the sky, how deeply do his roots strike down into the ground!

> “It is in truth a great miracle of nature,” says Pliny,^ “that from so small an origin is produced a material that resists the axe, and that supplies beams, masts, and battering-rams. Such is the strength, such the power of nature!”

But in the seeds of all plants there is a gemmule or bud of such a kind, so small that if the top only, a very point, be lost, all hope of propagation is immediately destroyed; in so small a particle does all the plastic power of the future tree seem lodged! The provident ant by gnawing off this little particle stores safely in her subterraneous hoard the grain and other seeds she gathers, and ingeniously guards against their growing: “The cypress,” adds Pliny, in the same place, “bears a seed that is greatly sought after by the ant; which makes us still further wonder that the birth of mighty trees should be consumed in the food of so small an animal.” But on these points we shall say more when we show that many animals, especially insects, arise and are propagated from elements and seeds so small as to be invisible (like atoms flying in the air), scattered and dispersed here and there by the winds; and yet these animals are supposed to have arisen spontaneously, or from decomposition, because their ova are nowhere to be found. These considerations, however, may furnish arguments to that school of philosophy which teaches that all things are produced from nothing; and indeed there is hardly any ascertainable proportion between the rudiment and the full growth of any animal.
[^2]: *Ibid.*, XVII. 10.

Nor should we so much wonder what it is in the cock that preserves and governs so perfect and beautiful an animal, and is the first cause of that entity which we call the soul; but much more, what it is in the egg, aye, in the germ of the egg, of so great virtue as to produce such an animal, and raise him to the very summit of excellence. Nor are we only to admire the greatness of the artificer that aids in the production of so noble a work, but chiefly the “contagion” of intercourse, an act which is so momentary! What is it, for instance, that passes from the male into the female, from the female into the egg, from the egg into the chick? What is this transitory thing, which is neither to be found remaining, nor touching, nor contained, as far as the senses inform us, and yet works with the highest intelligence and foresight, beyond all art; and which, even after it has vanished, renders the egg prolific, not because it now touches, but because it formerly did so, and that not merely in the case of the perfect and completed egg, but of the imperfect and commencing one when it was yet but a speck; aye, and makes the hen herself fruitful before she has yet produced any germs of eggs, and this too so suddenly, as if it were said by the Almighty, “Let there be progeny,” and straight it is so.

Let physicians, therefore, cease to wonder at what always excites their astonishment, namely, the manner in which epidemic, contagious, and pestilential diseases scatter their seeds, and are propagated to a distance through the air, or by some fomes producing diseases like themselves, in bodies of a different nature, and in a hidden fashion silently multiplying themselves by a kind of generation, until they become so fatal, and with the permission of the Deity spread destruction far and wide among man and beast; since they will find far greater wonders than these taking place daily in the generation of animals. For agents in greater number and of more efficiency are required in the construction and preservation of an animal, than for its destruction; since the things that are difficult and slow of growth, decay with ease and rapidity. Seneca observes, with his usual elegance,

> “How long a time is needed for conception to be carried out to parturition! with what labour and tenderness is an infant reared! to what diligent and continued nutrition must the body be subject, to arrive at adolescence! but by what a nothing is it destroyed! It takes an age to establish cities, an hour to destroy them. By great watching are all things established and made to flourish, quickly and of a sudden do they fall in pieces. That which becomes by long growth a forest, quickly, in the smallest interval of time, and by a spark, is reduced to ashes.”^

Nor is even a spark necessary, since by the solar rays transmitted through a small piece of glass and concentrated to a focus, fire may be immediately produced, and the largest things be set in flames. So easy is everything to nature’s majesty, who uses her strength sparingly, and dispenses it with caution and foresight for the commencement of her works by imperceptible additions, but hastens to decay with suddenness and in full career. In the generation of things is seen the most excellent, the eternal and almighty God, the divinity of nature, worthy to be looked up to with reverence; but all mortal things run to destruction of their own accord in a thousand ways.
[^3]: *Nat. quaest.*, iii. 27.

### EXERCISE 42. Of the manner in which the generation of the chick takes place from the egg

Hitherto we have considered the egg as the fruit and end; it still remains for us to treat of it as the seed and beginning.

> “We must now inquire,” says Fabricius,^ “how the generation of the chick results from the egg, setting out from that principle of Aristotle and Galen, which is, even conceded by all, to wit, that all things which are made in this life, are manifestly made by these three: workers, instruments, and matter.”

But since in natural phenomena, the work is not extrinsic, but is included in the matter, or the instruments, he concludes that we must take cognizance only of the agent and the matter.

As we are here about to show in what manner the chick arises from the egg, however, I think it may be of advantage for me to preface this by showing the number of modes in which one thing may be said to be made from another.

For so it will appear, more clearly and distinctly, after which of these generation takes place in the egg, and what are the right conclusions in regard to its matter, its instruments, and efficient cause.

Aristotle has laid down that there are four modes in which one thing is made from another:

> “first, when we say that from day night is made, or from a boy a man, since one is after the other; secondly, when we say that a statue is made from brass, or a bed from wood, or anything else from a certain material, so that the whole consists of something, which is inherent and made into a form; thirdly, as when from a musical man is made an unmusical one, or from a healthy, a sick one, or contraries in any way: fourthly, as Epicharmus exaggerates it, as of calumnies, cursing; of cursing, fighting. But all these are to be referred to that from whence the movement took its rise; for the calumny is a certain portion of the whole quarrel. Since then these are the methods in which one thing is made from another, it is clear that the seed is in one of two of these. For that which is born arises out of it, either as from matter, or as from the prime mover. For it is not, ‘as this is after that,’ in the same way as after the Panathenoea navigation; nor as ‘one contrary from another’; for in such case, a thing would be born out of its contrary, because it is in a state of decay, and there must be something else as subject-matter.”^
[^4]: *Op. cit.*, p. 28.
[^5]: *On the Generation of Animals*, i. 18.

By these words, Aristotle rightly infers that the semen proceeding from the male is the efficient or instrumental cause of the embryo; since it is no part of what is born, either in the first or third manner (namely, as one thing is after another, or as it is out of its contrary); nor does it arise from the subject-matter.

But then, as he adds, in the same place,

> “that which comes out of the male in coition, is not with truth and propriety called semen, but rather geniture; and it is different from the seed properly so called. For that is called the geniture which, proceeding from the generant, is the cause which first promotes the beginning of generation. I mean in those creatures which nature designed to have connexion; but the seed is that which derives its origin from the intercourse of the two (i.e., of the male and female); such is the seed of all plants; and of some animals in which the sex is not distinct; it is the produce, as it were, of the male and female mixed together originally, like a kind of promiscuous conception”;

and such as we have formerly in our history declared the egg to be, which is called both fruit and seed. For the seed and the fruit are distinct from each other, and in the relation of antecedent and consequent; the fruit is that which is out of something else, the seed is that out of which something else comes; otherwise, both were the same.

It remains then, to inquire, in how many of the aforesaid ways the foetus may arise, not indeed from the geniture of the male, but out of the true seed, or out of the egg or conception, which is in reality the seed of animals.

### EXERCISE 43. In how many ways the chick may be said to be formed from the egg

It is admitted, then, that the foetus is formed from a prolific egg, as out of the proper matter, and as it were by the requisite agency, and that the same egg stands for both causes of the chick. For inasmuch as it derives its origin from the hen, and is considered as a fruit, it is the matter: but, in so far as it contains in its whole structure the prolific and plastic faculty infused by the male, it is called the efficient cause of the chick.

Moreover, not only as Fabricius supposed, are these, namely, the agent and the instrument, inseparably joined in one and the same egg, but it is also necessary that the aliment by which the chick is nourished be present in the same place. Indeed, in the prolific egg, these four are found together, to wit, the agent, the instrument, the matter, and the aliment, as we have shown in our history.

Wherefore, we say, that the chick is formed from the prolific egg in all the aforesaid ways, namely, as from matter, by an efficient, and by an instrument; and moreover, as a man grows out of a boy, as the whole is made up of its parts, and as a thing grows from its nutriment; a contrary thing springs from a contrary.

For after incubation is begun, as soon as by the internal motive principle a certain clear liquid which we have called the eye of the egg is produced, we say that that liquid is made, as it were, out of a contrary; in the same way as we suppose the chyle through concoction to be formed out of its contraries (namely, crude articles of food), and in the same way as we are said to be nourished by contraries; so, from the albumen is formed and augmented that to which we have given the names of the eye and the colliquament; and in the same manner, from that clear fluid do the blood and pulsating vesicle, the first particles of the chick, receive their being, nutrition, and growth. The nutriment, I say, is by the powers of an inherent and innate heat, assimilated by means of concoction, as it were, out of a contrary. For the crude and unconcocted are contrary to the concocted and assimilated, as the unmusical man is to the musical, and the sick to the sound man.

And when the blood is engendered from the clear colliquament, or a clear fluid is produced from the white or the yelk, there is generation as regards the former, corruption as regards the latter; a transmutation, namely, is made from the extremes of contraries, the subject-matter all the while remaining the same. To explain: by the breaking up of the first form of the white, the colliquament is produced; and from the consumption of this colliquament, follows the form of the blood, in the same way precisely as food is converted into the substance of the thing fed.

It is thus, then, that the chick is said to be made out of the egg, as it were by a contrary; for in the nutrition and growth of the chick in the egg, white and yelk are equally broken up and consumed, and finally the whole substance of the egg. It is clear, therefore, that the chick is formed from the egg, as it were, by a contrary, namely, the aliment, and as if by an abstraction, and from a non-entity. For the first particle of the chick, viz., the blood or *punctum saliens*, is constituted out of something which is not blood, and altogether its contrary, the same subject-matter always remaining.

The chick too is made from the egg, as a man is made from a boy. For in the same way, as out of plants seeds arise, and out of seeds, buds, sprouts, stems, flowers, and fruits; so also out of the egg, the seed of the hen is produced, the dilatation of the cicatricula and the colliquament, the blood and the heart, as the first particle of the foetus or fruit; and all this, in the same way as the day from the night, the summer from the spring, a man from a boy—one follows or comes after the other. So that, in the same way as fruits arise after flowers on the same stem, so likewise is the colliquament formed after the egg, the blood after this, as from the primogeneous humour, the chick after the blood, and out of it, as the whole out of a part; in the same way, as by Epicharmus’ exaggeration, out of calumnies comes cursing, and out of cursing, fighting. For the blood first begins its existence with the *punctum saliens*, and at the same time, seems to be as well a part of the chick, and a kind of efficient or instrument of its generation, inseparable, as Fabricius thinks, from the agent. But how the egg may be called the efficient and instrument of generation, has partly been explained already, and will be illustrated more copiously by what we shall presently say.

So much has been fully established in our history, that the *punctum pulsans* and the blood, in the course of their growth, attach round themselves the rest of the body, and all the other members of the chick, just as the yelk in the uterus, after being evolved from the ovary, surrounds itself with the white; and this not without concoction and nutrition. Now the common instrument of all vegetative operations, is, in the opinion of all men, an internal heat or *calidum innatum*, or a spirit diffused through the whole, and in that spirit a soul or faculty of a soul. The egg, therefore, beyond all doubt, has its own operative soul, which is all in the whole, and all in each individual part, and contains within itself a spirit or animal heat, the immediate instrument of that soul. To one who should ask, then, how the chick is made from the egg, we answer: after all the ways recited by Aristotle, and devised by others, in which it is possible for one thing to be made from another.

### EXERCISE 44. Fabricius is mistaken with regard to the matter of the generation of the chick *in ovo*

As I proposed to myself at the outset, I continue to follow Fabricius as pointing out the way; and we shall, therefore, consider the three things which he says are to be particularly regarded in the generation of the chick, viz.: the agent, the matter, and the nourishment of the embryo. These must needs be all contained in the egg; he proposes various doubts or questions, and quotes the opinions of the most weighty authorities in regard to them, these opinions being frequently discordant. The first difficulty is in reference to the matter and nourishment of the chick. Hippocrates,^ Anaxagoras, Alcmaeon, Menander, and the ancient philosophers all thought that the chick was engendered from the vitellus, and was nourished by the albumen. Aristotle,^ however, and after him, Pliny,^ maintained, on the contrary, that the chick was incorporated from the albumen, and nourished by the vitellus. But Fabricius himself, will have it that neither the white nor yelk forms the matter of the chick; he strives to combat both of the preceding opinions, and teaches that the white and the yellow alike do no more than nourish the chick. One of his arguments, amongst a great number of others which I think are less to be acquiesced in, appears to me to have some force. The branches of the umbilical vessels, he says, through which the embryo undoubtedly imbibes its nourishment, are distributed to the albumen and the vitellus alike, and both of these fluids diminish as the chick grows. And it is on this ground, that Fabricius in confirmation of his opinion, says:

> “Of the bodies constituting the egg, and adapted to forward the generation of the chick, there are only three, the albumen, the vitellus, and the chalazae; now the albumen and vitellus are the nourishment of the chick; so that the chalazae alone remain as matter from which it can be produced.”^

Nevertheless, that the excellent Fabricius is in error here, we have demonstrated above in our history. For after the chick is already almost perfected, and its head and its eyes are distinctly visible, the chalazae can readily be found entire, far from the embryo, and pushed from the apices towards the sides: the office of these bodies, as Fabricius himself admits, is that of ligaments, and to preserve the vitellus in its proper position within the albumen. Nor is that true, which Fabricius adds in confirmation of his opinion, namely, that the chalazae are situated in the direction of the blunt part of the egg.
[^6]: *De nat. pueri.*
[^7]: *History of Animals*, vi. 3; *On the Generation of Animals*, iii. 1, 2.
[^8]: *Hist. nat.*, x. 53.
[^9]: *Op. cit.*, p. 34.

For after even a single day's incubation, the relative positions of the fluids of the egg are changed, the yelk being drawn upwards, and the chalazae on either hand removed, as we have already had occasion to say.

He is also mistaken when he speaks of the chalazae, as proper parts of the egg. The egg consists in fact but of white and yelk; the chalazae as well as the membranes, are mere appendages of the albumen and vitellus. The chalazae, in particular, are the extremities of certain membranes, twisted and knotted; they are produced in the same way as a rope is formed by the contortion of its component filaments, and exist for the purpose of more certainly securing the several elements of the egg in their respective places.

Fabricius, therefore, reasons ill when he says, that “the chalazae are found in the part of the egg where the embryo is produced, wherefore it is engendered from them”; for even on his own showing, this could never take place, he admitting that the chalazae are extant in either extremity of the egg, whilst the chick never makes its appearance save at the blunt end; in which, moreover, at the first commencement of generation, no chalaza can be seen. Further, if you examine the matter in a fresh egg, you will find the superior chalaza not immediately under the blunt end or its cavity, but declined somewhat to the side; not to that side, however, where the cavity is extending, but rather to the opposite side. Still further, from what has preceded, it is obvious that the relative positions of the fluids of the egg are altered immediately that incubation is begun: the eye increased by the colliquament is drawn up towards the cavity in the blunt end of the egg, whence the white and the chalaza are on either hand withdrawn to the side. For the macula or cicatricula which before incubation was situated midway between the two ends, now increased into the eye of the egg, adjoins the cavity in the blunt end, and whilst one of the chalazae is depressed from the blunt end, the other is raised from the sharp end, in the same way as the poles of a globe are situated when the axis is set obliquely; the greater portion of the albumen, particularly that which is thicker, subsides at the same time, into the sharp end.

Neither is it correct to say that the chalazae bear a resemblance in length and configuration to the chick on its first formation, and that the

number of their nodules corresponds with the number of the principal parts of the embryo; a statement which gives Fabricius an opportunity of adducing an argument connected with the matter of the chick, based on the similarity of its consistency to that of the chalazae. But the red mass (which Fabricius regarded as the liver) is neither situated in nor near the chalaza, but in the middle of the clear colliquament; and it is not any rudiment of the liver but of the heart alone. Neither does his view square with the example he quotes of the tadpole, “of which,” he says, “there is nothing to be seen but the head and the tail, that is to say, the head and spine, without a trace of upper or lower extremities.” And he adds, “he who has seen a chalaza, and this kind of conception, in so far as the body is concerned, will believe that in the former, he has already seen the latter.” I, however, have frequently dissected the tadpole, and have found the belly of large size, and containing intestines and liver and heart pulsating; I have also distinguished the head and the eyes. The part which Fabricius takes for the head, is the rounded mass of the tadpole, whence the creature is called from its circular form. It has a tail with which it swims, but is without legs. About the epoch of the summer solstice, it loses the tail, when the extremities begin to sprout. Nothing however occurs in the nature of a division of the embryo pullet into the head and spine, which should induce us to regard it as produced from the chalazae, and in the same manner as the tadpole.

The position and fame of Fabricius, however, a man exceedingly well skilled in anatomy, do not allow me to push this refutation further. Nor indeed, is there any necessity to do so, seeing that the thing is so clearly exhibited in our history.

Our author concludes, by stating that his opinion is of great antiquity, and was in vogue even in the times of Aristotle.

For my own part, nevertheless, I regard the view of Ulysses Aldrovandus as the older, he maintaining that the chalazae are the spermatic fluid of the cock, from which and through which alike the chick is engendered.

Neither notion, however, is founded on fact, but is the popular error of all times: the chalazae, treads, or treadles, as our English name implies, are still regarded by the country folks as the semen of the cock.

“The treadles (*grandines*)” says Aldrovandus: “are the spermatic fluid of the cock, because no fertile egg is without them.” But neither is any unprolific egg without these parts, a fact which Aldrovandus was either ignorant of or concealed. Fabricius admits this fact; but though he has denied that the semen of the male penetrates to the uterus or is ever found in the egg, he, nevertheless, contends that the chalazae alone of all the parts of the egg are impregnated with the prolific power of the egg, and are the repositories of the fecundating influence; and this, with the fact staring him in the face all the while that there is no perceptible difference between the chalazae of a prolific and an unprolific egg. And when he admits that the mere rudiments of eggs in the ovary, as well as the vitelli that are surrounded with albumen, become fecundated through the intercourse of the cock, I conceive that this must have been the cause of the error committed by so distinguished an individual. It was the current opinion, as I have said oftener than once, both among philosophers and physicians, that the matter of the embryo in animal generation, was the geniture, either of the male, or of the female, or resulted from a mixture of the two, and that from this, deposited in the uterus, like a seed in the ground, which produces a plant, the animal was engendered. Aristotle, himself, is not very far from the same view, when he maintains the menstrual blood of the female to be the seed, which the semen of the male coagulates, and so composes the conception.

The error which we have announced, having been admitted by all in former times, as a matter of certainty, it is not to be wondered at that various erroneous opinions, based on each man’s conjecture, should have emanated from it. They, however, are wholly mistaken, who fancy that anything in the shape of a “prepared or fit matter” must necessarily remain in the uterus after intercourse, from which the foetus is produced, or the first conception is formed, or that anything is immediately fashioned in the uterine cavity that corresponds to the seed of a plant deposited in the bosom of the ground. For it is quite certain that, in the uterus of the fowl, and the same thing is true of the uterus of every other female animal, there is nothing discoverable after intercourse more than there was before it.

It appears, consequently, that Fabricius erred when he said: “In the same way as a viviparous animal is incorporated from a small quantity of seminal matter, whilst the matter which is taken up as food and nourishment is very large; so a small chalaza suffices for the generation of a chick, and the rest of the matter contained in the egg goes to it in the shape of nutriment.”^ From which it is obvious, that he sought for some such “prepared matter” in the egg, whence the chick should be incorporated; mainly, as it seems, that he might not be found in contradiction with Aristotle’s definition of an egg, viz.: as “that from part of which an animal is engendered; and the remainder of which is food for the thing engendered.”^

1 *Op. sup. cit.*, p. 35.
2 *History of Animals*, iii. 8.

This of Fabricius, therefore, has the look of a valid argument, namely, “Since there are only three parts in the egg — the albumen, the vitellus, and the chalazae; and the two former alone supply aliment; it necessarily follows that the chalazae alone are the matter from which the chick is constituted.”

Thus, our learned anatomist, blinded by a popular error, seeking in the egg for some particular matter fitted to engender the chick distinct from the rest of the contents of the egg, has gone astray. And so it happens to all, who, forsaking the light, which the frequent dissection of bodies, and familiar converse with nature supplies, expect that they are to understand from conjecture, and arguments founded on probabilities, or the authority of writers, the things or the facts which they ought themselves to behold with their own eyes, to perceive with their proper senses. It is not wonderful, therefore, when we see that we have so many errors accredited by general consent, handed down to us from remote antiquity, that men otherwise of great ingenuity, should be egregiously deceived, which they may very well be, when they are satisfied with taking their knowledge from books, and keeping their memory stored with the notions of learned men. They who philosophize in this way, by tradition, if I may so say, know no better than the books they keep by them.

In the egg then, as we have said, there is no distinct part or prepared matter present, from which the foetus is formed; but in the same way as the apex or gemmule protrudes in a seed; so in the egg, there is a macula or cicatricula, which, endowed with plastic power, grows into the eye of the egg and the colliquament, from which and in which the primordial or rudimentary parts of the chick, the blood, to wit, and the *punctum saliens* are engendered, nourished, and augmented, until the perfect chick is developed. Neither is Aristotle’s definition of an egg correct, as a body from part of which an embryo is formed, and by part of which it is nourished, unless the philosopher is to be understood in the following manner: the egg is a body, from part of which the chick arises, not as from a special matter, but as a man grows out of a boy; or an egg is a perfect conception from which the chick is said to be partly constituted, partly nourished; or to conclude, an egg is a body, the fluids of which serve both for the matter and the nourishment of the parts of the foetus. In this sense, indeed, Aristotle teaches us that the matter of the human foetus is the menstrual blood; “which (when poured into the uterus by the veins) nature employs to a new purpose; viz. that of generation, and that a future being may arise, such as the one from which it springs; for potentially it is already such as is the body whose secretion it is, namely the mother.”^

## EXERCISE 45. What is the material of the chick, and how it is formed in the egg

Since, then, we are of opinion that for the acquisition of truth we cannot rely on the theories of others, whether these rest on mere assertions, or even may have been confirmed by plausible arguments, except there be added thereto a diligent course of observation; we propose to show, by clearly-arranged remarks derived from the book of nature, what is the material of the foetus, and in what manner it thence takes its origin. We have seen that one thing is made out of another (*tanquam ex materia*) in two ways, and this as well in works of art, as in those of nature, and more particularly in the generation of animals.

One of these ways, viz., when the object is made out of something pre-existing, is exemplified by the formation of a bed out of wood, or a statue from stone; in which case, the whole material of the future piece of work has already been in existence, before it is finished into form, or any part of the work is yet begun; the second method is, when the material is both made and brought into form at the same time. Just then as the works of art are accomplished in two manners, one, in which the workman cuts the material already prepared, divides it, and rejects what is superfluous, till he leaves it in the desired shape (as is the custom of the statuary); the other, as when the potter educes a form out of clay by the addition of parts, or increasing its mass, and giving it a figure, at the same time that he provides the material, which he prepares, adapts, and applies to his work (and in this point of view, the form may be said rather to have been made than educed); so exactly is it with regard to the generation of animals.

Some, out of a material previously concocted, and that has already attained its bulk, receive their forms and transfigurations; and all their parts are fashioned simultaneously, each with its distinctive characteristic, by the process called metamorphosis, and in this way a perfect animal is at once born; on the other hand, there are some in which one part is made before another, and then from the same material, afterwards receive at once nutrition, bulk, and form: that is to say, they have some parts made before, some after others, and these are at the same time increased in size and altered in form. The structure of these animals commences from some one part as its nucleus and origin, by the instrumentality of which the rest of the limbs are joined on, and this we say takes place by the method of epigenesis, namely, by degrees, part after part; and this is, in preference to the other mode, generation properly so called.

In the former of the ways mentioned, the generation of insects is effected where by metamorphosis a worm is born from an egg; or out of a putrescent material, the drying of a moist substance or the moistening of a dry one, rudiments are created, from which, as from a caterpillar grown to its full size, or from an aurelia, springs a butterfly or fly already of a proper size, which never attains to any larger growth after it is first born; this is called metamorphosis. But the more perfect animals with red blood are made by epigenesis, or the superaddition of parts. In the former, chance or hazard seems the principal promoter of generation, and there, the form is due to the potency of a pre-existing material; and the first cause of generation is “matter,” rather than “an external efficient”; whence it happens too that these animals are less perfect, less preservative of their own races, and less abiding than the red-blooded terrestrial or aquatic animals, which owe their immortality to one constant source, viz., the perpetuation of the same species; of this circumstance we assign the first cause to nature and the vegetative faculty.

Some animals, then, are born of their own accord, concocted out of matter spontaneously, or by chance, as Aristotle seems to assert, when he speaks of animals whose matter is capable of receiving an impulse from itself, viz., the same impulse given by hazard, as is attributable to the seed, in the generation of other animals. And the same thing happens in art, as in the generation of animals. Some things, which are the result of art, are so likewise of chance, as good health; others always owe their existence to art; for instance, a house. Bees, wasps, butterflies, and whatever is generated from caterpillars by metamorphosis, are said to have sprung from chance, and, therefore, to be not preservative of their own race; the contrary is the case with the lion and the cock; they owe their existence, as it were, to nature or an operative faculty of a divine quality, and require for their propagation an identity of species, rather than any supply of fitting material.

In the generation by metamorphosis forms are created as if by the impression of a seal, or as if they were adjusted in a mould; in truth, the whole material is transformed. But an animal which is created by epigenesis attracts, prepares, elaborates, and makes use of the material, all at the same time; the processes of formation and growth are simultaneous. In the former the plastic force cuts up, and distributes, and reduces into limbs the same homogeneous material; and makes out of a homogeneous material organs which are dissimilar. But in the latter, while it creates in succession parts which are differently and variously distributed, it requires and makes a material which is also various in its nature, and variously distributed, and such as is now adapted to the formation of one part, now of another; on which account we believe the perfect hen’s egg to be constituted of various parts.

Now it appears clear from my history that the generation of the chick from the egg is the result of epigenesis, rather than of metamorphosis, and that all its parts are not fashioned simultaneously, but emerge in their due succession and order; it appears, too, that its form proceeds simultaneously with its growth, and its growth with its form; also that the generation of some parts supervenes on others previously existing, from which they become distinct; lastly, that its origin, growth, and consummation are brought about by the method of nutrition; and that at length the foetus is thus produced. For the formative faculty of the chick rather acquires and prepares its own material for itself than only finds it when prepared, and the chick seems to be formed and to receive its growth from no other than itself. And, as all things receive their growth from the same power by which they are created, so likewise should we believe that by the same power by which the chick is preserved, and caused to grow from the commencement (whether that may have been the soul or a faculty of the soul), by that power, I say, is it also created. For the same efficient and conservative faculty is found in the egg as in the chick; and of the same material of which it constitutes the first particle of the chick, out of the very same does it nourish, increase, and superadd all the other parts. Lastly, in generation by metamorphosis the whole is distributed and separated into parts; but in that by epigenesis the whole is put together out of parts in a certain order, and constituted from them.

Wherefore Fabricius was in error when he looked for the material of the chick (as a distinct part of the egg, from which its body was formed), as if the chick were created by metamorphosis, or a transformation of the material in mass; and as if all, or at least the principal parts of the body sprang from the same material, and, to use his own words, were incorporated simultaneously. [He is, therefore, of course, opposed to the notion] of the chick being formed by epigenesis, in which a certain order is observed according to the dignity and the use of parts, where at first a small foundation is, as it were, laid, which, in the course of growth, has at one and the same time distinct structures formed and its figure established, and acquires an additional birth of parts afterwards, each in its own order; in the same way, for instance, as the bud bursting from the top of the acorn, in the course of its growth, has its parts separately taking the form of root, wood, pith, bark, boughs, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit, until at length out comes a perfect tree; just so is it with the creation of the chick in the egg: the little cicatrix, or small spot, the foundation of the future structure, grows into the eye and is at the same time separated into the colliquament; in the centre of which the *punctum sanguineum pulsans* commences its being, together with the ramification of the veins; to these is presently added the nebula, and the first concretion of the future body; this also, in proportion as its bulk increases, is gradually divided and distinguished into parts, which however do not all emerge at the same time, but one after the other, and each in its proper order. To conclude, then: in the generation of those animals which are created by epigenesis, and are formed in parts (as the chick in the egg), we need not seek one material for the incorporation of the foetus, another for its commencing nutrition and growth; for it receives such nutrition and growth from the same material out of which it is made; and, vice versa, the chick in the egg is constituted out of the materials of its nutrition and growth. And an animal which is capable of nutrition is of the same potency as one which is augmentative, as we shall afterwards show; and they differ only, as Aristotle says, in their distinctness of being; in all other respects they are alike. For, in so far as anything is convertible into a substance, it is nutritious, and under certain conditions it is augmentative: in virtue of its repairing a loss of substance, it is called nutriment, in virtue of its being added, where there is no such loss of substance, it is called increment. Now the material of the chick, in the processes of generation, nutrition, and augmentation is equally to be considered as aliment and increment. We say simply that anything is generated, when no part of it has pre-existed; we speak of its being nourished and growing when it has already existed. The part of the foetus which is first formed is said to be begotten or born; all substitutions or additions are called adnascent, or aggenerate. In all there is the same transmutation or generation from the same to the same; as concerns a part, this is performed by the process of nutrition and augmentation, but as regards the whole, by simple generation; in other respects the same processes occur equally. For from the same source from which the material first takes its existence, from that source also does it gain nutriment and increase. Moreover, from what we shall presently say, it will be made clear that all the parts of the body are nourished by a common nutritious juice; for, as all plants arise from one and the same common nutriment (whether it be dew or a moisture from the earth), altered and concocted in a diversity of manners, by which they are also nourished and grow; so likewise to identical fluids of the egg, namely, the albumen and the yelk, do the whole chick and each of its parts owe their birth and growth.

We will explain, also, what are the animals whose generation takes place by metamorphosis, and of what kind is the pre-existent material of insects which take their origin from a worm or a caterpillar; a material from which, by transmutation alone, all their parts are simultaneously constituted and embodied, and a perfect animal is born; likewise, to what animals any constant order in the successive generation of their parts attaches, as is the case with such as are at first born in an imperfect condition, and afterwards grow to maturity and perfection; and this happens to all those that are born from an egg. As in these the processes of growth and formation are carried on at the same time, and a separation and distinction of parts takes place in a regularly observed order, so in their case is there no immediate pre-existing material present, for the incorporation of the foetus (such as the mixture of the semina of the male and female is generally thought to be, or the menstrual blood, or some very small portion of the egg), but as soon as ever the material is created and prepared, so soon are growth and form commenced; the nutriment is immediately accompanied by the presence of that which it has to feed. And this kind of generation is the result of epigenesis as the man proceeds from the boy; the edifice of the body, to wit, is raised on the *punctum saliens* as a foundation; as a ship is made from a keel, and as a potter makes a vessel, as the carpenter forms a footstool out of a piece of wood, or a statuary his statue from a block of marble. For out of the same material from which the first part of the chick or its smallest particle springs, from the very same is the whole chick born; whence the first little drop of blood, thence also proceeds its whole mass by means of generation in the egg; nor is there any difference between the elements which constitute and form the limbs or organs of the body, and those out of which all their similar parts, to wit, the skin, the flesh, veins, membranes, nerves, cartilages, and bones, derive their origin. For the part which was at first soft and fleshy, afterwards, in the course of its growth, and without any change in the matter of nutrition, becomes a nerve, a ligament, a tendon; what was a simple membrane becomes an investing tunic; what had been cartilage is afterwards found to be a spinous process of bone, all variously diversified out of the same similar material. For a similar organic body (which the vulgar believe to consist of the elements) is not created out of elements at first existing separately, and then put together, united, and altered; nor is it put together out of constituent parts; but, from a transmutation of it when in a mixed state, another compound is created: to take an instance, from the colliquament the blood is formed, from the blood the structure of the body arises, which appears to be homogeneous in the beginning, and resembles the spermatic jelly; but from this the parts are at first delineated by an obscure division, and afterwards become separate and distinct organs.

Those parts, I say, are not made similar by any successive union of dissimilar and heterogeneous elements, but spring out of a similar material through the process of generation, have their different elements assigned to them by the same process, and are made dissimilar. Just as if the whole chick was created by a command to this effect, of the Divine Architect: “Let there be a similar colourless mass, and let it be divided into parts and made to increase, and in the meantime, while it is growing, let there be a separation and delineation of parts; and let this part be harder, and denser, and more glistening, that be softer and more coloured,” and it was so. Now it is in this very manner that the structure of the chick in the egg goes on day by day; all its parts are formed, nourished, and augmented out of the same material. First, from the spine arise the sides, and the bones are distinguishable from the flesh by minute lines of extreme whiteness; in the head three bullae are perceived, full of crystalline fluid, which correspond to the brain, the cerebellum, and one eye, easily observable by a black speck; the substance which at first appears a milky coagulum, afterwards gradually becomes cartilaginous, has spinous processes attached to it, and ends in being completely osseous; what was at first of a mucous nature and colourless, is converted at length into red flesh and parenchyma; what was at one time limpid and perfectly pure water, presently assumes the form of brain, cerebellum, and eyes. For there is a greater and more divine mystery in the generation of animals than the simple collecting together, alteration, and composition of a whole out of parts would seem to imply; inasmuch as here the whole has a separate constitution and existence before its parts, the mixture before the elements. But of this more at another time, when we come to specify the causes of these things.

## EXERCISE 46. Of the efficient cause of the generation of the chick, and foetus

We have thus far spoken of the matter from which the chick in *ovo* is generated. We have still with Fabricius to say a few words on the efficient cause of the chick. As this subject is surrounded with difficulties, however; as writers nowhere else dispute more virulently or more wordily, and Aristotle himself in explaining the matter is singularly intricate and perplexed, and as various questions that can by no means be lightly treated do in fact present themselves for consideration, I conceive that I shall be undertaking a task worthy of the toil if, as I have done in the disquisition on the “matter,” I set out here by stating in how many ways anything can be said to be “efficient” or “effective.” We shall thus obtain a clearer idea of what it is which we are to inquire after under the name of “efficient,” and further, what estimate we are to form of the ideas of writers upon this subject; it will at the same time appear from our observations what is truly and properly to be called “an efficient.”

Aristotle defines an efficient cause to be that “whence is derived the first principle of change or quiescence; as a counsel, a father; and simply as doing that which is done; the transmute of the thing transmuted.” In the generation of animals, accordingly, many and various kinds of causes inducing motion are brought forward; sometimes an accident or quality is assigned; and so animal heat and the formative faculty are called efficient causes. Sometimes it is an external substance, previously existing, in which inheres the plastic force or formative faculty that is designated in the same way; as the cock or his seminal fluid, by the influence of which the chick is procreated from the egg. Occasionally it is some internal substance, self-existent, such as spirit, or innate heat. And again, it is some other substance, such as form, or nature, or soul, or some portion of the vegetative soul, that is regarded as the efficient, such a principle as we have already declared to inhere in the
Besides, since one thing whence motion proceeds is nearer and another more remote, it

sometimes happens that the media between the prime efficient and the thing last effected, and instruments are regarded as efficient causes; subordinate conclusions, likewise, or the principles of subsequents, are reckoned among the number of efficient causes; in this way some parts are themselves spoken of as genital parts, such as the heart, whence Aristotle affirms that all the rest of the body is produced; a statement which we have found borne out by our history. The heart, I repeat, or at all events its rudimentary parts, namely, the vesicle and pulsating point, construct the rest of the body as their future dwelling-place; when erected, it enters and conceals itself within its habitation, which it vivifies and governs, and applying the ribs and sternum as a defence, it walls itself about. And there it abides, the household divinity, first seat of the soul, prime receptacle of the innate heat, perennial centre of animal action; source and origin of all the faculties; only solace in adversity!

Moreover, since the “efficient” is so styled with reference to the effect, as some parts produced by epigenesis are posterior in order to other parts, and are different from antecedent parts. [1] As effects differ, so does it seem probable that efficients also vary: from things that produce different operations, different motions likewise proceed. Thus physicians in their physiologies assign certain organs as the agents of chylification, others of sanguification, others of generation, &c.; and anatomists speak of the ossific, carnific, and neurific faculties, which they conceive produce bones, flesh, and nerves.

But in the generation of the chick, of several actions differing not a little from one another, it is certain that the efficient causes must also differ; those that present themselves to us as accidental efficients of generation must nevertheless be necessary, seeing that unless they are associated or intervene, nothing is effected; those, to wit, are rightly held “efficients” which, whilst they remove external hindrances, either cherish the conception, or stimulate and turn mere potentiality into positive action. Under this head we should arrange incubation, the proper temperature of the air and the place, the spring season, the approach of the sun in the circle of the zodiac; in like manner the preparing causes which lead the *vitellus* to rise, make the *macula* to dilate, and the fluids in the egg to liquefy, are all properly held “efficients.”

Further, to the number of efficient causes are to be reckoned the generative and architectonic faculties, styled parts by Fabricius, viz., the immutative, the concoctive, the formative, the augmentative, as also the effective causes of certain accidentals, viz., that which constitutes the pullet male or female, like the father or the mother, taking after the form of the first or last male having connection with the mother; that too whence the offspring is an animal; whether perfect or defective; robust and healthy, or diseased; longer or shorter lived; keeping up the characters of the race or degenerating from them; a monster, a hybrid, &c.

Lastly, when we were discussing the efficient causes of the foetus, we were not inattentive to its admirable structure, to the functions and uses of all its parts and members; neither did we overlook the foresight, the art, the intelligence, the divine inspiration with which all things were ordained and skilfully continued for the ends of life. It is not enough that we inquire what is the “efficient,” the architect, the adviser, but that we likewise venerate and adore the omnipotent Creator and preserver of a work, which has been well entitled a microcosm. We also ask whence this divine something comes, when it arrives, and where it resides in the egg; this something which is analogous to the essence of the stars, and is near akin to art and intelligence, and the vicar of the Almighty Creator.

From what precedes it will be apparent how difficult it were to enumerate all the efficient causes of the chick; it is indispensable, indeed, in the complete investigation of this subject to refer to a general disquisition; we could not from the single generation of the chick *in ovo*, and without clearer light derived from investigations extended to other animals, venture on conclusions that should be applicable to the whole animal creation. And this all the more, since Aristotle himself has enumerated such a variety of efficient principles of animals; for he at one time adduces the “male” [2] as the principal efficient cause, as that, to wit, in which the reason of the engendered chick resides, according to the axiom: “all things are made by the same ‘univocal’ ”; [3] at another time he takes “the male semen” or, “the nature of the male emitting semen” [4]; sometimes it is “that which inheres in the semen, which causes seeds to be prolific, spirit, to wit, and nature in that spirit corresponding in its qualities to the essence of the stars”; [5] elsewhere he says it is “heat”; [6] “moderate heat”; [7] “a certain and proportionate degree of heat”; [8] “the heat in the blood”; [9] “the heat of the ambient air”; “the winds”; [10] “the sun”; “the heavens”; “Jupiter”; “the soul”; and, somewhere, nature is spoken of by him as “the principle of motion and rest.”

Aristotle concludes the discussion on the efficient cause by declaring it “extremely doubtful” whether it be “anything extrinsic; or something inherent in the geniture or semen; and whether it be any part of the soul, or the soul itself, or something having a soul?” [11]

To escape from such a labyrinth of “efficient causes,” it were necessary to be furnished with Ariadne's thread, composed from observations on almost every animal that lives; on this account the subject is deferred till we come to our more general disquisition. Meantime we shall recount the particulars which either manifestly appear in the special history of the chick from the egg, or which differ from the ideas usually entertained, or that seem to demand further inquiry.

### EXERCISE 47. Of the manner in which the efficient cause of the chick acts, according to Aristotle

It is universally allowed, that the male is the primary efficient cause in generation, on the ground that in him the species or form resides; and it is further affirmed, that the emission of his “geniture” during coition, is the cause both of the existence and the fertility of the egg. But none of the philosophers nor physicians, ancient or modern, have sufficiently explained in what manner the seed of the cock produced a chick from the egg; nor have they solved the question proposed by Aristotle. Nor, indeed, is Aristotle himself much more explanatory, when he says:
> “that the male contributes not in respect of quantity, but of quality, and is the origin of action; but that it is the female which brings the material.”
And a little after:
> “It is not every male that emits seed, and in those which do so, this is no part of the foetus; just as in the case of a carpenter, nothing is translated from him to the substance of the wood which he uses, nor does any part of the artist’s skill reside in the work when completed; but a form and appearance are given by his operation to the matter; and the soul, which originates the idea of forms, and the skill to imitate them, moves the hands, or other limb, whatever it may be, by a motion of a certain quality; or from diversity proceeds difference; or from similarity proceeds resemblance. But the hands and instruments move the material. So the nature of a male, which emits semen, uses that semen as an instrument, and an act having motion; as in works of art the instruments are moved, for in them, in some sort, the motion of the art exists.”

By these words he seems to imply that generation is owing to the motion of a certain quality. Just as in art, though the first cause (*the ratio operis*) be in the mind of the artist, yet afterwards, the work is effected by the movement of the hands or other instruments; and although the first cause be removed (as in automatons), yet is it in some sort said to move what it now does not touch, but once has touched, so long as motion continues in the instrument.

Also in the next book, he says:
> “When the semen of the male has arrived as far as the uterus of the female, it arranges and coagulates the purest part of the excrement (meaning the menstrual blood existing in the uterus); and, by a motion of this kind, changes the material, which has been prepared in the uterus, till it forms part of the chick; and this, hereafter, although the semen after the performance of this motion disappears, exists as part of the foetus, and becomes animate (as the heart) and regulates its own powers and growth, as a son emancipated from his father, and having his own establishment. And so it is necessary that there be some commencing principle, from which afterwards the order of the limbs may be delineated, and a proper disposition made of those things that concern the absolution of the animal; a principle, which may be the source of growth and motion to all the other parts; the origin of all, both similar and dissimilar parts, and the source of their ultimate aliment. For that which is already an animal grows, but the ultimate aliment of an animal is the blood, or something corresponding to the blood, whose vessels and receptacles are the veins; wherefore, the heart is the origin of the veins. But veins, like roots, spread to the uterus, and through these the foetus derives its nourishment. The heart too, being the beginning of all nature and the containing end, ought to be made first; as if it were a genital part by its own nature, which, as the original of all the other parts, and of the whole animal, and of sense, must needs be the first; and by its heat (since all the parts are in the material potentially), when once the beginning of the motion has taken place, all that follows is excited, just as in spontaneous miracles; and the parts are commenced, not by change of place, but by alteration in softness, hardness, temperature, and the other differences observed in similar parts, these being now actually made, which had before existed only potentially.”

This is, in nearly so many words, the opinion of Aristotle, which supposes that the foetus is formed from the seed by motion, although it is not at present in communication with the foetus, but simply has been so at a former time: his reasonings are, indeed, ingenious, and carefully put together, and from what we see in the order of the generation of parts, not improbable. For the heart, with the channel of the veins, is first noticed as an animate principle, in which motion and sense reside; or, as it were, an emancipated son, and a genital part, whence the order of the members is delineated, whence all things pertaining to the completion of the animal are disposed, and which has all the attributes bestowed upon it by Aristotle.

But it seems impossible that the heart should be formed in the egg by the seed of the male, when that seed neither exists in the egg, nor touches it, nor ever has touched it; because the seed does not enter the uterus where the egg is (as is allowed by Fabricius), nor is in any way attracted by it; nay, even the maternal blood is not in the egg, nor any other prepared matter, out of which the seed of the male may form this genital part, the author of all the others. For it is not immediately after coition, while the seed still remains within the body, and is in communication, that any part of the chick exists in the egg, but after many days, when incubation has taken place. Moreover, in fishes, when the geniture of the male does nothing but touch the eggs externally, and does not enter into them, it is not likely that it performs any more ample functions when the agency is external, than does the seed of the cock in the already formed eggs of the hen. Besides, since immediately after coition no trace of the egg as yet exists, but it is afterwards generated by the hen herself (I am speaking of the prolific egg); when now the seed of the cock is departed and vanished, there is no probability that the foetus is formed in that egg by the aforesaid seed, through means of one or any number of successive motions.

Nor indeed does the difference between prolific and unprolific or wind eggs consist herein, that the former contained the seed of the male, as Aldrovandus supposed; nor has it been noticed that anything has been formed and coagulated in the egg by the seed of the male, nor has any sensible transmutation been discovered (for indeed, there is no sensible difference between the fertile and the wind egg); and yet a prolific egg, conceived long after coition, has in itself the faculties of both sexes; viz., the capability of being both formed itself, and of forming a chick; as if, according to the idea of Aristotle, it had derived its origin from the coition of the two, and their mutual endeavours towards the same end; and compelled by the force of this argument, as mentioned above, when speaking of the generation of the *ovum*, he has endowed the egg with a vital principle (*anima*). If such really exist, then, without doubt it would be the origin and efficient of all the natural phenomena which take place in the egg. For if we consider the structure of the chick, displaying, as it does, so much art, so divine an intelligence and foresight; when we see the eyes adapted for vision, the bill for taking food, the feet for walking, the wings for flying, and similarly the rest of its parts, each to its own end, we must conclude, whatever the power be which creates such an animal out of an egg, that it is either the soul, or part of the soul, or something having a soul, or something existing previous to, and more excellent than the soul, operating with intelligence and foresight.

From the generation of the chick, it is also manifest that, whatever may have been its principle of life or first vegetative cause, this cause itself first existed in the heart. Now, if this be the soul of the chicken, it is equally clear that that soul must have existed in the *punctum saliens* and the blood; since we there discover motion and sense; for the heart moves and leaps like an animal. But if a soul exists in the *punctum saliens*, forming, nourishing, and augmenting the rest of the body, in the manner which we have pointed out in our history, then it, without doubt, flows from the heart, as from a fountain-head, into the whole body. Likewise, if the existence of the vital principle (*anima*) in the egg, or, as Aristotle supposes, if the vegetative part of the soul be the cause of its fertility, it must follow that the *punctum saliens*, or animate genital part, proceeds from the vital principle (*anima*) of the egg (for nothing is its own author), and that the said vital principle (*anima*) passes from the egg into the *punctum saliens*, presently into the heart, and thence into the chick.

Moreover, if the egg have a prolific virtue, and a vegetative soul, by which the chick is constructed, and if it owe them, as is allowed on all hands, to the *semen* of the cock; it is clear that this *semen* is also endowed with an active principle (*anima*). For such is Aristotle’s opinion, when he expresses himself as follows:
> “As to whether the semen has a vital principle (*anima*) or not, the same reasoning must be adduced which we have employed in the consideration of other parts. For no active principle (*anima*) can exist, except in that thing whose vital principle it is; nor can there be any part which is not partaker of the vital principle, except it be equivocally, as the eye of a dead man. We must, therefore, allow, both that the semen has an active principle (*anima*) and is potential.”

Now from these premises, it follows that the male is the primary efficient in which the *ratio* and *forma* reside, which produces a seed or rather a prolific geniture, and imparts it, imbued as it is with an *anima vegetativa* (with which also the rest of its parts are endowed) to the female. The introduction of this geniture begets such a movement in the material of the hen, that the production of an animate egg is the result, and from thence too the first particle of the chick is animated, and afterwards the whole chick. And so, according to Aristotle, either the same soul passes, by means of some *metempsychosis*, from the cock into his geniture, from the geniture into the material of the female, thence into the egg, and from the egg into the chick; or else, it is raised up in each of the subsequent things by its respective antecedent; namely, in the seed of the male by the male himself, in the egg by the seed, last in the chick by the egg, as light is derived from light.

The efficient, therefore, which we look for in the egg, to explain the birth of the chick, is the vital principle (*anima*); and therefore, the vital principle of the egg; for, according to Aristotle, a soul does not exist except in that thing whose soul it is.

But it is manifest that the seed of the male is not the efficient of the chick; neither as an instrument capable of forming the chick by its motion, as Aristotle would have it, nor as an animate substance transferring its vitality (*anima*) to the chick. For in the egg there is no *semen*, neither does any touch it, nor has ever done so:
> “and it is impossible that that which does not touch should move, or that anything should be affected by that which does not move it”;
and therefore the vitality of the *semen* ought not to be said to exist in it; and although the vital principle may be the efficient in the egg, yet it would not appear to result more from the cock or his *semen*, than from the hen.

Nor, indeed, is it transferred by any *metempsychosis* or translation from the cock and his *semen* into the egg, and thence into the chick. For how can this translation be carried on into the eggs that are yet to exist, and to be conceived after intercourse? unless either some animate *semen* be in the mean time working in some part of the hen; or the vital principle only have been translated without the seed, in order to be infused into any egg which might thereafter be produced; but neither of these alternatives is true. For in no part of the hen is the *semen* to be found; nor is it possible that the hen after coition should be possessed of a double vital principle, to wit, her own, and that of the future eggs and chicks; since:
> “the living principle or soul is said to be nowhere but in that thing whose soul it is,”
much less can one or more vital principles lie hidden in the hen, to be afterwards subservient to the future eggs and chicks in their order, as they are produced.

We have adduced these passages out of Aristotle in order to set forth his opinion of the manner in which the seed of the cock produces the chick from the egg; and thereby throw at least some light on this difficult question. But whereas the said passages do not explain the mode in which this is accomplished, nor even solve the doubts proposed by himself, it appears that we are still sticking in the same mud, and caught in the same perplexities (concerning the efficient cause of the foetus in the generation of animals); indeed, so far from Aristotle’s arguments rendering this question more clear, they appear on the contrary to involve it in more and greater doubts.

Wherefore it is no wonder that the most excellent philosopher was in perplexity on this head, and that he has admitted so great a variety of efficient causes, and at one time has been compelled to resort to automatons, coagulation, art, instruments, and motions, for illustrations; at another time to an *anima* in the egg, and in the seed of the male. Moreover, when he seems positively and definitively to determine what it is in each seed, whether of plants or animals, which render the same fertile, he repudiates heat and fire as improper agents; nor does he admit any faculty of a similar quality; nor can he find anything in the seed which should be fit for that office; but he is driven to acknowledge something incorporeal, and coming from foreign sources, which he supposes (like art, or the mind) to form the foetus with intelligence and foresight, and to institute and ordain all its parts for its welfare. He takes refuge, I say, in a thing which is obscure and not recognizable by us; namely, in a spirit contained in the seed, and in a frothy body, and in the nature in that spirit, corresponding in proportion to the elements of the stars. But what that is, he has nowhere informed us.

### EXERCISE 48. The opinion of Fabricius on the efficient cause of the chick is refuted

As I have chosen Aristotle, the most eminent among the ancient philosophers, and Fabricius of Aquapendente, one of the foremost anatomists of modern times, as my especial guides and sources of information on the subject of animal generation, when I find that I can make nothing of Aristotle upon a particular topic, I straightway turn to Fabricius; and now I desire to know what he thought of the efficient cause of generation.

I find that he endeavours to satisfy three doubts or difficulties involved in this subject: First, What is the “efficient” of the chick? This he answers, by saying, the *semen* of the male. Secondly, How does this appear in the egg, and in what way does the *semen* of the cock fecundate the egg? Thirdly and lastly, In what order are the parts of the chick engendered?

As to the first query, it appears from our observations, that the cock and his seminal fluid are verily the “efficient,” but not the “adequate” cause of generation; that the hen comes in here as something. In this place, therefore, we are principally to inquire how the *semen* of the cock fecundates the egg otherwise unprolific, and secures the engenderment of a chick from it?

But let us hear Fabricius:
> “Those things differ,” he observes, “that are produced from eggs, from those that originate from semen, in this, that oviparous animals have the matter from which the embryo is incorporated distinct and separate from the agent; whilst viviparous animals have the efficient cause and the matter associate and concorpórate. For the ‘agent’ in the oviparous animal is the *semen* of the male, in the fowl the *semen* of the cock, which neither is nor can be in the egg; the ‘matter,’ again, is the *chalazae* from which the foetus is incorporated. These two differ widely from one another; for the *chalazae* are added after the *vitellus* is formed, whilst it is passing through the second uterus, and are an accession to the internal egg; the *semen galli*, on the contrary, is stored near the fundament, is separated from the *chalazae* by a great interval, and nevertheless by its irradiating faculty, fecundates both the whole egg and the uterus. Now in the viviparous animal, the *semen* is both ‘matter’ and ‘agent,’ the two consisting and being conjoined in the same body.” [12]

Our author appears to have introduced this distinction between oviparous and viviparous animals, that he might spare, or at all events, that he might not directly shock or upset the notions of medical writers on the generation of man, they teaching that the seminal fluids of either sex, projected together in intercourse, are mingled; that as one or other preponderates, this becomes the “efficient,” that stands in lieu of the “matter”; and that the two together, tending to the same end, amalgamate into the “conception” of the viviparous animal.

But when he finds that neither in the egg nor uterus of the fowl is there any *semen* or blood, and avows his belief that nothing is emitted by the male in intercourse, that can by possibility reach the uterus of the female, nor in the egg discovers a trace of aught supplied by the male, he is compelled to doubt how the *semen*, which is nowhere to be detected, which is neither mixed with the “geniture” of the female, nor yet is added to it, nor touches it, can fecundate the egg, or constitute the chick. And this all the more urgently, when he has stated that a few connections in the beginning of the season suffice to secure the fecundity of all the eggs that will be laid in its course. For how should it seem otherwise than impossible that from the *semen galli* communicated in the spring, but now long vanished, lost or consumed, the eggs that continue to be laid through the summer and autumn, should still be rendered fruitful and fit to produce pullets?

It is that he may meet such a difficulty halfway, that he coins the difference which has been noticed. By way of bolstering up his views, he further adduces three additional considerations: First, since the *semen galli* is neither extant in the egg, nor was ever present in the uterus, nor is added as “material cause” as in viviparous animals, he has chosen to make it resident for a whole year in the body of the hen. And then that he may have a fit receptacle or storehouse for the fecundating fluid, he finds a blind sac near the inlet to the uterus, in which he says the cock deposits his *semen*, wherein, as in a treasury, it is stored, and from which all the eggs are fecundated. Lastly, although the *semen* in that *bursa* comes into contact neither with the uterus, nor the egg, nor the ovary, whereby it might fecundate the egg, or secure the generation of a chick, he says, nevertheless, that from thence, a certain spiritual substance or irradiation penetrates to the egg, fecundates its *chalazae*, and from these produces a chick. By this affirmation, however, he appears to support the opinion of Aristotle, namely, that the female supplies the “matter” in generation, the male the “efficient force”; and to oppose the postulate of medical writers about the mixture of seminal fluids, for the sake of which, nevertheless, as I have said, he seems to have laid down his distinction between oviparous and viviparous animals. To give an air of greater likelihood to this notion of his, he goes on to enumerate the changes which the *semen*, not yet emitted, but laid up in the testes and *vesiculae seminales* of animals, occasions.

But besides the fact that all this does not bear upon the question, for the principal element under discussion is, not how the *semen galli* renders the egg prolific, but rather, how does the *semen galli* fashion and construct the chick from the egg? Almost everything he adduces in support of his view appears either

# ANIMAL GENERATION

false or open to suspicion, as is obvious, from the facts stated in our history; for neither is the blind cavity situated at the root of the uropygium or coccyx of the fowl, which he entitles “bursa,” destined as a receptacle for the *semen* of the cock, nor can any *semen* be discovered there, as we have said; but the cavity is encountered in the male as well as in the female fowl.

Our authority nowhere explains what he understands by a “spiritual substance,” and an “irradiation”; nor what he means by “a substance through whose virtue the egg is vivified”: he does not say whether it is any “corporeal” or “formal” substance, which by “irradiation” proceeds from the *semen* laid up in the bursa, and (what is especially required) constructs a pullet from the egg.

In my opinion, Fabricius does no more here than say: “It produces the chick because it irradiates the egg; and forms because it vivifies”; he attempts to explain or illustrate the exceedingly obscure subject of the formation of a living being by means still more obscure. For the same doubt remains untouched, how, to wit, the *semen* of the cock without contact, an “external efficient” at best, separate in point of place, and existing in the bursa, can form the internal parts of the *foetus in ovo*, the heart, liver, lungs, intestines, &c., out of the chalazae by “irradiation.” Unless, indeed, our author will have it that all takes place at the dictum as it were of a creator seated on his throne, and speaking the words: Let such things be! namely, bones for support, muscles for motion, special organs for sense, members for action, viscera for concoction and the like, and all ordered for an end and purpose with foresight, and understanding and art. But Fabricius nowhere demonstrates that the *semen* has any such virtue, nowhere explains the manner in which without so much as contact the *semen* can effect such things; particularly when we see that the egg incubated by a bird of another kind than that which laid it, or cherished in any other way, or in dung, or in an oven, far from the bursa of the parent hen, is still quickened and made to produce an embryo.

be the less deeply immersed in the difficulty of accounting for the formation of all the internal parts of the chick. But these notions have already been sufficiently refuted by us.

Wherefore, in investigating the efficient cause of the chick, we must look for it as inhering in the egg, not as concealed in the bursa; and it must be such, that although the egg have long been laid, be miles removed from the hen that produced it, and be set under another hen than its parent, even under a bird of a different kind, such as a turkey or guinea-fowl, or merely among hot sand or dung, or in an oven constructed for the purpose, as is done in Egypt, it will still cause the egg to produce a creature of the same species as its parents, like them, both male and female, and if the parents were of different kinds, of a hybrid species, and having a mixed resemblance.

The knot therefore remains untied, neither Aristotle nor Fabricius having succeeded even in loosening it, namely: how the *semen* of the male or of the cock forms a pullet from an egg, or is to be termed the “efficient” of the chick, especially when it is neither present in, nor in contact with, nor added to the egg. And although almost all assert that the male and his *semen* are the efficient cause of the chick, still it must be admitted, that no one has yet sufficiently explained how it is so, particularly in our common hen’s egg.

## EXERCISE 49. The inquiry into the efficient cause of the chick is one of great difficulty

The discussion of the efficient cause of the chick is, as we have said, sufficiently difficult, and all the more in consequence of the various titles by which it has been designated. Aristotle, indeed, recites several efficient causes of animals, and numerous controversies have arisen on the subject among writers (these having been particularly hot between medical authors and Aristotelians) who have come into the arena with various explanations, both of the nature of the efficient cause and of the mode of its operation.

And indeed the Omnipotent Creator is nowhere more conspicuous in his works, nowhere is his divinity more loudly proclaimed, than in the structure of animals. And though all know and admit that the offspring derives its origin from male and female, that an egg is engendered by a cock and a hen, and that a pullet proceeds from an egg, still we are not informed either by the medical schools or the sagacious Aristotle, as to the manner in which the cock or his *semen* fashions the chick from the egg. For from what we have had occasion to say of the generation of oviparous and other animals, it is sufficiently obvious that neither is the opinion of the medical authorities admissible, who derive generation from the admixture of the seminal fluids of the two sexes, nor that of Aristotle, who holds the *semen masculinum* for the efficient, and the menstrual blood for the material cause of procreation. For neither in the act of intercourse nor shortly after it, is aught transferred to the cavity of the uterus, from which as matter any part of the *foetus* is immediately constituted. Neither does the “*geniture*” proceeding from the male in the act of union (whether it be animated or an inanimate instrument) enter the uterus; neither is it attracted into this organ; neither is it stored up within the fowl; but it is either dissipated or escapes. Neither is there anything contained in the uterus immediately after intercourse, which, proceeding from the male, or from the female, or from both, can be regarded as the matter or rudiment of the future *foetus*. Neither is the *semen galli* stored and retained in the *bursa Fabricii* of the hen or elsewhere, that from thence, as by the irradiation of some spiritual substance, or by contact, the egg may be fashioned or the chick constituted from the egg. Neither has the hen any other *semen* save *papulae*, yelks, and eggs. These observations of ours, therefore, render the subject of generation one of greater difficulty than ever, inasmuch as all the presumptions upon which the two old opinions repose are totally overthrown. The fact is especially, as we shall afterwards demonstrate, that all animals are alike engendered from eggs; and in the act of intercourse, whether of man or the lower quadrupeds, there is no seminal fluid, proceeding from the male or the female, thrown into the uterus or attracted by this organ; there is nothing to be discovered within its cavity, either before intercourse, during the act, or immediately after it, which can be regarded as the matter of the future *foetus*, or as its efficient cause, or as its commencement.

Daniel Sennert, a man of learning and a close observer of nature, having first passed the reasonings of a host of others under review, approaches the subject himself; and concludes that the vital principle inheres in the *semen* and is almost identical with that which resides in the future offspring. So that Sennert does not hesitate to aver that the rational soul of man is present in his seminal fluid, and by a parity of reasoning that the egg possesses the animating principle of the pullet; that the vital principle is transported to the uterus of the female with the *semen* of the male, and that from the seminal fluids of either conjoined, not mixed (for mixture, he says, is applied to things of different species), and endowed with soul or the vital principle a perfect animal emerges. And therefore, he says, the *semen* of either parent is required, whether to the constitution of the *ovum* or of the embryo. And having said so much, he seems to think that he has overcome all difficulties, and has delivered a certain and perspicuous truth.

But in order that we should concede a soul or vital principle (*anima*) to the egg, and that combined from the souls of the parents, these being occasionally of different species, the horse and the ass, the common fowl and the pheasant, for example, this vital principle not being a mixture but only a union; and allow the pullet to be produced in the manner of the seeds of plants, by the same efficient principle by which the perfect animal is afterwards preserved through the rest of its life, so that it would be absurd to say that the *foetus* grew by one vital principle without the uterus or *ovum*, and by another within the uterus or *ovum* — did we grant all this, I say (although it is invalid and undeserving faith), our history of generation from the egg, nevertheless, upsets the foundations of the doctrine, and shows it to be entirely false; namely, that the egg is produced from the *semen* of the cock and hen, or that any seminal fluid from either one or other is carried to the uterus, or that the embryo or any particle of it is fashioned from any seminal fluid transported to the uterus, or that the *semen galli*, as efficient cause and plastic agent, is anywhere stored up or reserved within the body of the hen to serve when attracted into the uterus, as the matter and nourishment whence the *foetus* which it has produced should continue to grow. The conditions are wanting which he himself admits, after Aristotle, to be necessary, viz., that the embryo be constituted by that which is actual and pre-exists, and the chick by that which is present and exists in the place where the chick is first formed and increases; further, that it be produced by that which is accomplished immediately and conjunctly, and is the same by which the chick is preserved and grows through the whole of its life. For the *semen galli* (and whether it is viewed as animate or inanimate is of no moment) is nowise present and conjunct either in the egg or in the uterus; neither in the matter from which the chick is fashioned, nor yet in the chick itself already begun, and as contributing either to its formation or perfection.

He dreams, too, when he seeks illustrations of his opinions on an animated *semen* from such instances as the seeds of plants and acorns; because he does not perceive the difference alleged by Aristotle[^1] between the “*geniture*” admitted in intercourse and the first conception engendered by both parents; neither does he observe on the egg produced originally in the cluster of the vitellarium, and without any *geniture*, whether proceeding from the male or the female, translated to the uterus. Neither does he understand that the uterus is, even after intercourse, completely empty of matter of every kind, whether transmitted by the parents, or produced by the intercourse, or transmuted in any way whatever. Neither had he read, or at all events he does not refer to the experiment of Fabricius, namely, that a hen is rendered so prolific by a few treads of the cock, that she will continue to lay fruitful eggs for the rest of the year, although in the interval she receives no new accessions of *semen* for the fecundation of each egg as it is laid, neither does she retain any of the seminal fluid which she received so long ago.

So much is certain, and disputed by no one, that animals, all those at least that proceed from the intercourse of male and female, are the offspring of this intercourse, and that they are procreated as it seems by a kind of contagion, much in the same way as medical men observe contagious diseases, such as leprosy, *lues venera*, plague, phthisis, to creep through the ranks of mortal men, and by mere extrinsic contact to excite diseases similar to themselves in other bodies; nay, contact is not necessary; a mere *halitus* or miasm suffices, and that at a distance and by an inanimate medium, and with nothing sensibly altered: that is to say, where the contagion first touches, there it generates an “*univocal*” like itself, neither touching nor existing in fact, neither being present nor conjunct, but solely because it formerly touched. Such virtue and efficacy is found in contagions. And the same thing perchance occurs in the generation of animals. For the eggs of fishes, which come spontaneously to their full size extrinsically, and without any addition of male seminal fluid, and are therefore indubitably possessed of vitality without it, merely sprinkled and touched with the milt of the male, produce young fishes.

The *semen* of the male, I say, is not intromitted in such wise as to perform the part of “agent” in each particular egg, or to fashion the body, or to introduce vitality (*anima*); the *ova* are only fecundated by a kind of contagion. Whence Aristotle calls the milt of the male fish, or the genital fluid diffused in water, at one time “the genital and foetific fluid,” at another, “the vital virus.” For he says:
> “The male fish sprinkles the *ova* with his genital *semen*, and from the *ova* that are touched by this vital virus young fishes are engendered.”[^2]

Let it then be admitted as matter of certainty that the embryo is produced by contagion. But a great difficulty immediately arises, when we ask: how, in what way is this contagion the author of so great a work? By what condition do parents through it engender offspring like themselves, or how does the *semen masculinum* produce an “*univocal*” like the male whence it flowed? When it disappears after the contact, and is naught in act ulteriorly, either by virtue of contact or presence, but is corrupt and has become a nonentity, how, I ask, does a nonentity act? How does a thing which is not in contact fashion another thing like itself? How does a thing which is dead itself impart life to something else, and that only because at a former period it was in contact?

For the reasoning of Aristotle appears to be false, or at all events defective, where he contends:
> “That generation cannot take place without an active and a passive principle; and that those things can neither act nor prove passive which do not touch; but that those things come into mutual contact which, whilst they are of different sizes, and are in different places, have their extremes together.”[^3]

But when it clearly appears that contagion from noncontingents, and things not having their extremities together, produce ill effects on animals, wherefore should not the same law avail in respect of their life and generation? There is an “efficient” in the egg which, by its plastic virtue (for the male has only touched though he no longer touches, nor are there any extremes together), produces and fashions the *foetus* in its kind and likeness. And through so many media or instruments is this power, the agent of fecundity, transmitted or required that neither by any movement of instruments as in works of art, nor by the instance of the automaton quoted by Aristotle, nor of our clocks, nor of the kingdom in which the mandate of the sovereign is everywhere of avail, nor yet by the introduction of a vital principle or soul into the *semen* or “*geniture*,” can the aforementioned doctrine be defended.

And hence have arisen all the controversies and problems concerning the attraction of the magnet and of amber; on sympathy and antipathy; on poisons and the contagion of pestilential diseases; on alexipharmics and medicines which prove curative or injurious through some hidden or rather unknown property, all of which seem to come into play independently of contact. And above all on what it is in generation which, in virtue of a momentary contact — nay, not even of contact, save through several media — forms the parts of the chick from the egg by epigenesis in a certain order, and produces an “*univocal*” and like itself, and that entirely because it was in contact at a former period. How, I ask again, does that which is not present, and which only enjoyed extrinsic contact, come to constitute and order all the members of the chick in the egg exposed without the body of the parent, and often at a long interval after it is laid? how does it confer life or soul, and a species compounded of those of the concurring generants? Inasmuch as nothing, it seems, can reproduce itself in another’s likeness.

## EXERCISE 50. Of the efficient cause of animals, and its conditions

That we may proceed in our subject, therefore, and penetrate so far into the knowledge of the efficient cause of animal generation as seems needful in this place, we must begin by observing what instruments or media are devoted to it. And here we come at once to the distinction into male and female; seminal fluid and *ovum*, and its primordium. For some males, as well as some females, are barren, or but little prolific; and the seed of the male is at one time more, at another time less prolific; because the *semen masculinum* stored up in the *vesiculae seminales* is esteemed unfruitful, unless it is raised into froth by the spirits and ejected with force. And even then perchance it is not endowed with equal fecundating force at all times. Neither are all the germs of yelks in the ovary, nor all the eggs in the uterus made fertile at the same instant.

Now I call that fruitful which, unless impeded by some extrinsic cause, attains by its inherent force to its destined end, and brings about the consequence for the sake of which it is ordained. Thus the cock is called fruitful which has his hens more frequently and surely pregnant, the eggs they lay being at the same time perfect and proper for incubation.

The hen in like manner is esteemed fruitful which has the faculty of producing eggs, or of receiving and long retaining the virtue of prolific conception from the cock. The cluster of germs and the ovary itself are regarded as prolific when the germs are numerous and of good size.

The egg in the same way is fruitful which differs from a *subventaneous* or *hypenemic* egg, and which, cherished by incubation, or in any other way, does not fail to produce a chick.

Such an efficient cause consequently is required for the chick, as shall impart the virtue of fecundity to it, and secure it the power of acting as an efficient cause in its turn. Because that, or its analogue at least, by means of which they become prolific, is present in all animals. And the inquiry is the same in each case, when we ask what it is in the egg which renders it prolific, and distinguishes it from a wind egg; what in the vitellary germ and ovary; what in the female; what, finally, in the *semen* and the cock himself? What, moreover, it is in the blood and *punctum saliens*, or first formed particle of the chick, whence all the other parts arise with their appropriate structures and arrangements; what in the embryo or chick itself whereby it becomes more or less robust and agile, attains to maturity with greater or less rapidity, and lives with various degrees of health, for a longer or shorter period?

Nor is the inquiry very different which goes to ascertain what sex the male and the female, or the cock and the hen, confer upon the prolific egg; and what proceeds from each that contributes to the perfection or resemblance of the chick, viz., whether the egg, the conception, the matter, and the nutriment proceed from the mother, and the plastic virtue from the father; or rather a certain contagion immitted during intercourse, or produced and received from him, which in the body of the hen, or in the eggs, either permanently excites the matter of the eggs, or attracts nourishment from the female, and concocts and distributes it first for the growth of the eggs, and then for the production of the chicks; finally, whether from the male proceeds all that has reference to form and life and fecundity, from the female, again, all that is of matter, constitution, place, and nourishment? For among animals where the sexes are distinct, matters are so arranged, that since the female alone is inadequate to engender an embryo and to nourish and protect the young, a male is associated with her by nature, as the superior and more worthy progenitor, as the consort of her labour, and the means of supplying her deficiencies; in the case of the hen, of correcting by his contagion the inferiority of the *hypenemic* eggs which she produces, and so rendering them prolific. For as the pullet, engendered of an egg, is indebted to that egg for his body, vitality, and principal or generative part, so and in like manner does the egg receive all that is in it from the female, the female in her turn being dependent on the male for her fecundity which is conferred in coition.

And here we have an opportunity of inquiring, whether the male be the first and principal cause of the generation of the offspring; or whether the male along with the female are the mediate and instrumental causes of nature itself, or of the first and supreme generator? And such an inquiry is both becoming and necessary, for perfect science of every kind depends on a knowledge of causes. To the full understanding of generation, therefore, it is incumbent on us to mount from the final to the first and supreme efficient cause, and to hold each and every cause in especially regard.

We shall have occasion to define that which is the first and supreme efficient cause of the chick *in ovo* by and by, when we treat of that which constitutes the efficient cause among animals in general. Here, meantime, we shall see what its nature may be.

The first condition, then, of the primary efficient cause of generation, properly so called, is, as we have said, that it be the prime and principal fertilizer, whence all mediate causes receive the fecundity imparted. For example, the chick is derived from the *punctum saliens* in the egg, not only as regards the body, but also, and this especially, as respects the life (*anima*): the *punctum saliens*, or heart, is derived from the egg, the egg from the hen, and the hen has her fecundity from the cock.

Another condition of the prime efficient is discovered from the work achieved, viz., the chick, because that is the prime efficient in which the reason of the effect is principally displayed. But since every generative efficient engenders another like itself, and the offspring is of a mixed nature, the prime efficient must also be a certain mixed something.

Now, I maintain that the offspring is of a mixed nature, inasmuch as a mixture of both parents appears plainly in it, in the form and lineaments, and each particular part of its body, in its colour, mother-marks, disposition to diseases, and other accidents. In mental constitution, also, and its manifestations, such as manners, docility, voice, and gait, a similar temperament is discoverable. For as we say of a certain mixture, that it is composed of elements, because their qualities or virtues, such as heat, cold, dryness, and moisture, are there discovered associated in a certain similar compound body, so, in like manner, the work of the father and mother is to be discerned both in the body and mental character of the offspring, and in all else that follows or accompanies temperament. In the mule, for instance, the body and disposition, the temper and voice, of both parents (of the horse and the ass, e. g.) are mingled; and so, also, in the hybrid between the pheasant and the fowl, in that between the wolf and the dog, &c., corresponding traits are conspicuous.

When, therefore, the chick shows his resemblance to both parents, and is a mixed effect, the primary genital cause (which it resembles) must needs be mixed. Wherefore that which fashions the chick in the egg is of a mixed nature, a certain something mixed or compounded, and the work of both parents. And if any kind of contagion, engendered under the influence of sexual intercourse, in which the male and female mingle and form but one body, either originates or remains in the body of the female, that, too, must be of a mixed nature or power, whence, subsequently, a fertile egg will be produced, endowed with plastic powers, the consequence of a mixed nature, or of a mixed efficient instrument, from which a chick, also of a mixed nature, will be produced.

I have used the word contagion above, because Aristotle’s view is contradicted by all experience, that a certain part of the embryo is immediately made by intercourse. Neither is it true, as some of the moderns assert, that the vital principle (*anima*) of the future chick is present in the egg; for that cannot be the vital principle of the chick which inheres in no part of its body. Neither can the living principle be said either to be left or to be originated by intercourse; otherwise in every pregnant woman there would be two vital principles (*animae*) present. Wherefore, until it shall have been determined what the efficient cause of the egg is, what it is of mixed nature that must remain immediately upon intercourse, we may be permitted to speak of it under the title of a contagion.

But where this contagion lies hid in the female after intercourse, and how it is communicated and given to the egg, demands quite a special inquiry, and we shall have occasion to treat of the matter when we come to discuss the conception of females in general. It will suffice, meantime, if we say that the same law applies to the prime efficient — in which inheres the reason of the future offspring — as to the offspring; as this is of a mixed nature, the nature of its cause must also be mixed; and it must either proceed equally from both parents, or from something else which is employed by both concurrently as instruments, animated, co-operating, mixed, and in the sexual act coalescing unto one. And this is the third condition of the prime efficient, that it either imparts motion to all the intermediate instruments in succession, or uses them in some other way, but comes not itself into play. Whence the origin of the doubt that has arisen, whether, in the generation of the chick, the cock were the true prime efficient, or whether there were not another prior, superior to him? For, indeed, all things seem to derive their origin from a celestial influence, and to follow the movements of the sun and moon.

[^1]: *On the Generation of Animals*, ii, 1.
[^2]: *History of Animals*, vi, 13.
[^3]: *On Generation and Corruption*, i, 6.

But we shall be able to speak more positively of this matter after we have shown what we understand by the “instrument,” or “instrumental efficient cause,” and how it is subdivided.

Instrumental efficients, then, are of different kinds: some, according to Aristotle, are factive, others active; some have no capacity any way unless conjoined with another prior efficient, as the hand, foot, genital organs, &c. with the rest of the body; others have an influence even when separate and distinct, as the seminal fluid and the ovum. Some instruments, again, have neither motion nor action beyond those that are imparted to them by the prime efficient; and others have peculiar inherent principles of action, to which Nature indeed allows no motion in the business of generation, though she still uses their faculties, and prescribes them laws or limits in their operations, not otherwise than the cook makes use of fire in cooking, and the physician of herbs and drugs in curing diseases.

Sennert, that he may uphold the opinion he had espoused of the vital principle (*anima*) being present in the semen, and the formative faculty of the chick being extant in the egg, asserts that not only is the egg, but the semen of the cock, endowed with the living principle of the future chick. Moreover, he distinctly denies that there is any separate instrumental efficient; and says, that that only ought to be entitled “instrument” which is conjoined with the prime efficient; and that only “instrumental efficient,” which has no motion or action save that which is imparted to it by the prime efficient, or which is continuously and successively received, and in virtue of which it acts.

And on this ground he rejects the example of projectiles, which have received force from the projecting agent, and, separated from it, act nevertheless; as if swords and spears were properly to be called warlike weapons, but arrows and bullets to be refused this title. He also rejects the argument derived from the republic, denying thereby that magistrates, counsellors, or ministers, are instruments of government; although Aristotle regards a counsel as an efficient, and in express terms calls a minister an instrument (Aristotle, *Politics*, I. 4.). Sennert likewise denies the example of automata; and says and gainsays much besides, with a view to confirming himself in his position, that the semen and the egg are possessed of a living principle (*anima*), and are not mediate or instrumental, but principal agents.

Sennert, nevertheless, as it were compelled by the force of truth, lays down such conditions for a principal agent, as fully and effectually contradict all that he had said before. He tells us, for instance, that
> “whatever produces a work or an effect more noble than itself, or an effect unlike itself, is not a principal efficient, but an instrumental cause”;
granting which, who would not infer that the semen and the egg were instruments? seeing that the pullet is an effect more noble than the egg, and every way unlike either this or the spermatic fluid. Wherefore, when the learned Sennert denies the semen and the egg to be instruments or organs, because they are distinct from the prime agents, he takes his position upon a false basis; because, as the prime generator procreates offspring by various means or media, the medium being here conjunct, as the hand of the workman is with his body, there separate and distinct, as is the arrow let loose from the bow, it is still to be regarded as an instrument.

From the conditions now enumerated of an instrumental cause, it seems to follow that the prime efficient in the generation of the chick is the cock, or, at all events, the cock and hen, because the resulting pullet resembles these; nor can it be held more noble than they, which are its prime efficients or parents. I shall, therefore, add another condition of the prime efficient, whence it may, perhaps, appear that the male is not the prime, but only the instrumental, cause of the chick; viz., that the prime efficient in the formation of the chick makes use of artifice, and foresight, and wisdom, and goodness, and intelligence, which far surpass the powers of our rational soul to comprehend, inasmuch as all things are disposed and perfected in harmony with the purpose of the future work, and that there be action to a determinate end; so that every, even the smallest, part of the chick is fashioned for the sake of a special use and end, and with respect not merely to the rearing of the fabric, but also to its well-being, and elegance and preservation. But the male or his semen is not such either in the act of kind or after it, that art, intelligence, and foresight can be ascribed to him or it.

The proper inference from these premises appears to be that the male, as well as his seminal fluid is the efficient instrument; and the female not less than the egg she lays the same. Wherefore, we have to seek refuge in a prior, superior, and more excellent cause, to which, with all propriety, are ascribed foresight, intelligence, goodness, and skill, and which is by so much more excellent than its effect or work, as the architect is more worthy than the pile he rears, as the king is more exalted than his minister, as the workman is better than his hands or tools.

The male and female, therefore, will come to be regarded as merely the efficient instruments, subservient in all respects to the Supreme Creator, or Father of all things. In this sense, consequently, it is well said that the sun and moon engender man; because, with the advent and secession of the sun, come spring and autumn, seasons which mostly correspond with the generation and decay of animated beings. So that the great leader in philosophy says:
> “The first motion is not the cause of generation and destruction; it is the motion of the ecliptic that is so, this being both continuous and having two movements; for, if future generation and corruption are to be eternal, it is necessary that something likewise move eternally, that interchanges do not fail, that of the two actions one only do not occur. The cause of the perpetuity is, therefore, the law of the universe; and the obliquity is the cause of the approach and accession, and of his being now nearer, now more remote: when he quits us, and removes to a distance, it is then that decay and corruption intervene; and, in like manner, when he approaches, it is then that he engenders; and if, as he frequently approaches, he engenders; so, because he frequently recedes, does he cause corruption; for the causes of contraries are contrary.”
(*On Generation and Corruption*, ii. 10.)

All things, therefore, grow and flourish in spring (on the approach of the sun, that is to say, he being the common parent and producer, or at all events the immediate and universal instrument of the Creator in the work of reproduction); and this is true not of plants only but of animals also; nor less of those that come spontaneously, than of those that are propagated by the consentient act of male and female. It is as if, with the advent of this glorious luminary, Venus the bountiful descended from heaven, waited on by Cupid and a cohort of graces, and prompted all living things by the bland incitement of love to secure the perpetuity of their kinds. Or (and it is thus that we have it in the mythology) it is as if the genital organs of Saturn, cast into the sea at this season, raised a foam, whence sprung Aphrodite. For, in the generation of animals, as the poet says, *“superat tener omnibus humor,”—a* gentle moisture all pervades—and the genitals froth and are replete with semen.

The cock and the hen are especially fertile in the spring; as if the sun, or heaven, or nature, or the soul of the world, or the omnipotent God—for all these names signify the same thing—were a cause in generation superior and more divine than they; and thus it is that the sun and man, the sun through man as the instrument, engenders man. In the same way the preserver of all things, and the male among birds, give birth to the egg, from whence the chick, the perfect bird, is made eternal in its kind by the approach and recession of the god of day, who, by the Divine will and pleasure, or by fate, serves for the generation of all that lives.

Let us conclude, therefore, that the male, although a prior and more excellent efficient than the female, is still no more than an instrumental efficient, and that he, not less than the female, must refer his fecundity or faculty of engendering as received from the approaching sun; and, consequently, that the skill and foresight, which are apparent in his work, are not to be held as proceeding from him but from God; inasmuch as the male in the act of kind neither uses counsel nor understanding; neither does man engender the rational part of his soul, but only the vegetative faculty; which is not regarded as any principal or more divine faculty of the soul, but one only of a lower order.

Since, then, there is not less of skill and prescience manifested in the structure of the chick than in the creation of man and the universe at large, it is imperative even in the generation of man to admit an efficient cause, superior to, and more excellent than man himself: otherwise the vegetative faculty, or that part of the soul or living principle which fashions and preserves a man, would have to be accounted far more excellent and divine, and held to bear a closer resemblance to God than the rational portion of the soul, whose excellence, nevertheless, we extol over all the faculties of all animals, and esteem as that which has right and empire in them, and to which all created things are made subservient. Or we should else have to own that in the works of nature there was neither prudence, nor art, nor understanding; but that these appeared to us, who are wont to judge of the divine things of nature after our own poor arts and faculties, or to contrast them with examples due to ourselves; as if the active principles of nature produced their effects in the same way as we are used to produce our artificial works, by counsel, to wit, or discipline acquired through the mind or understanding.

But nature, the principle of motion and rest in all things in which it inheres, and the vegetative soul, the prime efficient cause of all generation, move by no acquired faculty which might be designated by the title of skill or foresight, as in our undertakings; but operate in conformity with determinate laws like fate or special commandments—in the same way and manner as light things rise and heavy things descend. The vegetative faculty of parents, to wit, engenders in the same way, and the semen finally arrives at the form of the foetus, as the spider weaves her web, as birds build nests, incubate their eggs, and cherish their young, or as bees and ants construct dwellings, and lay up stores for their future wants; all of which is done naturally and from a connate genius or disposition; by no means from forecast, instruction, or reason. That which in us is the principle or cause of artificial operations, and is called art, intellect, or foresight, in the natural operations of the lower animals is nature, which is *autodidaktos*, self-taught, instilled by no one; what in them is innate or connate, is with us acquired. On this account it is, that they who refer all to art and artifice are to be held indifferent judges of nature or natural things; and, indeed, it is wiser to act in the opposite way, and selecting standards in nature to judge of things made by art according to them. For all the arts are but imitations of nature in one way or another; as our reason or understanding is a derivative from the Divine intelligence, manifested in his works; and when perfected by habit, like another adventitious and acquired soul, gaining some semblance of the Supreme and Divine agent, it produces somewhat similar effects.

Wherefore, according to my opinion, he takes the right and pious view of the matter, who derives all generation from the same eternal and omnipotent Deity, on whose nod the universe itself depends. Nor do I think that we are greatly to dispute about the name by which this first agent is to be called or worshipped; whether it be God, Nature, or the Soul of the universe—whatever the name employed—all still intend by it that which is the beginning and the end of all things; which exists from eternity and is almighty; which is author or creator, and, by means of changing generations, the preserver and perpetuator of the fleeting things of mortal life; which is omnipresent, not less in the single and several operations of natural things, than in the infinite universe; which, by his deity or providence, his art and mind divine, engenders all things, whether they arise spontaneously without any adequate efficient, or are the work of male and female associated together, or of a single sex, or of other intermediate instruments, here more numerous, there fewer, whether they be univocal, or are equivocally or accidentally produced: all natural bodies are both the work and the instruments of that Supreme Good, some of them being mere natural bodies, such as heat, spirit, air, the temperature of the air, matters in putrefaction, &c., or they are at once natural and animated bodies; for he also makes use of the motions, or forces, or vital principles of animals in some certain way, to the perfection of the universe and the procreation of the several kinds of animated beings.

From what has now been said, we are apprised to a certain extent of the share which the male has in the business of generation. The cock confers that upon the egg, which, from unprolific, makes it prolific, this being identical with that which the fruit of vegetables receives from the fervour of the summer sun, which secures to them maturity, and to their seeds fertility; and not different from that which fertilizes things spontaneously engendered, and brings caterpillars from worms, aurelias from caterpillars, from aurelias moths, butterflies, bees, &c.

In this way is the sun, by his approach, both the beginning of motion and transmutation in the coming fruit, and the end, also, inasmuch as he is the author of the fertility of its included seed: and, as early spring is the prime efficient of leaves and flowers and fruits, so is summer, in its strength, the cause of final perfection in the ripeness and fecundity of the seed. With a view to strengthen this position, I shall add this one from among a large number of observations. Some persons in these countries cultivate orange trees with singular care and economy, and the fruit of these trees, which, in the course of the first year, will grow to the size of the point of the thumb, comes to maturity the following summer. This fruit is perfect in all respects, save and except that it is without pips or seeds.

Pondering upon this with myself, I thought that I had here an example of the barren egg, which is produced by the hen without the concurrence of the cock, and which comprises everything that is visible in a fruitful egg, but is still destitute of germinant seed; as if it were the same thing that was imparted by the cock, in virtue of which a wind egg becomes a fruitful egg, which in warmer countries is dispensed by the sun, and causes the fruit of the orange tree to be produced replete with prolific seed. It is as if the summer in England sufficed for the production of the fruit only, as the hen for the production of the egg, but like the female fowl was impotent as a pro-genetrix; whilst in other countries enjoying the sun’s light in larger proportion, the summer acquired the characters of the male, and perfected the work of generation.

Thus far have we treated this subject by the way, that, from the instance of the egg, we might learn what conditions were required in the prime efficient in the generation of animals; for it is certain that in the egg there is an agent, as there is also in every conception and germ, which is not merely infused by the mother, but is first communicated in *coitu* by the father, by means of his spermatic fluid; and which is itself primarily endowed with such virtue by heaven and the sun, or the Supreme Creator. It is equally manifest that this agent, existing in every egg and seed, is so imbued with the qualities of the parents, that it builds up the offspring in their likeness, not in its own; and this mingled also as proceeding from both united in copulation. Now, as all this proceeds with the most consummate foresight and intelligence, the presence of the Deity therein is clearly proclaimed.

But we shall have to speak at greater length upon this subject when we strive to show what it is that remains with the female immediately after intercourse, and where it is stored; at the same time that we explain—since there is nothing visible in the cavity of the uterus after intercourse—what that prolific contagion or prime conception is; whether it is corporeal and laid up within the female, or is incorporeal; whether the conception of the uterus be of the same nature or not with the conceptions of the brain, and fecundity be acquired in the same way as knowledge—a conclusion, in favour of which there is no lack of arguments; or, as motion and the animal operations, which we call appetites, derive their origin from the conceptions of the brain, may not the natural motions and the operations of the vegetative principle, and particularly generation, depend on the conception of the uterus? And then we have to inquire how this prolific contagion is of a mixed nature, and is imparted by the male to the female, and by her is transferred to the ovum? Finally, how the contagious principle of all diseases and preternatural affections spreads insensibly, and is propagated?

## EXERCISE 51. Of the order of generation; and, first, of the primary genital particle

It will be our business, by and by, when we come to treat of the matter in especial, to show what happens to the female from a fruitful embrace; what it is that remains with her after this, and which we have still spoken of under the name of contagion, by which, as by a kind of infection, she conceives, and an embryo subsequently begins to grow of its own accord. Meantime, we shall discourse of those things that manifestly appear in connexion with the organs of generation which seem most worthy of particular comment.

And first, since it appears certain that the chick is produced by epigenesis, or addition of the parts that successively arise, we shall inquire what part is formed first, before any of the rest appear, and what may be observed of this and its particular mode of generation.

What Aristotle (*On the Generation of Animals*, ii. 1.) says of the generation of the more perfect animals, is confirmed and made manifest by all that passes in the egg, viz.: that all the parts are not formed at once and together, but in succession, one after another; and that there first exists a particular genital particle, in virtue of which, as from a beginning, all the other parts proceed. As in the seeds of plants, in beans and acorns, to quote particular instances, we see the gemmula, or apex, protruding, the commencement of the entire prospective herb or tree.
> “And this particle is like a child emancipated, placed independently, a principle existing of itself, from whence the series of members is subsequently thrown out, and to which belongs all that is to conduce to the perfection of the future animal.”
Since, therefore,
> “No part engenders itself, but, after it is engendered, concurs in its own growth, it is indispensable that the part first arise which contains within itself the principle of increase; for whether it be a plant or an animal, still has it within itself the power of vegetation or nutrition”
(*Ibid.*, 4.); and at the same time distinguishes and fashions each particular part in its several order; and hence, in this same primogenate particle, there is a primary vital principle inherent, which is the author and original of sense and motion, and every manifestation of life.

That, therefore, is the principal particle whence vital spirit and native heat accrue to all other parts, in which the *calidum innatum sive implantatum* of physicians first shows itself, and the household deity or perennial fire is maintained; whence life proceeds to the body in general, and to each of its parts in particular; whence nourishment, growth, aid, and solace flow; lastly, where life first begins in the being that is born, and last fails in that which dies.

All this is certainly true as regards the first engendered part, and appears manifestly in the formation of the chick from the egg. I am, therefore, of opinion that we are to reject the views of certain physicians, indifferent philosophers, who will have it that three principal and primogenate parts arise together, viz.: the brain, the heart, and the liver; neither can I agree with Aristotle himself, who maintains that the heart is the first engendered and animated part; for I think that the privilege of priority belongs to the blood alone; the blood being that which is first seen of the newly engendered being, not only in the chick *in ovo* but in the embryo of every animal whatsoever, as shall plainly be made to appear at a later stage of our inquiry.

There appears at first, I say, a red-coloured pulsating point or vesicle, with lines or canals extending from it, containing blood in their interior, and, in so far as we are enabled to perceive from the most careful examination, the blood is produced before the *punctum saliens* is formed, and is, further, endowed with vital heat before it is put in motion by a pulse; so that as pulsation commences in it and from it, so, in the last struggle of mortal agony, does motion also end there. I have indeed ascertained by numerous experiments instituted upon the egg, as well as upon other subjects, that the blood is the element of the body in which, so long as the vital heat has not entirely departed, the power of returning to life is continued.

And since the pulsating vesicle and the sanguineous tubes extending thence are visible before anything else, I hold it as consonant with reason to believe that the blood is prior to its receptacles, the thing contained, to wit, to its container, inasmuch as this is made subservient to that. The vascular ramifications and the veins, therefore, after these the pulsating vesicle, and, finally, the heart, as being every one of them organs destined to receive and contain the blood, are, in all likelihood, constructed for the express purpose of impelling and distributing it, and the blood is, consequently, the principal portion of the body.

This conclusion is favoured by numerous observations; particularly by the fact that some animals, and these red-blooded, too, live for long periods without any pulse; some even lie concealed through the whole winter, and yet escape alive, though their heart had ceased from motion of every kind, and their lungs no longer played; they had lain in fact like those who lie half dead in a state of asphyxia from syncope, leipothymia, or the hysterical passion.

Emboldened by what I have observed both in studying the egg, and whilst engaged in the dissection of living animals, I maintain, against Aristotle, that the blood is the prime part that is engendered, and the heart the mere organ destined for its circulation. The function of the heart is the propulsion of the blood, as clearly appears in all animals furnished with red blood; and the office of the pulsating vesicle in the generation of the chick *ab ovo*, as well as in the embryos of mammiferous animals, is not different, a fact which I have repeatedly demonstrated to others, showing the *vesicula pulsans* as a feeble glancing spark, contracting in its action, now forcing out the blood which was contained in it, and again relaxing and receiving a fresh supply.

The supremacy of the blood further appears from this: that the pulse is derived from it; for, as there are two parts in a pulsation, viz.: distension or relaxation, and contraction, or *diastole* and *systole*, and, as distension is the prior of these two motions, it is manifest that this motion proceeds from the blood; the contraction, again, from the *vesicula pulsans* of the embryo *in ovo*, from the heart in the pullet, in virtue of its own fibres, as an instrument destined for this particular end. Certain it is, that the vesicle in question, as also the auricle of the heart at a later period, whence the pulsation begins, is excited to the motion of contraction by the distending blood. The *diastole*, I say, takes place from the blood swelling, as it were, in consequence of containing an inherent spirit, so that the opinion of Aristotle in regard to the pulsation of the heart—namely, that it takes place by a kind of ebullition—is not without some mixture of truth; for what we witness every day in milk heated over the fire, and in beer that is brisk with fermentation, comes into play in the pulse of the heart; in which the blood, swelling with a sort of fermentation, is alternately distended and repressed; the same thing that takes place in the liquids mentioned through an external agent, namely adventitious heat, is effected in the blood by an intimate heat, or an innate spirit; and this, too, is regulated in conformity with nature by the vital principle (*anima*), and is continued to the benefit of animated beings.

The pulse, then, is produced by a double agent: first, the blood undergoes distension or dilatation, and secondly, the vesicular membrane of the embryo in the egg, the auricles and ventricles in the extruded chick, effect the constriction. By these alternating motions associated, is the blood impelled through the whole body, and the life of animals is thereby continued.

Nor is the blood to be styled the primogenial and principal portion of the body, because the pulse has its commencement in and through it; but also because animal heat originates in it, and the vital spirit is associated with it, and it constitutes the vital principle itself (*ipsa anima*); for wheresoever the immediate and principal instrument of the vegetative faculty is first discovered, there also does it seem likely will the living principle be found to reside, and thence take its rise; seeing that the life is inseparable from spirit and innate heat. For
> “however distinct are the artist and the instrument in things made by art,” as Fabricius well reminds us, “in the works of nature they are still conjoined and one. Thus the stomach is the author and the organ of *chylopoesis*.”
In like manner are the vital principle and its instrument immediately conjoined; and so, in

whatever part of the body heat and motion have their origin, in this also must life take its rise, in this be last extinguished; and no one, I presume, will doubt that there are the lares and penates of life enshrined, that there the vital principle (*anima*) itself has its seat.[^1]

The life, therefore, resides in the blood (as we are also informed in our sacred writings, [^2]) because in it life and the soul first show themselves, and last become extinct. For I have frequently found, from the dissection of living animals, as I have said, that the heart of an animal that was dying, that was dead, and had ceased to breathe, still continued to pulsate for a time, and retained its vitality. The ventricles failing and coming to a stand, the motion still goes on in the auricles, and finally in the right auricle alone; and even when all motion has ceased, there the blood may still be seen affected with a kind of undulation and obscure palpitation or tremor, the last evidence of life. Everyone, indeed, may perceive that the blood—this author of pulsation and life—longest retains its heat; for when this is gone, and it is no longer blood, but gore, so is there, then, no hope of a return to life. But, truly, as has been stated, both in the chick *in ovo* and in the moribund animal, if you but apply some gentle stimulus either to the *punctum saliens* or to the right auricle of the heart after the failure of all pulsation, forthwith you will see motion, pulsation, and life restored to the blood—provided always, be it understood, that the innate heat and vital spirit have not been wholly lost.

From this it clearly appears that the blood is the generative part, the fountain of life, the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the soul; the element in which, as in a fountain head, the heat first and most abounds and flourishes; from whose influxive heat all the other parts of the body are cherished, and obtain their life; for the heat, the companion of the blood, flows through and cherishes and preserves the whole body, as I formerly demonstrated in my work *On the Motion of the Blood*.

And since blood is found in every particle of the body, so that you can nowhere prick with a needle, nor make the slightest scratch, but blood will instantly appear, it seems as if, without this fluid, the parts could neither have heat nor life. So that the blood, being in ever so trifling a degree concentrated and fixed—Hippocrates called the state *ἀπόληψις τῶν φλεβῶν*, *stasis of the veins*—as in *lipothymia*, alarm, exposure to severe cold, and on the accession of a febrile paroxysm, the whole body is observed to become cold and torpid, and, overspread with pallor and *livor*, to languish. But the blood, recalled by stimulants, by exercise, by certain emotions of the mind, such as joy or anger, suddenly all is hot, and flushed, and vigorous, and beautiful again.

Therefore it is that the red and sanguine parts, such as the flesh, are alone spoken of as hot, and the white and bloodless parts, on the contrary, such as the tendons and ligaments, are designated as cold. And as red-blooded animals excel exsanguine creatures, so also, in our estimate of the parts, are those which are more liberally furnished with native heat and blood, held more excellent than all the others. The liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and heart itself—parts which are especially entitled *viscera*—if you will but squeeze out all the blood they contain, become pale and fall within the category of cold parts. The heart itself, I say, receives influxive heat and life along with the blood that reaches it, through the coronary arteries; and only so long as the blood has access to it. Neither can the liver perform its office without the influence of the blood and heat it receives through the coeliac artery; for there is no influx of heat without an afflux of blood by the arteries, and this is the reason wherefore, when parts are first produced, and before they have taken upon them the performance of their respective duties, they all look bloodless and pale, in consequence of which they were formerly regarded as spermatic by physicians and anatomists, and in generation it was usual to say that several days were passed in the milk. The liver, lungs, and substance of the heart itself, when they first appear, are extremely white; and, indeed, the cone of the heart and the walls of the ventricles are still seen to be white, when the auricles, replete with crimson blood, are red, and the coronary vein is purple with its stream. In like manner, the parenchyma of the liver is white, when its veins and their branches are red with blood; nor does it perform any duty until it is penetrated with blood.

The blood, in a word, so flows around and penetrates the whole body, and imparts heat and life conjoined to all its parts, that the vital principle, having its first and chief seat there, may truly be held as resident in the blood; in this way, in common parlance, it comes to be all in all, and all in each particular part.

But so little is it true, as Aristotle and the medical writers assert, that the liver and the heart are the authors and compounders of the blood, that the contrary even appears most obviously from the formation of the chick *in ovo*, viz., that the blood is much rather the fashioner of the heart and liver; a fact which physicians themselves appear unintentionally to confirm, when they speak of the parenchyma of the liver as a kind of effusion of blood, as if it were nothing more than so much blood coagulated there. But the blood must exist before it can either be shed or coagulated; and experience palpably demonstrates that the thing is so, seeing that the blood is already present before there is a vestige either of the body or of any viscus; and that in circumstances where none of the mother’s blood can by possibility reach the embryo, an event which is vulgarly held to occur among viviparous animals.

The liver of fishes is always perceived of a white colour, though their veins are of a deep purple or black; and our fowls, the fatter they become, the smaller and paler grows the liver. Cachectic maidens, and those who labour under chlorosis, are not only pale and blanched in their bodies generally, but in their livers as well, a manifest indication of a want of blood in their system. The liver, therefore, receives both its heat and colour from the blood; the blood is in no wise derived from the liver.

From what has now been said, then, it appears that the blood is the first engendered part, whence the living principle in the first instance gleams forth, and from which the first animated particle of the embryo is formed; that it is the source and origin of all other parts, both similar and dissimilar, which thence obtain their vital heat and become subservient to it in its duties. But the heart is contrived for the sole purpose of ministering between the veins and the arteries—of receiving blood from the veins, and, by its ceaseless contractions, of propelling it to all parts of the body through the arteries.

This fact is made particularly striking, when we find that neither is there a heart found in every animal, neither does it necessarily and in every instance pulsate at all times where it is encountered; the blood, however, or a fluid which stands in lieu of it, is never wanting.

## EXERCISE 52. Of the blood as prime element in the body

It is unquestionable, then, and obvious to sense, that the blood is the first formed, and therefore the genital part of the embryo, and that it has all the attributes which have been ascribed to it in the preceding exercise. It is both the author and preserver of the body; it is the principal element moreover, and that in which the vital principle (*anima*) has its dwelling-place. Because, as already said, before there is any particle of the body obvious to sight, the blood is already extant, has already increased in quantity, as Aristotle expresses it:
> “and palpitates within the veins,” “being moved hither and thither, and being the only humour that is distributed to every part of the animal body. The blood, moreover, is that alone which lives and is possessed of heat whilst life continues.”[^3]

And further, from its various motions in acceleration or retardation, in turbulence and strength, or debility, it is manifest that the blood perceives things that tend to injure by irritating, or to benefit by cherishing it. We therefore conclude that the blood lives of itself, and supplies its own nourishment; and that it depends in nowise upon any other part of the body, which is either prior to itself or of greater excellence and worth. On the contrary, the whole body, as posthumous to it, as added and appended, as it were, to it, depends on the blood, though this is not the place to prove the fact; I shall only say, with Aristotle, that:
> “The nature of the blood is the undoubted cause wherefore many things happen among animals, both as regards their tempers and their capacities.”[^4]
To the blood, therefore, we may refer as the cause not only of life in general—inasmuch as there is no other inherent or influxive heat that may be the immediate instrument of the living principle except the blood—but also of longer or shorter life, of sleep and watching, of genius or aptitude, strength, &c.
> “For through its tenuity and purity,” says Aristotle in the same place, “animals are made wiser and have more noble senses; and in like manner they are more timid and courageous, or passionate and furious, as their blood is more dilute, or replete with dense fibres.”

Nor is the blood the author of life only, but, according to its diversities, the cause of health and disease likewise: so that poisons, which come from without, such as poisoned wounds, unless they infect the blood, occasion no mischief. Life and death, therefore, flow for us from the same spring.
> “If the blood becomes too diffluent,” says Aristotle, “we fall sick; for it sometimes resolves itself into such a sanguinolent serum, that the body is covered with a bloody sweat; and if there be too great a loss of blood, life is gone.”[^5]
And, indeed, not only do the parts of the body at all times become torpid when blood is lost, but if the loss be excessive, the animal necessarily dies. I do not think it requisite to quote any particular experiment in confirmation of these views: the whole subject would require to be treated specially.

The admirable circulation of the blood originally discovered by me, I have lived to see admitted by almost all; nor has aught as yet been urged against it by anyone which has seemed greatly to require an answer. Wherefore, I imagine that I shall perform a task not less new and useful than agreeable to philosophers and medical men, if I here briefly discourse of the causes and uses of the circulation, and expose other obscure matters respecting the blood; if I show, for instance, how much it concerns our welfare that by a wholesome and regulated diet we keep our blood pure and sweet. When I have accomplished this it will no longer, I trust, seem so improbable and absurd to anyone as it did to Aristotle[^6] in former times, that the blood should be viewed as the familiar divinity, as the soul itself of the body, which was the opinion of Critias and others, who maintained that the prime faculty of the living principle (*anima*) was to feel, and that this faculty inhered in the body in virtue of the nature of the blood. Thales, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Alcmaeon, and others, held the blood to be the soul, because, by its nature, it had a faculty of motion.

Now that both sense and motion are in the blood is obvious from many indications, although Aristotle[^7] denies the fact. And, indeed, when we see him, yielding to the force of truth, brought to admit that there is a vital principle even in the hypenemic egg; and in the spermatic fluid and blood a “certain divine something corresponding with the element of the stars,” and that it is vicarious of the Almighty Creator; and if the moderns be correct in their views when they say that the seminal fluid of animals emitted *in coitu* is alive, wherefore should we not, with like reason, affirm that there is a vital principle in the blood, and that when this is first ingested and nourished and moved, the vital spark is first struck and enkindled? Unquestionably the blood is that in which the vegetative and sensitive operations first proclaim themselves; that in which heat, the primary and immediate instrument of life, is innate; that which is the common bond between soul and body, and the vehicle by which life is conveyed into every particle of the organized being.

Besides, if it be a matter of such difficulty to understand the spermatic fluid as we have found it, to fathom how through it the formation of the body is made to begin and proceed with such foresight, art, and divine intelligence, wherefore should we not, with equal propriety, admit an exalted nature in the blood, and think at least as highly of it as we have been led to do of the semen?—the rather, as this fluid is itself produced from the blood, as appears from the history of the egg; and the whole organized body not only derives its origin, as from a genital part, but even appears to owe its preservation to the blood.

We have, indeed, already said so much incidentally above, intending to speak on the subject more particularly at another time. Nor do I think that we are here to dispute whether it is strictly correct to speak of the blood as a part; some deny the propriety of such language, moved especially by the consideration that it is not sensible, and that it flows into all parts of the body to supply them with nourishment. For myself, however, I have discovered not a few things connected with the manner of generation which differ essentially from those motions which philosophers and medical writers generally either admit or reject. At this time I say no more on this point; but though I admit the blood to be without sensation, it does not follow that it should not form a portion, and even a very principal portion, of a body which is endowed with sensibility. For neither does the brain nor the spinal marrow, nor the crystalline or the vitreous humour of the eye, feel anything, though, by the common consent of all, philosophers and physicians alike, these are parts of the body. Aristotle placed the blood among the *partes similares*; Hippocrates, as the animal body according to him is made up of containing, contained, and impelling parts, of course, reckoned the blood among the number of parts contained.

But we shall have more to say on this topic when we treat of that wherein a part consists, and how many kinds of parts there are. Meantime, I cannot be silent on the remarkable fact that the heart itself, this most distinguished member in the body, appears to be insensible.

A young nobleman, eldest son of the Viscount Montgomery, when a child, had a severe fall, attended with fracture of the ribs of the left side. The consequence of this was a suppurating abscess, which went on discharging abundantly for a long time, from an immense gap in his side; this I had from himself and other credible persons who were witnesses. Between the eighteenth and nineteenth years of his age, this young nobleman, having travelled through France and Italy, came to London, having at this time a very large open cavity in his side, through which the lungs, as it was believed, could both be seen and touched. When this circumstance was told as something miraculous to his Serene Majesty King Charles, he straightway sent me to wait on the young man, that I might ascertain the true state of the case. And what did I find? A young man, well grown, of good complexion, and apparently possessed of an excellent constitution, so that I thought the whole story must be a fable. Having saluted him according to custom, however, and informed him of the king’s expressed desire that I should wait upon him, he immediately showed me everything, and laid open his left side for my inspection, by removing a plate which he wore there by way of defence against accidental blows and other external injuries. I found a large open space in the chest, into which I could readily introduce three of my fingers and my thumb; which done, I straightway perceived a certain protuberant fleshy part, affected with an alternating extrusive and intrusive movement; this part I touched gently. Amazed with the novelty of such a state, I examined everything again and again, and when I had satisfied myself, I saw that it was a case of old and extensive ulcer, beyond the reach of art, but brought by a miracle to a kind of cure, the interior being invested with a membrane, and the edges protected with a tough skin. But the fleshy part (which I at first sight took for a mass of granulations, and others had always regarded as a portion of the lung, from its pulsating motions and the rhythm they observed with the pulse)—when the fingers of one of my hands were applied to it, those of the other to the artery at the wrist—as well as from their discordance with the respiratory movements, I saw was no portion of the lung that I was handling, but the apex of the heart! covered over with a layer of fungous flesh by way of external defence, as commonly happens in old foul ulcers. The servant of this young man was in the habit daily of cleansing the cavity from its accumulated *sordes* by means of injections of tepid water; after which the plate was applied, and, with this in its place, the young man felt adequate to any exercise or expedition, and, in short, he led a pleasant life in perfect safety.

Instead of a verbal answer, therefore, I carried the young man himself to the king, that his majesty might with his own eyes behold this wonderful case: that, in a man alive and well, he might, without detriment to the individual, observe the movement of the heart, and, with his proper hand even touch the ventricles as they contracted. And his most excellent majesty, as well as myself, acknowledged that the heart was without the sense of touch; for the youth never knew when we touched his heart, except by the sight or the sensation he had through the external integument.

We also particularly observed the movements of the heart, viz.: that in the *diastole* it was retracted and withdrawn; whilst in the *systole* it emerged and protruded; and the *systole* of the heart took place at the moment the *diastole* or pulse in the wrist was perceived; to conclude, the heart struck the walls of the chest, and became prominent at the time it bounded upwards and underwent contraction on itself.

Neither is this the place for taking up that other controversy; to wit, whether the blood alone serves for the nutrition of the body? Aristotle in several places contends that the blood is the ultimate aliment of the body, and in this view he is supported by the whole body of physicians. But many things of difficult interpretation, and that hang but indifferently together, follow from this opinion of theirs. For when the medical writers speak of the blood in their physiological disquisitions, and teach that the above is its sole use and end, viz.: to supply nourishment to the body, they proceed to compose it of four humours, or juices, adducing arguments for such a view from the combinations of the four primary qualities; and then they assert that the mass of the blood is made up of the two kinds of bile, the yellow and the black, of *pituita*, and the blood properly so called. And thus they arrive at their four humours, of which the *pituita* is held to be cold and moist; the black bile cold and dry; the yellow bile hot and dry; and the blood hot and moist. Further, of each of these several kinds, they maintain that some are nutritious, and compose the whole of the body; others, again, they say are excrementitious. Still further, they suppose that the blood proper is composed of the nutritious or heterogeneous portions; but the constitution of the mass is such that the *pituita* is a cruder matter, which the more powerful native heat can convert into perfect blood. They deny, however, that the bile can by any means be thus transformed into blood; although the blood, they say, is readily changed into bile, an event which they conceive takes place in melancholic diseases, through an excess of the concocting heat.

Now, if all this were true, and there be no retrogressive movement, viz., from black bile to bile, from bile to blood, they would be brought to the dilemma of having to admit that all the juices were present for the production of black bile, and that this was a principal and most highly concocted nutriment. It would further be imperative on them to recognize a kind of twofold blood, viz., one consisting of the entire mass of fluid contained in the veins, and composed of the four humours aforesaid; and another consisting of the purer, more fluid and spirituous portion, the fluid, which in the stricter sense they call blood, which some of them contend is contained in the arteries apart from the rest, and which they then depute upon sundry special offices. On their own showing, therefore, the pure blood is no aliment for the body, but a certain mixed fluid, or rather black bile, to which the rest of the humours tend.

Aristotle,[^8] too, although he thought that the blood existed as a means of nourishing the body, still believed that it was composed, as it were, of several portions, viz., of a thicker and black portion which subsides to the bottom of the basin when the blood coagulates, and this portion he held to be of an inferior nature;
> “for the blood,” he says, “if it be entire, is of a red colour and sweet taste; but if vitiated either by nature or disease, it is blacker.”[^9]
He also will have it fibrous in part or partly composed of fibres, which being removed, he continues,[^10] the blood neither sets nor becomes any thicker. He further admitted a *sanies* in the blood:
> “*Sanies* is unconcocted blood, or blood not yet completely concocted, or which is as yet dilute like serum.”
And this part, he says, is of a colder nature. The fibrous he believed to be the earthy portion of the blood.

According to the view of the *Stagirite*, therefore, the blood of different animals differs in several ways; in one it is more serous and thinner, a kind of *ichor* or *sanies*, as in insects, and the colder and less perfect animals; in another it is thicker, more fibrous, and earthy, as in the wild boar, bull, ass, &c. In some where the constitution is distempered, the blood is of a blacker hue; in others it is bright, pure, and florid, as in birds, and the human subject especially.

Whence, it appears, that in the opinion of the physicians, as well as of Aristotle, the blood consists of several parts, in some sort of the same description, according to the views of each. Medical men, indeed, only pay attention to human blood, taken in phlebotomy and contained in cups and coagulated. But Aristotle took a view of the blood of animals generally, or of the fluid which is analogous to it. And I, omitting all points of controversy, and passing by any discussion of the inconveniences that wait upon the opinions of writers in general, shall here touch lightly upon the points that all are agreed in, that can be apprehended by the senses, and that pertain more especially to our subject; intending, however, to treat of everything at length elsewhere.

Although the blood be, as I have said, a portion of the body—the primogenial and principal part, indeed—still, if it be considered in its mass, and as it presents itself in the veins, there is nothing to hinder us from believing that it contains and concocts nourishment within itself, which it applies to all the other parts of the body. With the matter so considered, we can understand how it should both nourish and be nourished, and how it should be both the matter and the efficient cause of the body, and have the natural constitution which Aristotle held necessary in a primogenial part, viz., that it should be partly of similar, partly of dissimilar constitution; for he says:
> “As it was requisite for the sake of sensation that there should be similar members in animal bodies, and as the faculty of perceiving, the faculty of moving, and the faculty of nourishing, are all contained in the same member (viz., the primogenate particle), it follows necessarily that this member, which originally contains inherent principles of the above kind, be extant both simply, that it may be capable of sensation of every description, and dissimilarly, that it may move and act. Wherefore, in the tribes that have blood, the heart is held to be such a member; in the bloodless tribes, however, it is proportional to their state.”

Now, if Aristotle understands by the heart that which first appears in the embryo of the chick *in ovo*, the blood, to wit, with its containing parts—the pulsating vesicles and veins, as one and the same organ, I conceive that he has expressed himself most accurately; for the blood, as it is seen in the egg and the vesicles, is partly similar and partly dissimilar. But if he understands the matter otherwise, what is seen in the egg sufficiently refutes him, inasmuch as the substance of the heart, considered independently of the blood—the ventricular cone—is engendered long afterwards, and continues white without any infusion of blood, until the heart has been fashioned into that form of organ by which the blood is distributed through the whole body. Nor indeed does the heart

even then present itself with the structure of a
similar and simple part, such as might become a
primogenial part, but is seen to be fibrous,
fleshy, or muscular, and indeed is obviously
what Hippocrates styled it, a muscle or instru¬
ment of motion. But the blood, as it is first per¬
ceived, and as it pulsates, included within its
vesicle, has as manifestly the constitution which
Aristotle held necessary in a principal part. For
the blood, whilst it is naturally in the body, has
everywhere apparently the same constitution;
when extravasated, however, and deprived of
its native heat, immediately, like any dissimi¬
lar compound it separates into several parts.

Were the blood destined by nature, how¬
ever, for the nourishment of the body only, it
would have a more similar constitution, like the
chyle or the *albumen* of the egg; or at all events
it would be truly one and a single body com¬
posed of the parts or juices indicated, like the
other humours, such as bile of either kind, and
*pituita* or phlegm, which retain the same form
and character without the body, which they
showed within their appropriate receptacles;
they undergo no such sudden change as the
blood.

Wherefore, the qualities which Aristotle
ascribed to a principal part are found associated
in the blood; which as a natural body, existing
heterogeneously or dissimilarly, is composed of
these juices or parts; but as it lives and is a very
principal animal part, consisting of these juices
mingled together, it is an animated similar part,
composed of a body and a vital principle. When
this living principle of the blood escapes, how¬
ever, in consequence of the extinction of the
native heat, the primary substance is forthwith
corrupted and resolved into the parts of which
it was formerly composed; first into *cruor*,
afterwards with red and white parts, those of
the red parts that are uppermost being more
florid, those that are lowest being black. Of
these parts, moreover, some are fibrous and
tough (and these are the uniting medium of the
rest), others *ichorous* and *serous*, in which the
mass of *coagulum* is wont to swim. Into such a
serum does the blood almost wholly resolve it¬
self at last. But these parts have no existence
severally in living blood; it is in that only which
has become corrupted and is resolved by death
that they are encountered.

Besides the constituents of the blood now
indicated, there is yet another which is seen in
the blood of the hotter and stronger animals,
such as horses, oxen, and men also of ardent
constitution. This is seen in blood drawn from
the body as it coagulates, in the upper part of
the red mass, and bears a perfect resemblance
to hartshorn jelly, or mucilage, or thick white
of egg. The vulgar believe this matter to be the
*pituita*; Aristotle designated it the crude and
unconcocted portion of the blood.

I have observed that this part of the blood
differs both from the others and from the more
serous portion in which the coagulated clot is
wont to swim in the basin, and also from the
urine which percolates through the kidneys
from the blood. Neither is it to be regarded as
any more crude or colder portion of the blood,
but rather, as I conceive, as a more spiritual
part; a conclusion to which I am moved by two
motives: first, because it swims above the
bright and florid portion — commonly thought
to be the arterial blood — as if it were hotter
and more highly charged with spirits, and takes
possession of the highest place in the disinte¬
gration of the blood.

Secondly, in venesection, blood of this kind,
which is mostly met with among men of warm
temperament, strong and muscular, escapes in
a longer stream and with greater force, as if
pushed from a syringe, in the same way as we
say that the spermatic fluid which is ejected
vigorously and to a distance is both more fruit¬
ful and full of spirits.

That this mucilaginous matter differs greatly
from the *ichorous* or watery part of the blood,
which, as if colder than the rest, subsides to the
bottom of the basin, appears on two distinct
grounds: for the watery and *sanious* portion is
too crude and unconcocted ever to pass into
purer and more perfect blood; and the thicker
and more fibrous mucus swimming above the
clot of the blood itself appears more concoct
and better elaborated than this; and so in the
resolution or separation of the blood it comes
that the mucus occupies the upper place, the
*sanies* the lower; the clot and red parts, how¬
ever — both those of a brighter and those of a
darker colour — occupy the middle space.

For it is certain that not only this part, but
the whole blood, and indeed the flesh itself— as
may be seen in criminals hung in chains — may
be reduced to an *ichorous sanies*; that is to say,
become resolved into the matters of which they
were composed, like salt into the *lixivium* from
which it had been obtained. In like manner,
the blood taken away in any *cachexy* abounds
in serum, and this to such an extent that oc¬
casionally scarce any clot is seen — the whole
mass of blood forms one *sanies*. This is observed
in *leucophlegmatia*, and is natural in bloodless
animals.

Further, if you take away some blood short¬
ly after a meal, before the second digestion has
been completed and the serum has had time to
descend by the kidneys, or at the commence¬
ment of an attack of intermittent fever, you
will find it *sanious*, inconcoct, and abounding
in serum. On the contrary, if you open a vein
after fasting, or a copious discharge of urine or
sweat, you will find the blood thick, as if with¬
out serum, and almost wholly condensed into
clot.

And in the same way as in coagulating blood
you find a little of the afore-mentioned super¬
natant mucus, so if you expose the *sanies* in
question, separated from the clot, to a gentle
heat over the fire, you will find it to be speedily
changed into the mucus; an obvious indication
that the water or *sanies* which separates from
the blood in the basin, is perchance a certain
element in the urine, but not the urine itself,
although in colour and consistence it seems so
in fact. The urine is not coagulated or con¬
densed into a fibrous mucus, but rather into a
*lixivium*; the watery or *sanious* portion of the
urine, however, when lightly boiled, does oc¬
casionally run into a mucus that swims through
the fluid; in the same way, as the mucus in
question rendered recrudescent by corruption,
liquefies and returns to the state of *sanies*.

So far at this time have I thought fit to pro¬
duce these my own observations on this constit¬
uent of the blood, intending to speak more
fully of it as well as of the other constituents
cognizable by the senses, and admitted by Aris¬
totle and the medical writers.

That I may not seem to wander too widely
from my purpose, I would here have it under¬
stood that with Aristotle I receive the blood as
a part of the living animal body, and not as it is
commonly regarded in the light of mere gore.
The Stagirite says:
> “The blood is warm, in the
> sense in which we should understand warm
> water, did we designate that fluid by a simple
> name, not viewing it as heated. For heat be¬
> longs to its nature; just as whiteness is in the
> nature of a white man. But when the blood be¬
> comes hot through any affection or passion, it
> is not then hot of itself. The same thing must
> be said in regard to the qualities of dryness and
> moistness. Wherefore, in the nature of such
> things they are partly hot and partly moist;
> but separated, they congeal and become cold;
> and such is the blood.” ^

The blood, consequently, as it is a living ele¬
ment of the body, is of a doubtful nature, and
falls to be considered under two points of view.
Materially and *per se* it is called nourishment;
but formally and in so far as it is endowed with
heat and spirits, the immediate instruments of
the vital principle, and even with vitality (*anima*),
it is to be regarded as the familiar divinity
and preserver of the body, as the generative
first engendered and very principal part. And
as the prolific egg contains within it the matter,
instrument, and framer of the future pullet,
and all physicians admit a mixture of the semi¬
nal fluids of the two sexes in the uterus during
or immediately after intercourse as constituting
the mixed cause, both material and efficient, of
the foetus; so might one with more propriety
maintain that the blood was both the matter
and preserver of the body, though not the sole
aliment; because it is observed that in animals
which die of hunger, and in men who perish of
marasmus, a considerable quantity of blood is
still found after death in the veins. And fur¬
ther, in youthful subjects still growing, and in
aged individuals declining and falling away, the
relative quantity of blood continues the same,
and is in the ratio of the flesh that is present, as
if the blood were a part of the body, but not
destined solely for its nourishment; for if it
were so, no one would die of hunger so long as
he had any blood left in his veins, just as the
lamp is not extinguished whilst there is a drop
of inflammable oil left in the cruse.

Now when I maintain that the living princi¬
ple resides primarily and principally in the
blood, I would not have it inferred from thence
that I hold all bloodletting in discredit, as dan¬
gerous and injurious; or that I believe with the
vulgar that in the same measure as blood is lost,
is life abridged, because the sacred writings tell
us that the life is in the blood; for daily expe¬
rience satisfies us that bloodletting has a most
salutary effect in many diseases, and is indeed
the foremost among all the general remedial
means: vitiated states and plethora of the
blood, are causes of a whole host of diseases; and
the timely evacuation of a certain quantity of
the fluid frequently delivers patients from
very dangerous diseases, and even from immi¬
nent death. In the same measure as blood is de¬
tracted, therefore, under certain circumstances,
it may be said that life and health are added.

This indeed nature teaches, and physicians
at all events propose to themselves to imitate
nature; for copious critical discharges of blood
from the nostrils, from hemorrhoids, and in the
shape of the menstrual flux, often deliver us
from very serious diseases. Young persons,
therefore, who live fully and lead indolent lives,
unless between their eighteenth and twentieth
years they have a spontaneous hemorrhage
from the nose or lower parts of the body, or
have a vein opened, by which they are relieved
of the load of blood that oppresses them, are
apt to be seized with fever or smallpox, or they
suffer from headache and other morbid symp¬
toms of various degrees of severity and danger.
Veterinary surgeons are in the habit of begin¬
ning the treatment of almost all the diseases of
cattle with bloodletting.

## EXERCISE 53. Of the inferences deducible from the course of the umbilical vessels in the egg

We find the blood formed in the egg and em¬
bryo before any other part; and almost at the
same moment appear its receptacles, the veins
and the *vesicula pulsans*. Wherefore, if we re¬
gard the *punctum saliens* as the heart, and this
along with the blood and the veins as constitut¬
ing one and the same organ, conspicuous in the
very commencement of the embryo, although
we should admit that the proper substance of
the heart was deposited subsequently, still we
should be ready to admit with Aristotle that
the heart (an organ made up of ventricles, auri¬
cles, vessels, and blood) was in truth the princi¬
pal and primogenate part of the body, its own
prime and essential element having been the
blood, both in the order of nature and of genet¬
ic production.

The parts that in generation succeed the
blood are the veins, for the blood is necessarily
inclosed and contained in vessels; so that, as
Aristotle observes, we find two *meatus venales*
even from the very first, which canals, as we
have shown in our history, afterwards consti¬
tute the umbilical vessels. It seems necessary,
therefore, to say something here of the situa¬
tion and course of these vessels.

In the first place, then, it is to be observed
that all the arteries and veins have their origin
from the heart and are, as it were, appendices
or parts added to the central organ. If, there¬
fore, you carefully examine the embryo of the
human subject, or one of the lower animals, and
having divided the *vena cava* between the right
auricle and the diaphragm, look into it upwards
or towards the heart, you will perceive three
*foramina*, the largest and most posterior of
which tending to the spine is the *vena cava*; the
anterior and lesser proceeds to the root and
trunk of the umbilical vessels; the third and
least of all enters the liver and is the origin and
trunk of all the ramifications distributed to the
convexity of that organ. Whence it clearly ap¬
pears that the veins do by no means all proceed
from the liver as their origin and commence¬
ment, but from the heart — unless indeed any
one would be hardy enough to contend that a
vessel proceeded from its branches, not the
branches from the trunk of the vessel.

Moreover, as the vessels in question are dis¬
tributed equally to the *albumen* and *vitellus* of
the egg, not otherwise than as the roots of trees
are connected with the ground, it is obvious
that both of these substances must serve for the
nutriment of the embryo, and that they are
taken up and carried to it by these vessels.
But this view is opposed to that of Aristotle,
who everywhere maintains that the chick is
formed from the *albumen*, and receives nourish¬
ment through the umbilicus alone. The *al¬
bumen* indeed is first consumed, and the yelk
serves subsequently for food, supplying the
place of the milk, which viviparous animals re¬
ceive after their birth from their mothers. The
food which Nature provides for the young of
viviparous tribes in the dug of the mother, she
supplies in the yelk of the egg to the young of
oviparous animals. Whence it happens, that
when the *albumen* is almost wholly consumed,
the *vitellus* still remains nearly entire in the
egg, the chick being already perfect and com¬
plete; more than this, the yelk is still found in
the abdomen of the chick long after its exclu¬
sion. Aristotle discovered some on the eight¬
eenth day after the hatching; and I have my¬
self seen a small quantity connected with the
intestine at the end of six weeks from that
epoch.

Nevertheless, from the yelk (which certainly
does not decrease in the same ratio as the *albu¬
men* whilst the chick is forming) that is taken
into the abdomen of the chick, and from the
distribution of vessels through its substance,
the whole of these collecting into a single
trunk which enters the *porta* of the liver, and
doubtless carrying that portion of yelk they
have absorbed for more perfect elaboration in
that viscus — these and other arguments of the
like kind force me to say that I cannot do other¬
wise than admit with Aristotle that the yelk
supplies food to the chick, and is analogous to
milk.

The whole of the yelk, indeed, does not re¬
main after the foetus of the fowl is fully formed;
for a certain portion of it has been liquefied on
the very first appearance of the embryo, and re¬
ceives branches of vessels no less than the *albu¬
men*, by which, already prepared, it is carried
as nourishment for the chick; still it is certain
that the greater portion of the yelk remains
after the disappearance of the *albumen*; that it
is laid up in the abdomen of the chick when
excluded, and, attracted or absorbed by the
branches of the *vena portae*, that it is finally
carried to the liver.

It is manifest, therefore, that the chick when
hatched, is nourished by the yelk in the first
period of its independent existence. And as
within the egg the embryo was nourished part¬
ly by the *albumen*, partly by the *vitellus*, but
principally by the *albumen*, which is both
present in larger quantity, and is more speedily
consumed, so when the chick is hatched, and
when all the nourishment that is taken must
pass through the liver to undergo ulterior prep¬
aration, is it nourished partly by the *vitellus*
and partly by chyle absorbed from the intes¬
tines, but principally by chyle, which the host
of subdivisions of the mesenteric vessels seize
upon, whilst there is but a single vessel from the
*porta* distributed to the *vitellus*, and by and by
but little of it remains. Nature, therefore, acts
as does the nurse, who gradually habituates her
infant to the food which is to take the place of
her failing supply of milk. The pullet is thus
gradually brought from food of more easy to
food of more difficult digestion, from yelk to
chyle.

Wherefore, there is every reason for what we
perceive in connexion with the course of the
veins in the egg. When the embryo first begins
to be formed, they are distributed to the *colli¬
quament* only, where the blood finds suitable
nutriment and matter for the formation of the
body; but by and by they extend into the thin¬
ner *albumen*, whence the chick, whilst it is yet
in the state of gelatine or *mucor*, and resembles
a maggot in form, derives its increase; the
branches next extend into the thicker *albumen*,
and then into the *vitellus*, that they may also
contribute to the support of the foetus, which,
having at length arrived at maturity and been
extruded, still preserves a portion of the yelk
(or milk) within its abdomen, whereby it is
maintained in part, in part by food selected
and prepared for it by the mother, until it is
able to look out for and to digest its own ali¬
ment. Thus does nature most wisely provide
food through the whole round of generation,
suited to the various strength of the digestive
faculty in the future being. In the first period
of the foetal chick’s existence a more delicate
food is prepared for it; more advanced, firmer
and firmer food is supplied; and this is the rea¬
son, I apprehend, wherefore, the perfect egg
consists not only of two portions of different
colours, but is even provided with two kinds of
*albumen*.

Now all this that we discover from actual ex¬
perience of the matter accords with the opin¬
ion of Aristotle, where he says:
> “The part
> which is hot is best adapted to give form to the
> limbs; that which is more earthy rather con¬
> duces to the constitution of the body and is
> more remote. Wherefore in eggs of two colours,
> the animal begins to be engendered from the
> white (for the beginning of animal life is in the
> hot), and derives its nourishment from the yel¬
> low. In the warmer animals, consequently,
> these parts are kept distinct from one another,
> viz., that from which the beginning is derived,
> and that whence the nourishment is obtained,
> and the one is white, the other yellow.”^

From what has now been said it appears that
the chick — and we shall show that it is not
otherwise in all other animals — arises and is
constituted, as it were, by a principle or soul
inherent in the egg, and that in the same way
the proper aliment is sought for and is supplied
within the egg; whereby it comes that the chick
is not dependent on its mother in the same way
as plants are dependent on the ground; and it is
not more correct to say that the chick is nour¬
ished by the blood of its mother, or that its
heart beats, and that it lives through the
spirits of its parent, than it would be to assert
that it moved and felt through the organs, or
grew and attained to adult age through the
vital principle of its parent. It is manifest, on
the contrary, and is allowed by all that the
foetal chick is nourished through its umbilical
vessels; and that the vascular ramifications dis¬
persed over the *albumen* and yelk imbibe nour¬
ishment from them and convey it to the foetus.
It is also admitted that the chick, when ex¬
cluded from the shell, is supplied with nourish¬
ment, partly from yelk, partly from chyle, and
that in either case the aliment passes by the
same route, viz., by the *vena portae* into the
liver, the branches of this vessel effecting the
transit.

It is therefore obvious, as I now say by the
way, that the chyle by which all animals are
nourished is brought by the mesenteric veins
from the intestines; nor is there occasion to
look for any new passage — by the *lacteal ves¬
sels*, to wit — or any route in adult animals other
than that which we discover in the egg and
chick. But we shall recur more fully in another
place to the inconveniences of such an opinion
as that referred to.

Lastly, from the structure of the umbilical
vessels of the chick *in ovo*, some of which as
stated in the history are veins, others arteries,
it is legitimate to conclude that there is here a
circular motion of the blood, such as we have
already demonstrated in the animal body, in
our book *On the Motion of the Blood*, and this
for the sake of the nutrition and growth of the
embryo, and because the umbilical veins are
distributed to either fluid of the egg, that they
may thence bring nutriment to the chick, and
the arteries accompany the veins, that by their
affluxive heat the alimentary matter may be
duly concocted, liquefied, and made fit to an¬
swer the ends of nutrition.

And hence it happens that wherever veins —
and here I would have it understood that both
arteries and veins are intended — make their
way into the *albumen* or *vitellus*, there these
fluids look liquefied and different from the rest.
For as soon as the branches of the veins shoot
forth, the upper portion of the *albumen* in
which they are implanted, passing into *colli¬
quament*, becomes transparent, whilst the lower
portion, continuing thick and compact, is
pushed into the inferior angle of the egg. In like
manner a separation of the *vitellus*, as it seems
into two portions, makes its appearance, the
one being superior, and the other inferior, and
these do not differ less from one another in
character than melted differs from solid wax;
now this division corresponds to the two parts
which severally receive or do not receive blood¬
vessels.

Hence are we further made more certain as
to the commencement of animal generation
and the prime inherent principle of the egg.
For it is assuredly known that the *cicatricula* or
spot on the yelk is the chief point in the egg,
that to which all the rest are subordinate, and
to which, if to any one thing more than an¬
other, is to be referred the cause, whatever it
be, of fecundity in the egg: — certain it is that
the generation of the embryo is begun within
its precincts. Wherefore, as we have said, the
first effect of incubation is to cause dilatation of
the *cicatricula*, and the formation of the *colli¬
quament*, in which the blood first flushes and
veins are distributed, and where the effects of
the native heat and the influence of the plastic
power first show themselves. And then, the
more widely the ramifications of these veins
extend, in the same proportion do indications
of the presence of the vital power and vegeta¬
tive force appear. For every effect is a clear evi¬
dence of its efficient cause.

In a word I say — from the *cicatricula* (in
which the first trace of the native heat ap¬
pears) proceeds the entire process of genera¬
tion; from the heart the whole chick, and from
the umbilical vessels the whole of the mem¬
branes called *secundines* that surround it. We
therefore conclude that the parts of the embryo
are severally subordinate, and that life is first
derived from the heart.

## EXERCISE 54. Of the order of the parts in generation from an egg, according to Fabricius

Having already determined what part is to
be esteemed the first, the blood, to wit, with
its receptacles, the heart, veins, and arteries,
the next thing we have to do is to speak of the
rest of the parts of the body and of the order
and manner of their generation.

Fabricius, in whose footsteps we have re¬
solved to tread, in speaking of the generation
of the chick *in ovo*, passes in review the actions
which take place in the egg, and by the effect
of which the parts are produced, discussing
them *seriatim*, as if a clearer view were thence
to be obtained of the order or sequence of gen¬
eration.
> “There are three primary actions,” he says,^
> “which present themselves in the egg of the
> bird: 1st, the generation of the embryo;
> 2nd, its growth; 3rd, its nourishment. The
> first, or generation, is the proper action of the
> egg; the second and third, viz., growth and
> nutrition, go on for the major part without the
> egg, though they are begun and also perfectly

> part of the chick, such as we see it, from the
> *chalaza* of the egg, the other has given it figure,
> articulations, and position, fitting it for its des¬

> terative faculty, is entirely natural, and acts
> without all consciousness; and taking the hot,
> the cold, the moist, and the dry, it alters all
> through the substance of the *chalaza*, and in

> that is to say, its *chalaza*; by altering and com¬

accomplish which both the semen of the cock as agent and fecundator, and the chalaza as matter are required. In the second place comes accretion or growth, which is accomplished by nutrition, whose faculties consist in attraction, retention, concoction, expulsion, and, finally, apposition, agglutination, and assimilation of food.”

But for my part I neither regard such a distribution of actions as correct, or useful, or convenient in this place. It is incorrect, because those actions which he would make distinct in

## WILLIAM HARVEY

442
kind and in time — for instance, that parts are first produced similar by the alterative or transformative faculty, to be afterwards fashioned and organized by the formative faculty, and finally made to grow by the auctive faculty — are never apparent in the generation of the chick; for the several parts are produced and distinguished and increased simultaneously. For although in the generation of those animals which are formed by metamorphosis, where from matter previously existing, and already adequate in quantity and duly prepared, all the parts are made distinct and conformed by transformation, as when a butterfly is formed from a caterpillar, a silkworm from a grub, still in generation by epigenesis the thing is very different, nor do the same processes go on as in ordinary nutrition, which is effected by the various actions of different parts working together to a common end, the food being here first assumed and retained, then digested, next distributed, and finally agglutinated. Nor is the similar constitution the result of the transformative faculty, void of all foresight, as Fabricius imagined; but the organic comes from the formative faculty which proceeds with both consciousness and foresight. For generation and growth do not proceed without nutrition, nor nutrition or increase without generation;

> “to nourish” being, in other terms, to substitute for a certain quantity of matter lost as much matter of the same quality, flesh or nerve, in lieu of the matter, flesh or nerve, that has become effete. But what is this but to make or engender flesh or nerve?

In like manner, growth cannot go on without generation, for all natural bodies are increased by the accession of new particles similar to those of which they formerly consisted, and this, taking place according to all their dimensions, they are distinguished as regards their parts, and are organized at the same time that they grow.

But to engender the chick is in truth nothing else than to fashion or make its several members and organs, which, although they are produced in a certain order, and some are postgenate to others — the less important to the more principal organs — still, whilst the organs themselves are all distinguished, they are not engendered in such wise and order that the similar parts are first formed, and the organic parts afterwards compounded from them; or so that certain composing parts existed before other compounded parts which must be fashioned from them. For although the head of the chick and the rest of the body exist in the shape of a mucus or soft jelly, whence each of the parts is afterwards formed in sequence, and all are of similar constitution in the first instance, still are they simultaneously produced and augmented in virtue of the same processes directed by the same agent; and in the same proportion as the matter resembling jelly increases, in like measure are the parts distinguished; for they are engendered, transmuted, and formed simultaneously; similar and dissimilar parts exist together, and from a small similar organ a larger one is produced. The thing, in short, is not otherwise than it is among vegetables, where from the straw proceeds the ear, the awns, and the grain — distinctly, severally, and yet together; or as trees put forth buds, from which are produced leaves, flowers, fruit, and finally seed.

All this we learn from an attentive study of the parts and processes of the incubated egg, inasmuch as from things done, actions or operations are apprehended; from operations, faculties or forces, and from these we then infer the artificer, generator, or cause. In the generation of the pullet, consequently, the actions or faculties of the engendering cause enumerated by Fabricius, namely, the metamorphic and formative, do not differ in kind, or even in the relation of sequence, as that one is first and the other second, but, as Aristotle is wont to say, are one and the same in reason; not as happens with reference to the actions of the nutritive faculty — attraction, concoction, distribution and apposition, to wit — which all come into play in several places at several times. Were this not so, the engendering cause itself would be forced to make use of various instruments in order to accomplish its various operations.

Fabricius, therefore, asserts erroneously that the transmutative force works with the properties of the elements — hot, cold, moist, and dry — as its instruments; whilst the formative faculty acts independently of these and by a more divine power, performing its task with consciousness, as it seems, with foresight and election. But if he had looked more closely at the matter he would have seen that the formative as well as the metamorphic force made use of the hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, as instruments; nor would he have been less struck with indications of the Supreme Artificer's interference in the processes of nutrition and transformation than in that of formation itself. For nature ordained each and all of these faculties to some definite end, and everywhere labours with forethought and intelligence.

## ANIMAL GENERATION

Whatever it is in the seeds of plants which renders them fertile and exercises a plastic force in their interior; whatever it is which in the egg performs the duty of a most skilful artificer, producing and fashioning the parts of the pullet, warming, cooling, moistening, drying, concocting, condensing, hardening, softening and liquefying at once, impressing distinctive characters on each of them by means of configuration, situation, constitution, temperament, number and order — still is this something at work, disposing and ordering all with no less of foresight, intelligence, and choice in the business of transmuting, than in the processes of nutrition, growth, and formation.

The concoctive and metamorphic, the nutritive and augmentive faculties, which Fabricius would have it act through the qualities of hot, cold, moist, and dry, without all consciousness, I maintain, on the contrary, work no less to a definite end, and with not less of artifice than the formative faculty, which Fabricius declares has knowledge and foresight of the future action and use of every particular part and organ. In the same way as the arts of the physician, cook, and baker, in which heat and cold, moisture and dryness, and similar natural properties are employed, require the use of reason no less than the mechanical arts in which either the hands or various instruments are employed, as in the business of the blacksmith, statuary, potter, &c.; in the same way, as in the greater world, we are told that “All things are full of Jove,” — *Jovis omnia plena* — so in the slender body of the pullet, and in every one of its actions, does the finger of God or nature no less obviously appear.

Wherefore, if from manifestations it be legitimate to judge of faculties, we might say that the vegetative acts appear rather to be performed with art, election, and foresight, than the acts of the rational soul and mind; and this even in the most perfect man, whose highest excellence in science and art, if we may take the God for our guide, is that he know himself.

A superior and more divine agent than man, therefore, appears to engender and preserve mankind, a higher power than the male bird to produce a young one from the egg. We acknowledge God, the supreme and omnipotent creator, to be present in the production of all animals, and to point, as it were, with a finger to his existence in his works, the parents being in every case but as instruments in his hands. In the generation of the pullet from the egg all things are indeed contrived and ordered with singular providence, divine wisdom, and most admirable and incomprehensible skill. And to none can these attributes be referred save to the Almighty, first cause of all things, by whatever name this has been designated, — the Divine Mind by Aristotle; the Soul of the Universe by Plato; the *Natura Naturans* by others; Saturn and Jove by the ancient Greeks and Romans; by ourselves, and as is seeming in these days, the Creator and Father of all that is in heaven and earth, on whom animals depend for their being, and at whose will and pleasure all things are and were engendered.

Moreover, as I have said, I neither hold this arrangement of the faculties of the vital principle, which Fabricius has placed at the head of his account of the organs of generation, as correct in itself, nor as useful or calculated to assist us in the matter we have in hand. For we do not attain to a knowledge of effects from a discussion of actions or faculties; the contrary is rather the case: from actions we ascend to a knowledge of faculties, inasmuch as manifestations are more cognizable to us than the powers whence they proceed, and the parts which we investigate already formed are more readily appreciated than the actions whence they proceed.

Neither is it well from the generation of a single chick from an egg, to venture upon general conclusions, which can in fact only be correctly arrived at after extensive observations on the mode of generation among animals at large. But of this matter I shall have more to say immediately.

Meantime, however, that we may come to the parts subservient to generation, as Fabricius says,

> “let us consider and perpend in what order the organs subserving generation are produced — which are formed first, which last. In this investigation two bases are to be laid, one having reference to the corporeal, the other to the incorporeal; that is to say, to nature and the vital principle. The corporeal base,” he continues, “I call that which depends on and proceeds from the nature of the body, and of which illustrations are readily supplied from things made by art; as for example, that every building requires a foundation upon which it may be established and reared; from whence walls are raised, by which both floors and ceilings are supported; then are all the supplementary parts added and ornaments appended: and so, in fact, does Nature strive in the construction of the animal body; for first she forms the bones

> as a foundation, in order that all the parts of the body may grow upon and be appended to and established around them. These are the parts, in other words, that are first formed and solidified; for as the bones derive their origin from a very soft and membranous substance, and by and by become extremely hard, much time is required to complete the formation of a bone, and it is therefore that they are first produced. Hence Galen did not compare the formation of the animal body to every kind of artificial structure, but particularly to a ship; for he says, as the commencement and foundation of a ship is the keel, from which the ribs, circularly curved, proceed on either side at moderate distances from each other, like the sticks of a hurdle, in order that the whole fabric of the vessel may afterwards be reared upon the keel as a suitable basis; so in the formation of the animal body does Nature, by means of the outstretched spine and the ribs drawn around it, secure a keel and suitable foundation for the entire superstructure, which she then raises and perfects.”^

But experience teaches us that all this is very different in fact, and that the bones are rather among the last parts to be formed. The bones of the extremities and skull, and the teeth, do not arise any sooner than the brain, the muscles, and the other fleshy parts: in new-born foetuses, perfect in other respects, the place of the bones is supplied by mere membranes or cartilages, which are only subsequently and in the lapse of time converted into bones; a circumstance which sufficiently appears in the crania of new-born infants, and in the state of their ribs and articulations.

And although it be true that the first rudiments of the body are seen in the guise of a recurved keel, still this is a soft mucous and jelly-like substance, which has no affinity in nature, structure, or office to bone; and although certain globules depend from thence, the destined rudiments of the head, still these contain no solid matter, but are mere vesicles full of limpid water, which are afterwards formed into the brain, cerebellum, and eyes, which are all subsequently surrounded by the skull, at a period, however, when the beak and nails have already acquired consistency and hardness.

This view of Fabricius is therefore both imperfect and incorrect; inasmuch as he does not think of what Nature performs in fact in the work of generation, so much as of what in his opinion she ought to do, betrayed into this by his comparison with the edifice reared by art. As if nature had imitated art, and not rather art nature! — mindful of which he himself says afterwards:

> “It were better to say that art learned of Nature, and was an imitator of her doings; for, as Galen everywhere reminds us, Nature is both older and displays greater wisdom in her works than art.”^

And then when we admit that the bones are the foundation of the whole body, without which it could neither support itself nor perform any movement, it is still sufficient if they arise simultaneously with the parts that are attached to them. And indeed the things that are to be supported not yet existing, the supports would be established in vain. Nature, however, does nothing in vain; nor does she form parts before there is a use for them. But animals receive their organs as soon as the offices of these are required. The first basis of Fabricius, therefore, is distinctly overthrown by his own observations on the egg, and the comparison drawn by Galen.

He appears to have come nearer the truth where he says:

> “The other basis of the parts to be formed first or last is obtained from nature, that is, from the vital principle by which the animal body is ruled and directed. If there be two grades of this principle, the vegetative and animal, the vegetative must be held prior in point of nature and time, inasmuch as it is common to plants and animals; and assuredly the organs officiating in the vegetative office will be engendered and formed before those that belong to the sensitive and motive principle, especially to the chief organs which are in immediate relationship with the governing principle. Now these organs are two in especial — the liver and the heart: the liver as seat of concupiscence, of the vegetative or nutritive faculty; the heart, as the organ whose heat maintains and perfects the vegetative and every other faculty, and in this way has most intimate connections and relations with the vegetative force. Whence, if after the third day you see the heart palpitating in the point where the chick is engendered, as Aristotle bears witness to the fact that you can, you will not be surprised but rather be disposed to admit that the heart belongs to the vegetative degree and exists for its sake. It is also consonant with reason that the liver should be engendered simultaneously with the heart, but should lie *perdue* or hidden, as it does not pulsate. And Aristotle himself admits that the heart and liver exist in

## ANIMAL GENERATION

> the animal body for similar reasons; so that where there is a heart there also is a liver discovered. If the heart and liver be the parts first produced, then, it is also fair to suppose that the other organs subserving these two should be engendered in the same manner — the lungs which exist for the sake of the heart; and, for the sake of the liver, almost all the viscera which present themselves in the abdomen.”^

Still is all this very different from the sequence we witness in the egg. Nor is it true that the liver is engendered simultaneously with the heart; nor does the salve avail with which he would cover that infirmity where he says that the liver is concealed because it does not palpitate; for the eyes and vena cava and Carina are all conspicuous enough from the commencement, although none of them palpitate. How come the liver and lungs, if they be then extant, to be visible without any palpitation? And then Fabricius himself has indicated a minute point situated in the centre of his figure of the chick of the fourth day, without stating, however, that it had any pulsation; and this he did not perceive to be the heart, but rather believed it to be the rudiment of the body. It is certain, therefore, that Fabricius spoke only from conjecture and preconceived opinion of the origin of the liver; even in the same way as others have done, Aldrovandus and Parisanus among the number, who, lighting upon two points, and perceiving that they did not pulsate simultaneously, straightway held that one was the heart, the other the liver. As if the liver ever pulsated, and these two points were aught but the two pulsating vesicles replying to each other by alternate contractions, in the way and manner we have indicated in our history!

Fabricius, therefore, is either deceived or deceives, when he says,

> “In the first stage of the production of the chick, the liver, heart, veins, arteries, lungs, and all the organs contained in the cavity of the abdomen, are engendered together; and in like manner are the Carina, in other words, the head with the eyes and entire vertebral column and thorax engendered.”

For the heart, veins, and arteries are perfectly distinguished some time before the Carina; the carina, again, is seen before the eyes; the eyes, beak, and sides before the organs contained in the cavity of the abdomen; the stomach and intestines before the liver or lungs; and there are still other particulars connected with the order of production of the parts in generation, of which we shall speak by and by.

He is also mistaken when he would have the vegetative portion of the vital principle prior in nature and time to the sensitive and motive element. For that which is prior in nature is mostly posterior in the order of generation. In point of time, indeed, the vegetative principle is prior; because without it the sensitive principle cannot exist: an act — if the act of an organic body — cannot take place without organs; and the sensitive and motive organs are the work of the vegetative principle; the sensitive soul before the existence of action, is like a triangle within a quadrangle. But nature intended that that which was primary and most noble should also be primary; wherefore the vegetative force is by nature posterior in point of order, as subordinate and ministrative to the sensitive and motive faculties.

### Exercise 55. Of the order of the parts according to Aristotle

The following appear to be Aristotle’s views of the order of generation:

> “When conception takes place, the germ comports itself like a seed sown in the ground. For seeds likewise contain a first principle, which, existing in the beginning *in potentia*, by and by when it manifests itself, sends forth a stem and a root, by which aliment is taken up; for increase is indispensable. And so in a conception, in which all the parts of the body inhere *in potentia*, and the first principle exists in a state of special activity.”^

This principle in the egg — the body analogous to the seed of a vegetable — we have called with Fabricius the spot or cicatricula, and have spoken of it as a very primary part of the egg, as that in which all the other parts inhere *in potentia*, and from whence each in its order afterwards arises. In this spot, in fact, is contained that — whatever it may be — by which the egg is made productive; and here is the first action of the formative faculty, the first effect of the vegetative heat revealed.

This spot, as we have said, dilates from the very commencement of the incubation, and expands in circles, in the centre of which a minute white speck is displayed, like the shining point in the pupil of the eye; and here anon is discovered the *punctum saliens rubrum*, with the ramifications of the sanguiferous vessels, and this as soon as the fluid, which we have called the colliquament, has been produced.

> “Wherefore,” adds Aristotle,^ “the heart is

446
> the first part perceived in fact; and this is in conformity not only with sense, but also with reason. For as that which is engendered is already disjunct and severed from both parents, and ought to rule and regulate itself like a son who comes of age and has his separate establishment, it must therefore possess a principle, an intrinsic principle, by which the order of the members may be subsequently determined, and whatever is necessary to the constitution of a perfect animal arranged. For if this principle were at any time extrinsic, and entered into the body at a subsequent period, you would not only be in doubt as to the time at which it entered, but as every part is distinct, you would also see it as necessary that that should first exist from which the other parts derive both increase and motion.”

The same writer elsewhere^ asserts:

> “This principle is a portion of the whole, and not anything added, or included apart. For,” he proceeds, “the generation of the animal completed, does this principle perish, or does it continue? But nothing can be shown existing intrinsically which is not a part of the whole organized being, whether it be plant or animal; wherefore it would be absurd to maintain that the principle in question perished after the formation either of any one or of any number of parts; for what should form those that were not yet produced? Wherefore,” he continues further, “they say not well who with Democritus assert that the external parts of animals are those first seen, and then the internal parts, as if they were rearing an animal of wood and stone, for such a thing would include no principle within itself. But all animals have and hold a principle in their interior. Wherefore the heart is seen as the first distinct part in animals that have blood; for it is the origin of all the parts, whether similar or dissimilar; and the creature that begins to feel the necessity of nourishment, must already be possessed by the principle of an animal and a full-grown foetus.”

From the above, it clearly appears that Aristotle recognizes a certain order and commencement in animal generation, namely, the heart, which he regards as the first produced and first vivified part of the animal, and, like a son set free from the tutelage of his parents, as self-sufficing and independent, whence not only does the order of the parts proceed, but as that by which the animal itself is maintained and preserved, receiving from it at once life and sustenance, and everything needful to the perfection of its being. For as Seneca says:

> “In the semen is comprised the entire cause of the future man; and the unborn babe has written within it the law of a beard and a hoary head. For the whole body and the load of future years are already traced in delicate and obscure outlines in its constitution.”^

We have already determined whether the heart were this primigenial part or not; in other words, whether Aristotle’s words refer to that part which, in the dissection of animals, is seen sooner than all the rest, the *punctum saliens*, to wit, with its vessels full of blood; and we have cordially assented to an answer in the affirmative. For I believe that the blood, together with its immediate instruments, the umbilical vessels, by which, as by roots, nutriment is attracted, and the pulsating vesicles, by which this nutriment is distributed, to maintain life and growth in every other part, are formed first and foremost of all. For as Aristotle^ has said, it is the same matter by which a thing grows, and by which it is primarily constituted.

Many, however, err in supposing that different parts of the body require different kinds of matter for their nourishment. As if nutrition were nothing more than the selection and attraction of fit aliment; and in the several parts of the body to be nourished, no concoction, assimilation, apposition, and transmutation were required. This as we learn, was the opinion of Anaxagoras of old:

> Who held the principles of things to be
> *Homoeomeric*: — bone to be produced
> Of small and slender bones; the viscera
> Of small and slender viscera; the blood
> Of numerous associate drops of blood.^

But Aristotle, with the greatest propriety, observes:

> “Distinction of parts is not effected, as some think, by like being carried by its nature to like; for, besides innumerable difficulties belonging to this opinion in itself, it happens that each similar part is severally created; for example, the bones by themselves, the nerves, the flesh, &c.”^

But the nourishment of all parts is common and homogeneous, such as we see the albumen to be in the egg, not heterogeneous and composed of different parts. Wherefore all we have said of the matter from which parts are made, is to be stated of that by which they increase: all derive nourishment from that in which they exist *in potential* though not in act. Precisely as from the same rain plants of every kind increase and grow; because the moisture which was a like power in reference to all, becomes actually like to each when it is changed into their substances severally: then does it acquire bitterness in rue, sharpness in mustard, sweetness in liquorice, and so on.

He explains, moreover, what parts are engendered before others, and assigns a reason which does not differ from the second basis of Fabricius.

> “The cause by which, and the cause of this cause, are different; one is first in generation, the other in essence”;

by which we are to understand that the end is prior in nature and essence to that which happens for the sake of the end; but that which happens for the sake of the end must be prior in generation. And on this ground Fabricius rightly infers that all those parts which minister to the vegetative principle are engendered before those that serve the sensitive principle, inasmuch as the former is subordinate to the latter.

He subsequently adds the differences of those parts which are made for some special purpose: some parts, for example, are instituted for a purpose by nature, because this purpose ensues;

and others because they are instruments which the purpose employs. The former he designates *genitalia*, the latter instrumental. For the end or purpose, he says, in some cases, is posterior, in others prior to that which is its cause. For both the generator and the instruments it uses must exist anteriorly to that which is engendered by or from them. The parts serving the vegetative principle, therefore, are prior to the parts which are the ministers of sense and motion. But the parts dedicated to motion and sensation are posterior to the motive and sensitive faculties, because they are the instruments which the motive and sensitive faculties employ. For it is a law of nature that no parts or instruments be produced before there be some use for them, and the faculty be extant which employs them. Thus there is neither an eye nor a motive organ engendered until the brain is produced, and the faculties pre-exist which are to see and to govern motion.

In like manner, as the pulsating vesicles serve as instruments for the motion of the blood, and the heart in its entire structure does the same (as I have shown in the work *On the Motion of the Blood*), urging the blood in a ceaseless round through every part of the body, we see that the blood must exist before the heart, both in the order of generation and of nature and essence. For the blood uses the heart as an instrument, and moreover, when engendered it continues to nourish the organ by means of the coronary arteries, distributing heat, spirits, and life to it through their ramifications.

We shall have further occasion to show from an entire series of anatomical observations, how this rule of Aristotle in respect of the true priority of the parts is borne out. Meantime we shall see how he himself succeeds in duly inferring the causes of priority in conformity with his rule.

> “After the prime part — viz., the heart — is engendered,” he says, “the internal parts are produced before the external ones, the superior before the inferior; for the lower parts exist for the sake of the superior, and that they may serve as instruments, after the manner of the seeds of vegetables, which produce roots sooner than branches.”

Nature, however, follows no such order in generation; nor is the instance quoted invariably applicable; for in beans, peas, and other leguminous seeds, in acorns, also, and in grain, it is easy to see that the stem shoots upwards and the root downwards from the same germ: and onions and other bulbous plants send out stalks before they strike root.

He then subjoins another cause of this order, viz.:
> “That as Nature does nothing in vain or superfluously, it follows that she makes nothing either sooner or later than the use she has for it requires.”

That is to say, those parts are first engendered whose use or function is first required; and some are begun at an earlier period because a longer time is requisite to bring them to perfection; and that so they may be in the same state of forwardness at birth as those that are more rapidly produced. Just as the cook, having to dress certain articles for supper, which by reason of their hardness are done with difficulty, or require gentle boiling for a great length of time, these he puts on first, and only subsequently turns to those that are prepared more quickly and with less expenditure of heat; and further, as he makes ready the articles that are to come on in the first course first of all, and those that are to be presented in the second course afterwards; so also does Nature in the generation of animals only proceed at a later period to the construction of the soft and moist and fleshy parts, as requiring but a short time for their concoction and formation, whilst the hard parts, such as the bones, as requiring ample evaporation and abundant drying, and their matter long remaining inconcoct, she proceeds to fashion almost from the very beginning.
> “And the same thing obtains in the brain,” he adds, “which, large in quantity and exceedingly moist at first, is by and by better concocted and condensed, so that the brain as well as the eye diminishes in size. The head is, therefore, very large at first, in comparison with the rest of the body, which it far surpasses because of the brain and the eyes, and the large quantity of moisture contained in them. These parts, nevertheless, are among the last to be perfected, for the brain acquires consistence with difficulty, and it is long before it is freed from cold and moisture in any animal, and especially in man. The sinciput, too, is consolidated the last, the bones here being quite soft when the infant sees the light.”

He gives another reason, viz., because the parts are formed of different kinds of matter:
> “Every more excellent part, the sharer in the highest principle is, further, engendered from the most highly concocted, the purest and first nutriment; the other needful parts, produced for the sake of the former, from the worse and excrementitious remainder. For Nature, like the sage head of a family, is wont to throw away nothing that may be turned to any useful purpose. But he still regulates his household so that the best food shall be given to his children, the more indifferent to his menials, the worst to the animals. As then, man’s growth being complete and mind having been superadded (in other words, and, as I interpret the passage, adult man having acquired sense and prudence), things are ordered in this way, so does Nature at the period of production even compose the flesh and the other more sensitive parts of the purest matter. Of the excrementitious remainder she makes the bones, sinews, hair, nails, and other parts of the same constitution. And this is the reason why this is done last of all, when Nature has an abundant supply of recrementitious material.”

Our author then goes on to speak of “a twofold order of aliment”: “one for nutrition, another for growth”; “the nutritive is the one which supplies existence to the whole and to the parts; the augmentative, that which causes increase to the bulk.”

This is in accordance with what we find in the egg, where the albumen supplies a kind of purer aliment adapted to the nutrition of the embryo in its earlier stages, and the yelk affords the material for the growth of the chick and pullet. The thinner albumen, moreover, as we have seen, is used in fashioning the first and more noble parts; the thicker albumen and the yelk, again, are employed in nourishing and making these to grow, and further in forming the less important parts of the body.
> “For,” he says, “the sinews, too, are produced in the same way as the bones, and from the same material, viz.: the seminal and nutritive excrementitious matter. But the nails, hair, horns, beak, and spurs of birds, and all other things of the same description, are engendered of the adventitious and nutritive aliment, which is obtained both from the mother and from without.”

And then he gives a reason why man, whilst other animals are endowed by nature with defensive and offensive arms, is born naked and defenceless, which is this: that whilst in the lower animals these parts are formed of remainders or excrements, man is compounded of a purer material, “which contains too small a quantity of inconcoct and earthy matter.”

Thus far have we followed Aristotle on the subject of “The Order in Generation,” the whole of which seems to be referrible to one principle, viz.: the perfection of Nature, who in her works does nothing in vain and has no shortcomings, but still does that in the best manner which was best to be done. Hence in generation no part would either precede or follow, did she prefer producing them altogether, viz.: in circumstances where she acts freely and by election; for sometimes she works under compulsion, as it were, and beside her purpose, as when through deficiency or superabundance of material, or through some defect in her instruments, or is hindered of her ends by external injuries. And thus it occasionally happens that the final parts are formed before the instrumental parts — understanding by final parts, those that use others as instruments.

And as some of the parts are genital, nature making use of them in the generation of other parts, as the means of removing obstacles the presence of which would interfere with the due progress of the work of reproduction, and others exist for other special ends; it therefore happens that for the disposition of material, and other requisites, some parts are variously engendered before others, some of them being begun earlier but completed at a later period, some being both begun and perfected at an earlier period, and others being begun together but perfected at different times subsequently. And then the same order is not observed in the generation of all animals, but this is variously altered; and in some there is nothing like succession, but all the parts are begun and perfected simultaneously, by metamorphosis, to wit, as has been already stated. Hence it follows, in fine, that the primogenate part must be of such a nature as to contain both the beginning and the end, and be that for whose sake all the rest is made, namely, the living principle, or soul, and that which is the potential and genital cause of this, the heart, or in our view the blood, which we regard as the prime seat of the soul, as the source and perennial centre of life, as the generative heat, and indeed as the inherent heat; in a word, the heart is the first efficient of the whole of the instrumental parts that are produced for the ends of the soul, and used by it as instruments. The heart, according to Aristotle, I say, is that for which all the parts of animals are made, and it is at the same time that which is at once the origin and fashioner of them all.

## EXERCISE 56. Of the order of the parts in generation as it appears from observation

That we may now propose our own views of the order of the parts in generation as we have gathered it from our observations, it appears that the whole business of generation in all animals may be divided into two periods, or connected with two structures: the ovum, i. e., the conception and seed, or that, whatever it be, which in spontaneous productions corresponds to the seed, whether with Fernelius it be called “the native celestial heat in the primogenial moisture,” or with Aristotle, “the vital heat included in moisture.” For the conception in viviparous animals, as we have said, is analogous to the seed and fruit of plants; in the same way as it is to the egg of oviparous creatures; to worms in spontaneously engendered animals, or to certain vesicles fruitful by the vital warmth of their included moisture. In each and all of these the same things inhere which might with propriety lead to their being called seeds; they are all bodies, to wit, from which and by which, as previously existing matter, artificer and organ, the whole of an animal body is primarily engendered and produced.

The other structure is the embryo produced from the seed or conception. For both the matter and the moving and efficient cause, and the instruments needful to the operation, must necessarily precede operation of any and every kind.

We have already examined the structure of the egg. Now the embryo to which it gives birth, in so far as this can be made out by observation and dissection, particularly among the more perfect animals with blood, appears to be perfected by four principal degrees or processes, which we reduce to as many orders, in harmony with the various epochs in generation; and we shall demonstrate that what transpires in the egg also takes place in every conception or seed.

### The first process is that of the primogenial and genital part, viz., the blood with its receptacles, in other words, the heart and its vessels.

And this part is first engendered for two principal reasons: 1st, because it is the principal part which uses all the rest as instruments, and for whose sake the other parts are formed; and, 2nd, because it is the prime genital part, the origin and author of the rest. The part, in a word, in which inhere both the principle whence motion is derived, and the end of that motion, is obviously father and sovereign.

In the generation of this first part, which in the egg is accomplished in the course of the fourth day, although I have not been able to observe any order or sequence, inasmuch as the whole of its elements — the blood, the vessels, and the pulsating vesicles — appear simultaneously, I have nevertheless imagined, as I have said, that the blood exists before the pulse, because, according to nature’s laws, it must be antecedent to its receptacles. For the substance and structure of the heart, namely, the conical mass with its auricles and ventricles, as they are produced long subsequently along with the other viscera, so must they be referred to the same class of parts as these, namely, the third.

In the production of the circulating system the veins are sooner seen than the arteries; such at least is our conclusion.

### The second process, which begins after the fourth day, is indicated by a certain concrescence, which I designate *vermiculum* — worm or maggot; for it has the life and obscure motions of a maggot; and as it concretes into a mucous matter, it divides into two parts, the larger and superior of which is seen to be conglobed, and divided, as it were, into thin vesicles — the brain, the cerebellum, and the two eyes; the less, again, constituting the *carina*, arises over the *vena cava* and extends in the line of its direction.

In the genesis of the head, the eyes are first perceived; by and by a white point makes its appearance in the situation of the beak, and the slime drying around it, it becomes invested with a membrane.

The outline of the rest of the body follows about the same period. First, from the *carina* something like the sides of a ship are seen to arise; the parts having a uniform consistence in the beginning, but the ribs being afterwards prefigured by means of extremely fine white lines. The instruments of locomotion next arise — the legs and wings; and the *carina* and the extremities adnate to it are then distinguished into muscles, bones, and articulations.

These two rudiments of the head and trunk appear simultaneously, but as they grow and advance to perfection subsequently, the trunk increases and acquires its shape much more speedily than the head; so that this, which in the first instance exceeded the whole trunk in size, is now relatively much smaller. And the same thing occurs in regard to the human embryo.

The same disparity also takes place between the trunk and the extremities. In the human embryo, from the time when it is not longer than the nail of the little finger, till it is of the size of a frog or mouse, the arms are so short that the extremities of the fingers could not extend across the breast, and the legs are so short that were they reflected on the abdomen they would not reach the umbilicus.

The proportion of the body to the extremities in children after their birth continues excessive until they begin to stand and run. Infants, therefore, resemble dwarfs in the beginning, and they creep about like quadrupeds, attempting progressive motion with the assistance of all their extremities; but they cannot stand erect until the length of the leg and thigh together exceeds the length of the rest of the body. And so it happens, that when they first attempt to walk, they move with the body prone, like the quadruped, and can scarcely rise so erect as the common dunghill fowl.

And so it happens that among adult men the long-legged — they who have longer legs, and especially longer thighs — are better walkers, runners, and leapers than square-built, compact men.

In this second process many actions of the formative faculty are observed following each other in regular order (in the same way as we see one wheel moving another in *automata*, and other pieces of mechanism), and all arising from the same mucaginous and similar matter. Not indeed in the manner that some natural philosophers would have it when they say “that like is carried to its like.” We are rather to maintain that parts are moved, not changing their places, but remaining and undergoing change in hardness, softness, colour, &c., whence the diversities between similar parts; those things appearing in act which were before in power. [^1] The extremities, spine, and rest of the body, namely, are formed, grow, and acquire outline and complexion together; the extremities, comprising bones, muscles, tendons, and cartilages, all of which on their first appearance were similar and homogeneous, become distinguished in their progress, and, connected together, compose organs, by whose mutual continuity the whole body is constituted. In like manner, the membrane growing around the head, the brain is composed, and the lustrous eyes receive their polish out of a perfectly limpid fluid.

That is to say, Nature sustains and augments the several parts by the same nourishment with which she fashioned them at first, and not, as many opine, with any diversity of aliment and particles similar to each particular structure. As she is increasing the mucaginous mass or maggot, like a potter she first divides her material, and then indicates the head and trunk and extremities; like a painter, she first sketches the parts in outline, and then fills them in with colours; or like the shipbuilder, who first lays down his keel by way of foundation, and upon this raises the ribs and roof or deck: even as he builds his vessel does Nature fashion the trunk of the body and add the extremities. And in this work she orders all the variety of similar parts—the bones, cartilages, membranes, muscles, tendons, nerves, &c.—from the same primary jelly or mucus. For thick filaments are produced in the first instance, and these by and by are brought to resemble cords; then they are rendered cartilaginous and spinous; and, lastly, they are hardened and concocted into bones. In the same way the thicker membrane which invests the brain is first cartilaginous and then bony, whilst the thinner membrane merely consolidates into the pericranium and integument. In similar order flesh and nerve from soft mucus are confirmed into muscle, tendon, and ligament; the brain and cerebellum are condensed out of a perfectly limpid water into a firm coagulum; for the brain of infants, before the bones of the head have closed, is soft and diffluent, and has no greater consistence than the curd of milk.

### The third process is that of the viscera, the formation of which in the chick takes place after the trunk is cast in outline, or about the sixth or seventh day — the liver, lungs, kidneys, cone and ventricles of the heart, and intestines, all become visible nearly at the same moment;

they appear to arise from the veins, and to be connected with them in the same way as fungi grow upon the bark of trees. They are, as I have already said, gelatinous, white, and bloodless, until they take on their proper functions. The stomach and intestines are first discovered as white and tortuous filaments extending lengthwise through the abdomen; along with these the mouth appears, from which a continuous canal extends to the anus, and connects the superior with the inferior parts. The organs of generation likewise appear about the same time.

Up to this period all the viscera, the intestines, and the heart itself inclusive, are excluded from the cavities of the body and hang pendulous without, attached as it were to the veins. The trunk of the body presents itself, in fact, like a boat undecked or a house without a roof, the anterior walls of the thorax and abdomen not being yet extant to close these cavities.

But as soon as the sternum is fashioned the heart enters into the chest as into a dwelling which it had built and arranged for itself; and there, like the tutelary genius, it enters on the government of the surrounding mansion, which it inhabits with its ministering servants the lungs. The liver and stomach are by and by included within the hypochondria, and the intestines are finally surrounded by the abdominal parietes. And this is the reason wherefore without dissection the heart can no longer be seen pulsating in the hen’s egg after the tenth day of incubation.

About this epoch the point of the beak and the nails appear of a fine white colour; a quantity of chylous matter presents itself in the stomach; a little excrement is also observed in the intestine, and the liver being now begun, some greenish bile is perceived; facts from which it clearly appears that there is another digestion and preparation of nutriment going on besides that which takes place by the branches of the umbilical veins; and it is reasonable matter of doubt how the bile, the excrementitious matter of the second digestion, can be separated by the instrumentality of the liver from the other humours, when we see it produced at the same time as this organ.

In the order now indicated are the internal organs generated universally; in all the animals which I have dissected, particularly the more perfect ones, and man himself, I have found them produced in the same manner: in these, in the course of the second, third, and fourth month, the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and intestines present themselves inchoate and increasing, and all alike of the same white colour which belongs to the body at large. Wherefore these early days are not improperly spoken of as the days when the embryo is in the milk; for with the exception of the veins, particularly those of the umbilicus, everything is as it were spermatic in appearance.

I am of opinion that the umbilical arteries arise after the veins of the same name, because the arteries are scarcely to be discovered in the course of the first month, and take their rise from the branches that descend to either lower extremity. I do not believe, therefore, that they exist until that part of the body whence they proceed is formed. The umbilical veins, on the contrary, are conspicuous long before any part of the body is begun.

What I have now said I have derived from numerous dissections of human embryos of almost every size; for I have had them for inspection from the time they were like tadpoles, till they were seven or eight fingers’ breadth in length, and from thence onwards to the full time. I have examined them more particularly, however, through the second, third, and fourth months, in the course of which the greatest number of changes take place, and the order of development is seen with greatest clearness.

In the human embryo, then, of the age of two months, what we have spoken of as taking place in the “second process,” is observed to occur. For I rather think that during the first month there is scarcely anything of the conception in the uterus — at all events, I have never been able to discover anything. But the first month past, I have repeatedly seen conceptions thrown off, and similar to the one which Hippocrates mentions as having been voided by the female pipe-player, of the size of a pheasant’s or pigeon’s egg. Such conceptions resemble an egg without its shell; they are, namely, of an oval figure; the thicker membrane or chorion with which they are surrounded, however, is seen to be covered with a white mucor externally, particularly towards the larger end; internally it is smooth and shining, and is filled with limpid and sluggish water — it contains nothing else.

In the course of the second month I have frequently seen an ovum of this description, or somewhat larger, thrown off with the symptoms of abortion, viz., ichorous lochia; the ovum being sometimes entire, at other times burst, and covered with bloody coagula. Within it was smooth and slippery; it was covered with adhering blood without. Its form was that which I have just described. In some of these aborted ova, I have discovered embryos, in others I could find none. The embryo, when present, was of the length of the little finger-nail, and in shape like a little frog, save that the head was exceedingly large and the extremities very short, like a tadpole in the month of June, when it gets its extremities, loses its tail, and assumes the form of a frog. The whole substance was white, and so soft and mucilaginous, that unless immersed in clear water, it was impossible to handle it. The face was the same as that of the embryo of one of the lower animals — the dog or cat, for instance, without lips, the mouth gaping, and extending from ear to ear.

Many women, whose conceptions, like the wind eggs of fowls, are barren and without an embryo, miscarry in the third month.

I have occasionally examined aborted ova of this age, of the size of a goose’s egg, which contained embryos distinct in all their parts, but misshapen. The head, eyes, and extremities were distinct, but the muscles were indistinct; there were no bones, but certain white lines in their situations, and as it seemed, soft cartilages. The substance of the heart was extremely white, and consisted of two ventricles of like size and thickness of walls, forming a cone with a double apex, which might be compared to a small twin-kernel nut. The liver was very small and of the general white colour. Through the whole of this time, i.e., during the first three months, there is scarcely any appearance of a placenta or uterine cake.

In every conception of this description I have seen, I have always found a surrounding membrane containing a large quantity of watery fluid, between which and the body of the embryo, suspended by its middle by means of a long and twisted umbilical cord, there is such disproportion, that it is impossible to regard this liquid as either sweat or urine; it seems far more probable that like the colliquament in the hen’s egg, it is a fluid destined by nature for the nourishment of the foetus. Nor was there any indication to be discovered of these conceptions or ova having been connected with the uterus; there was only on the external surface of their larger extremity a greater appearance of thickening and wrinkling, as if the rudiments of the future placenta had existed there.

These conceptions, therefore, appear to me in the light of ova, which are merely cherished within the uterus, and, like the egg in the uterus of the fowl, grow by their own inherent powers.

### In the fourth month, however, it is wonderful to find what rapid strides the foetus has made;

from the length of the thumb it has now grown to be a span long. All the members, too, are distinct and are tinged with blood; the bones and muscles can be distinguished; there are vestiges of the nails, and the foetus now begins to move lustily. The head, however, is excessively large; the face without lips, cheeks, and nose; the gape of the mouth is enormous, and the tongue lies in its middle; the eyes are small, without lids to cover them; the middle integument.

[^1]: *On the Generation of Animals*, ii. j.

The commencement of the regions of the forehead and sinciput is not yet cartilaginous, far less bony; but the occiput is somewhat firm and in some sort cartilaginous, indicating that the skull already begins to acquire solidity.

The organs of generation have now made their appearance, but the testes are contained within the abdomen, in the situation of the female uterus, the scrotum still remaining empty. The female organs are yet imperfect, and the uterus with its tubes resembles the two-horned uterus of the lamb.

The placenta, of larger size, and now attached to the uterus, comprises nearly one half of the entire conception, and presented itself to my eye as a fleshy or fungous excrescence of the womb, so firmly was its gibbous portion connected all around with the uterine walls, which had now grown to greater thickness. The branches of the umbilical vessels struck into the placenta like the roots of a tree into the ground, and by their means was the conception now, for the first time, connected with the uterus.

The brain presented itself as a large and soft coagulum, full of ample vessels. The ventricles of the heart were of equal capacity, and their walls of the same thickness. In the thorax, and covered by the ribs, three cavities, nearly of the same dimensions, were perceived; of these the lowest was occupied by the lungs, which are full of blood, and of the same colour as the liver and kidneys; the middle cavity was filled by the heart and pericardium; the superior cavity, again, was possessed by the gland called the thymus, which is now of very ample size.

In the stomach there was some chyle discovered, not very different in character from the fluid in which the embryo swam. It also contained some white curdled matter, not unlike the mucous sordes which the nurse washes particularly from between the folds of the skin of new-born infants. In the upper part of the intestines there was a small quantity of excrementitious or chylous matter; the lower bowels contained meconium. In the urinary bladder there was urine, and in the gall bladder bile. The *intestinum caecum*, that appendix of the colon, was empty as in the adult, and apparently superfluous, not as in the lower animals—the hog, horse, hare—constituting, as it were, another stomach. The omentum, or apron, floated over the intestines at large like a thin and transparent veil or cloud.

The kidneys at this epoch are not yet formed into a smooth and continuous rounded mass, as in the adult, but are compacted of numerous smaller masses, as we see them in the calf and sturgeon, as if there were a renal globule or nipple placed at the extremity of each division of the ureter, from the orifice of which the urine distilled. Over the kidneys two bodies, first observed by Eustachius, are discovered, very abundantly supplied with blood, so that their veins, which anatomists designate as *venae adiposae*, are not much smaller than the emulgents themselves. The liver and spleen, according to their several proportions, are equally full of blood.

I may here observe, by the way, that in every strong and healthy human foetus we everywhere discover milk; it is particularly abundant in the thymus gland, though it is also found in the pancreas, through the whole of the mesentery, and in certain lacteal veins and glands, as it seems, situated between the divisions of the mesenteric vessels. Moreover, it can be pressed and indeed sometimes flows spontaneously from the breasts of newly-born infants, and nurses imagine that this is beneficial to the infant.

And it clearly appears that this fluid, which abounds in the ovum, is no excrementitious matter thrown off by the embryo, nothing like urine or sweat, because its relative quantity is diminished as the period of parturition approaches, when the foetus is, of course, larger, and, as it consumes a greater quantity of nutriment, accumulates excrementitious matter more abundantly than it did in the first months of pregnancy. Let it be added, that the bladder is at this time distended with urine. For my own part I have never been able to discover that conduit for the urine, from the bladder to the umbilicus, which anatomists describe under the name of *urachus*; I have, on the contrary, frequently seen urine escaping by the penis, but never by any *urachus*, when the bladder was pressed upon with the hand.

So much for what I have observed with reference to the order of the parts in the development of the human foetus.

In the fourth and last process the parts of the lowest state and order are produced, those, namely, that do not exist as needful to the being or to the maintenance of the individual, but only as defences against external injury, as ornaments, or as weapons of offence.

The outermost part of all, the skin, with its several appendages, cuticle, hair, wool, feathers, scales, shells, claws, hooves, and other items of the same description, may be regarded as the principal means of defence or protection. And it is well devised by Nature, who, indeed, never does aught amiss, that these parts are the last to be engendered, inasmuch as they could never be of use or avail as defences until the animal was born. The common domestic pullet is, therefore, born covered with down only, not with feathers, like certain other birds which have to be speedily prepared for flight, because it has to seek its food on foot, not on the wing, and by active running about hither and thither. In like manner the young of ducks and geese, which feed swimming, have their feathers and wings perfected at a later period than their feet and legs. It is otherwise with swallows, however, which have to fly sooner than to walk, because they feed on the wing.

The down of the pullet begins to appear after the fourteenth day, the foetus being already perfect in all its parts. When the feathers first show themselves, they are in the guise of points within the skin, but by and by the feathers project, like plants from the ground, increase in length, become unfolded, invest the whole body, and protect it against the inclemencies of the atmosphere.

Feathers differ from quills in form, use, place of growth, and order of production. The pullet is feathered before it has any quills, for the quill-feathers only grow in the wings and tail, and also spring more deeply, from the very lowest part of the integument, or even from the periosteum, and serve essentially as instruments of motion; the feathers again arise superficially from the skin, and are everywhere present as means of protection.

“Nails, hair, horn, and the like,” says Aristotle, [^1] “are engendered from the skin; whence it happens that they change colour with the skin; for the white and black and particoloured are so in consequence of the colour of the skin whence they arise.” In the bird, however, this is not so; for whatever the colour of the feathers, the skin is still never otherwise than of one tint, viz., white. And then the same feather or quill is frequently seen of different and often brilliant colours in different parts for the ornament of the creature.

In the human foetus the skin and all the parts connected with it are in like manner perfected the last of all. In the earlier periods, consequently, we find neither lips, cheeks, external ears, eyelids, nor nose; and the last part to grow together is the upper lip in the course of the middle line of the body.

Man comes into the world naked and unarmed, as if Nature had destined him for a social creature, and ordained him to live under equitable laws and in peace; as if she had desired that he should be guided by reason rather than be driven by force; therefore did she endow him with understanding, and furnish him with hands, that he might himself contrive what was necessary to his clothing and protection. To those animals to which nature has given vast strength, she has also presented weapons in harmony with their powers; to those that are not thus vigorous, she has given ingenuity, cunning, and singular dexterity in avoiding injury.

Ornaments of all kinds, such as tufts, crests, combs, wattles, brilliant plumage, and the like, of which some vain creatures seem not a little proud, to say nothing of such offensive weapons as teeth, horns, spurs, and other implements employed in combat, are more frequently and remarkably conferred upon the male than the female. And it is not uninteresting to remark, that many of these ornaments or weapons are most conspicuous in the male at that epoch when the females come into season, and burn with desire of engendering. And whilst in the young they are still absent, in the aged they also fail as being no longer wanted.

Our common cock, whose pugnacious qualities are well known, so soon as he comes to his strength and is possessed of the faculty of engendering, is distinguished by his spurs, and ornamented with his comb and beautiful feathers, by which he charms his mates to the rites of Venus, and is furnished for the combat with other males, the subject of dispute being no empty or vainglorious matter, but the perpetuation of the stock in this line or in that; as if nature had intended that he who could best defend himself and his, should be preferred to others for the continuance of the kind. And indeed all animals which are better furnished with weapons of offence, and more warlike than others, fall out and fight, either in defence of their young, of their nests or dens, or of their prey; but more than all for the possession of their females. Once vanquished, they yield up possession of these, lay aside their strut and haughty demeanour, and, crestfallen and submissive, they seem to consume with grief; the victor, on the contrary, who has gained possession of the females by his prowess, exults and boastfully proclaims the glory of his conquest.

Nor is this ornamenting anything adventitious and for a season only; it is a lasting and special gift of Nature, who has not been studious to deck out animals, and especially birds only, but has also thrown an infinite variety of beautiful dyes over the lowly and insensate herbs and flowers.

## EXERCISE 57. Of certain paradoxes and problems to be considered in connexion with this subject

Thus far have we spoken of the order of generation, whereby the differences between those creatures that are engendered by metamorphosis and those that are developed by epigenesis, as well as between those that are said to proceed from a worm and those that arise from an egg, have been made to appear. The latter are partly incorporated from a prepared matter, and are nourished and increased from a certain remaining matter; the former are incorporated from the whole of the matter present; the latter grow and are formed simultaneously, and after their birth continue to wax in size and finally attain maturity; the former increase at once, and from a grub or caterpillar grow into an aurelia, and are then produced, consummately formed, as butterflies, moths, and the like. Wherefore Aristotle, as Fabricius [^2] observes: “As he assigns a sort of twofold nature to the egg, and a twofold egg in this kind, so does he assert a twofold action and a twofold animal engendered. For,” he proceeds, “from the first eggs, which are the primordia of generation, a worm is constantly produced; viz.: from the eggs of flies, ants, bees, silkworms, &c., in which some fluid is contained, and from the whole of which fluid the worm is engendered; but from the second eggs, formed by the worms themselves, butterflies are engendered and disclosed, viz.: flying animals contained in a shell, or follicle, or egg, which shell giving way the winged creature escapes; precisely as Aristotle [^3] has it where he speaks of the egg of the locust.” Finally, whilst the higher animals produced from eggs are perfected by a succession of parts, the lower creatures that arise in this way, or that are formed by metamorphosis, are produced at one effort, as it were, and entire. And in the same way are engendered both those creatures that are said to arise spontaneously, by chance or accident, and derive their first matter or take their origin from putrefaction, filth, excrement, dew, or the parts of plants and animals, as well as those that arise congenerately from the semen of animals. Because this is common to all living creatures, viz.: that they derive their origin either from semen or eggs, whether this semen have proceeded from others of the same kind, or have come by chance or something else. For what sometimes happens in art occasionally occurs in nature also; those things, namely, take place by chance or accident which otherwise are brought about by art. Of this Aristotle [^4] quotes health as an illustration. And the thing is not different as respects the generation, in so far as it is from seed, of certain animals: their semina are either present by accident, or they proceed from an univocal agent of the same kind. For even in fortuitous semina there is an inherent motive principle of generation, which procreates from itself and of itself; and this is the same as that which is found in the semina of congenerative animals,—a power, to wit, of forming a living creature. But of this matter we shall have more to say shortly.

From what has just been said, however, several paradoxes present themselves for consideration. For when we see the cicatricula enlarging in the egg, the colliquament concocted and prepared, and a variety of other particulars all tending, not without foresight, to the development of the embryo, before the first rudiment or the merest particle of this is conspicuous, what should hinder us from believing that the *calidum innatum* and the vegetative soul of the chick are in existence before the chick itself? For what is competent to produce the effects and acts of life, except their efficient cause and principle, heat, namely, and the faculty of the vegetative soul? Therefore it would seem that the soul was not the act of the organic body possessing life in potential; for we regard the chick with its appropriate form as the consequence of such an act. But where can we suppose the form and vital principle of the chick to inhere save in the chick itself unless indeed we admitted a separation of forms and conceded a certain metamorphosis.

Now this appears most obviously where the same animal lives, as Aristotle has it, by or under a succession of forms, for example, a caterpillar, a chrysalis, a butterfly. For it is of necessity the same efficient, nutrient, and conservative principle that possesses each of these, although under different forms; unless we allow that there is one vital principle in the youth, another in the man, a third in the aged individual, or maintain that the forms of the grub and caterpillar are the same as those of the silkworm and butterfly. Aristotle has entered very fully into this subject, and we shall ourselves have more to say on it immediately.

It appears further paradoxical to maintain that the blood is produced, and moves to and fro, and is imbued with vital spirits, before any sanguiferous or locomotive organs are in existence. Neither is it less new and unheard-of to assert that sensation and motion belong to the foetus before the brain is formed; for the foetus moves, contracting and unfolding itself, when there is nothing more than a little limpid water in the place of the brain.

Moreover, the body is nourished and increases before the organs appropriated to digestion, viz., the stomach and abdominal viscera, are formed. Sanguification, too, which is entitled the second digestion, is perfect before the first, or chylification, which takes place in the stomach, is begun. The excrementitious products of the first and second digestions, namely, excrement in the intestines, urine and bile in the urinary and gall bladder, are contemporaneous with the existence of the concocting organs themselves. Lastly, not only is there a soul or vital principle present in the vegetative part, but even before this there is inherent mind, foresight, and understanding, which from the very commencement to the being and perfect formation of the chick, dispose and order and take up all things requisite, moulding them in the new being, with consummate art, into the form and likeness of its parents.

In reference to this subject of family likeness, we may be permitted to inquire as to the reason why the offspring should at one time bear a stronger resemblance to the father, at another to the mother, and, at a third, to progenitors, both maternal and paternal, farther removed? particularly in cases where at one bout, and at the same moment, several ova are fecundated. And this too is a remarkable fact, that virtues and vices, marks and moles, and even particular dispositions to disease are transmitted by parents to their offspring; and that while some inherit in this way, all do not. Among our poultry some are courageous, and pugnaciously inclined, and will sooner die than yield and flee from an adversary; their descendants, once or twice removed, however, unless they have come of equally well-bred parents, gradually lose this quality; according to the adage, “the brave are begotten by the brave.” In various other species of animals, and particularly in the human family, a certain nobility of race is observed; numerous qualities, in fact, both of mind and body, are derived by hereditary descent.

I have frequently wondered how it should happen that the offspring, mixed in so many particulars of its structure or constitution, with the stamp of both parents so obviously upon it, in so many parts, should still escape all mixture in the organs of generation; that it should so uniformly prove either male or female, so very rarely an hermaphrodite.

Lastly, many things are present before they appear, and some are begun among the very first which are completed among the very last, such as the eyes, the organs of generation, and the beak.

Several doubts and difficulties have thence arisen as to the principality and relative dignity of the several members, in which they who are fond of such things have displayed their ingenuity. Among the number: whether the heart gives life and virtue to the blood; or, rather, the blood to the heart. Whether the blood be extant for the sake of the body as matter, nourishment, and instrument; or, on the contrary, the body and its parts are the cause of the blood, and constituted for the sake of the vital principle which especially inheres in it. In like manner, whether the auricles or the ventricles of the heart are the chief, the auricles being the first to live and pulsate, the last to die. Further, whether the left ventricle, which in man is of greater length, and is also surrounded with thicker and more fleshy walls, and is regarded as the source of the spirits, be hotter, more spiritous, excitable, and excellent, than the right, which contains a larger quantity of blood, and is the last to become unstrung by death; in which the blood of the dying accumulates, congeals, and is deprived of life and spirit; to which, moreover, as to a fountain head, the first umbilical veins bring their blood, and from which they themselves derive their origin.

So much appears from careful observation of the order observed in the production of the parts, and certain other points that follow as deductions from these, and do not a little militate against the commonly received physiological doctrines, viz.: since it is manifest that sensation and motion exist before the brain, all sensation and motion do not proceed from the brain; from our history it is clearly ascertained that sense and movement inhere in the very first drop of blood produced in the egg, before there is a vestige of the body. The first scaffolding or rudiment of the body, too, which we have said is merely mucilaginous, before any of the extremities are visible, and when the brain is nothing more than a limpid fluid, if lightly pricked, will move obscurely, will contract and twist itself like a worm or caterpillar, so that it is very evidently possessed of sensation.

There are yet other arguments deduced from sense and motion whence we should infer that the brain was not so much the first principle of the body, in the way the medical writers maintain, as the heart, agreeably to Aristotle’s view.

The motions and actions which physicians style *natural*, because they take place involuntarily, and we can neither prevent nor moderate, accelerate nor retard them by our will, and they therefore do not depend on the brain, still do not occur entirely without causing sensation, but proclaim themselves subject to sense, inasmuch as they are aroused, called forth, and changed thereby. When the heart, for example, is affected with palpitation, tremor, lipothymia, syncope, and with great variety in the extent, rapidity, and order or rhythm of its pulsations, we do not hesitate to ascribe these to morbific causes, implicating and deranging its sensation. For whatever by its divers movements strives against irritations and troubles must necessarily be endowed with sensation.

The stomach and bowels, disturbed by the presence of vitiated humours, are affected with ructus, flatus, vomiting, and diarrhoea; and as it lies not in our power either to provoke or to restrain their motions, neither are we aware of any sensation dependent on the brain which should arouse the parts in question to motions of the kind.

It is truly wonderful to observe the effect of taking a solution of antimony, which we neither distinguish by the taste, nor find any inconvenience from, whether in the swallowing or the rejection. Nevertheless there is a certain discriminating sense in the stomach which distinguishes what is hurtful from what is useful, and by which vomiting is induced.

Nay, the flesh itself readily distinguishes a poisoned wound from one that is not poisoned, and on receipt of the former contracts and condenses itself, whereby phlegmonous tumours are produced, as we find in connexion with the stings of bees, gnats, and spiders.

I have myself, for experiment’s sake, occasionally pricked my hand with a clean needle, and then having rubbed the same needle on the teeth of a spider, I have pricked my hand in another place. I could not by my simple sensation perceive any difference between the two punctures; nevertheless there was a capacity in the skin to distinguish the one from the other; for the part pricked with the envenomed needle immediately contracted into a tubercle, and by and by became red, and hot, and inflamed, as if it collected and girded itself up for a contest with the poison for its overthrow.

The sensations which accompany affections of the uterus, such as twisting, decubitus, prolapse, ascent, suffocation, &c., and other inconveniences and irritations, do not depend on the brain or on common sensation; yet neither are these to be presumed as happening without all consciousness. For that which is wholly without sense is not seen to be irritated by any means, neither can it be stimulated to motion or action of any kind. Nor have we any other means of distinguishing between an animate and sentient thing and one that is dead and senseless than the motion excited by some other irritating cause or thing, which as it incessantly follows, so does it also argue sensation.

But we shall have an opportunity of speaking further of this matter when we discuss the actions and uses of the brain. Respect for our predecessors and for antiquity at large inclines us to defend their conclusions to the extent that love of truth will allow. Nor do I think it becoming in us to neglect and make little of their labours and conclusions who bore the torch that has lighted us to the shrine of philosophy. I am, therefore, of opinion that we should conclude in this way: we have consciousness in ourselves of five principal senses, by which we judge of external objects; but we do not feel with the same sense by means of which we are conscious that we feel—seeing with our eyes, we still do not know by them that we see, but by another sense or sensitive organ, namely, the internal common sensation or *common sensorium*, by which we examine those things that reach us through each of the external sensoria, and distinguish that which is white from that which is sweet or hard. Now this *sensorium commune* to which the species or impressions of all the external instruments of sensation are referred, is obviously the brain, which along with its nerves and the external organs annexed, is held and esteemed to be the adequate instrument of sensation. And this brain is like a sensitive root to which a variety of fibres tend, one of which sees, another hears, a third touches, and a fourth and a fifth smell and taste.

But as there are some actions and motions the government or direction of which is not dependent on the brain, and which are therefore called *natural*, so also is it to be concluded that there is a certain sense or form of touch which is not referred to the common sensorium, nor in any way communicated to the brain, so that we do not perceive by this sense that we feel; but, as happens to those who are deranged in mind, or who are agitated to such a degree by violent passion that they feel no pain, and pay no regard to the impressions made on their senses, so must we believe it to be with this sense, which we therefore distinguish from the proper animal sense. Now such a sense do we observe in zoophytes or plant-animals, in sponges, the sensitive plant, &c.

Wherefore, as many animals are endowed with both sense and motion without having a common sensorium or brain, such as earthworms, caterpillars of various kinds, chrysalides, &c., so also do certain *natural* actions take place in the embryo and even in ourselves without the agency of the brain, and a certain sensation takes place without consciousness. And as medical writers teach that the *natural* differ from the animal actions, so by parity of reason does the *natural* sense of touch differ from the animal sense of touch—it constitutes, in a word, another species of touch; and whilst the one is communicated to the common sensorium, the other is not so communicated.

Further, it is one thing for a muscle to be contracted and moved, and another for it by regulated contractions and relaxations to perform any movement, such as progression or prehension. The muscles or organs of motion, when affected with spasms or convulsions from an irritating cause, are assuredly moved no otherwise than the decapitated cock or hen, which is agitated with many convulsive movements of its legs and wings, but all confused and without a purpose, because the controlling power of the brain has been taken away—common sensation has disappeared, under the controlling influence of which these motions were formerly coordinated to progression by walking or to flight.

We therefore conceive the fact to be that all

[^1]: *On the Generation of Animals*, ii. 4.
[^2]: Fabricius, *op. cit.*, p. 46.
[^3]: *History of Animals*, v. 28.
[^4]: *Metaphysics*, vii. 9.

the natural motions proceed from the power of the heart, and depend on it; the spontaneous motions, however, and those that complete any motion which physicians entitle an animal motion, cannot be performed without the controlling influence of the brain and common sensation. For inasmuch as by this common sensation we are conscious of our perceptions, so also are we conscious that we move, and this whether the motion be regular or otherwise.

We have an excellent example of both of these kinds of motion in respiration. For the lungs, like the heart, are continually carried upwards and downwards by a natural movement, and are excited by any irritation to coughing and more frequent action; but they cannot form and regulate the voice, nor can singing be executed, without the assistance, and in some sort the command, of the *sensorium commune*.

But these matters will be more fully handled when we come to speak of the actions and uses of the brain, and to consider the vital principle or soul. So much we have thought fit to say by the way, that we might show the respect in which we hold our illustrious teachers, and our anxiety to carry them along with us in our labours.

## EXERCISE 58. Of the nutrition of the chick *in ovo*

That the authority of the ancients is not to be rashly thrown off appears in this: it was formerly current doctrine, though many at the present-day, Fabricius^1 among the number, reject it as a delusion and a foolish idea, that the embryo sucked in its mother’s womb. This idea nevertheless had Democritus, Epicurus, and Hippocrates for its supporters; and the father of physic contends for it on two principal grounds: “Unless the foetus sucked,’’ he says,^2 “how should excrements be formed? or how should it know how to suck immediately after it is born?’’

Now, whilst in other instances it is customary to swear by the bare statement of this ancient and most distinguished writer, his *ipse dixit* (αὐτὸς ἔφη) sufficing, because he here makes an assertion contrary to the commonly received opinion, Fabricius not only denies the statement, but spurns the arguments in support of his conclusion. We, however, leave it to the judgment of skilful anatomists and learned physicians to say whether our observations on the generation of animals do not proclaim this opinion of Hippocrates to be not merely probable, but even necessary.

All admit that the foetus *in utero* swims in the midst of an abundance of a watery fluid, which in our history of the egg we have spoken of as the colliquament, this fluid modern authorities regard as the sweat and excrement of the foetus, and ascribe as its principal use the protection of the uterus against injury from the foetus during any violent motion of the mother in running or leaping; and, on the other hand, the defence of the foetus from injury through contact with neighbouring bones, or an external cause, particularly during the period when its limbs are still delicate and weak.

Fabricius ascribes additional uses to this fluid, viz.,
> “that it may moisten and lubricate all the parts around, and dispose the neck of the uterus to facile and speedy dilatation to the utmost extent; and all this is not less assisted by that thick, white, excrementitious matter of the third digestion, neglected by the ancients, which is unctuous and oily, and further prevents the sweat, which may occasionally be secreted sharp and salt in quality, from excoriating the tender body of the foetus.”^3

I readily acknowledge all the uses indicated, viz., that the tender foetus may be secure against all sudden and violent movements of the mother, that he may ride safe in the “bat’s wings,’’ as they are called, and, surrounded with an abundance of water, that he may escape coming into contact with his mother’s sides, being restrained by the retinacular fluid on either hand: this circumambient fluid must certainly protect the body which floats in its middle from all external injury. But, as in many other instances, my observations compel me here to be of a different opinion from Fabricius. In the first place, I am by no means satisfied that this fluid is the sweat of the foetus. And then I do not believe that the fluid serves those important purposes in parturition which he indicates; and much less that it is ever so sharp and saline that an unctuous covering was requisite to protect the foetus from its erosive effects, particularly in those cases where there is already a thick covering of wool, or hair, or feathers. The fluid, in fact, has a pleasant taste, like that of watery milk, so that almost all viviparous animals lap it up, and cleanse their new-born progeny by licking them with their tongues, greedily swallowing the fluid, though none of them was ever seen to touch any of the excrements of their young.

Fabricius spoke of this fluid as saline and acrimonious, because he believed it to be sweat. But what inconvenience, I beseech you, were sweat to the chick, already covered with its feathers? — if indeed anyone ever saw a chicken sweat. Nor do I think he could have said that the use of this fluid in the egg was, by its moistening and lubrifying qualities, to facilitate the birth of the chick; for the drier and older the shell of the egg, the more friable and fragile it becomes. Finally, were it the sweat of the embryo, or foetus, it ought to be most abundant nearest the period of parturition: the larger the foetus and the more food it consumes, the more sweat must it necessarily secrete. But shortly before the exclusion of the chick from the egg, namely, about the nineteenth or twentieth day, there is none of the fluid to be seen, because as the chick grows it is gradually taken up; so that if the thing be rightly viewed, the fluid in question ought rather to be regarded as nutriment than as excrement, particularly as he has said that the chick in the egg breathes, and lets its chirping be heard, which it certainly would not do were it surrounded with water.

But all experienced obstetricians know that the watery fluid of the secundines is of no great use either in lubricating the parts or in facilitating the progress of parturition in the way Fabricius would have it. For the parts surrounding the vulva are relaxed of themselves, and by a kind of proper maturity at the full time, without any assistance from the uterine waters; and particularly those that offer the greatest obstacles to the advance of the foetus, namely, the *ossa pubis* and the *os coccygis*, to which the attention of the midwife is especially directed in assisting the woman in labour. For midwives are much less studious to anoint the soft parts with any emollient salves, lest they tear, than careful to pull the *os coccygis* outwards, a business in which, if the fingers do not suffice, they have recourse to the uterine speculum, applied by the hand of the experienced surgeon, an instrument having three sides or branches, one of which bearing on the *os coccygis*, the other two on the *ossa pubis*, the business of distension is effected by force. For the head of the child that is about to be born, when it makes the turn, and is forced downwards, relaxes and opens the *os uteri*; but coming down he will stick fast, and scarcely be brought forth if he chance to abut upon the point of the *os coccygis*, and immediately the case is one not without danger both to the child and mother. But nature’s intention was obviously to relax and soften all the parts concerned; and the attendant knows that when the uterine orifice is discovered in a soft and lax condition, by the finger introduced, it is an infallible sign that the delivery is at hand even though the waters have not broken. Indeed — and I do not speak without experience — if anything remains in the uterus for expulsion, either after delivery or at any other time, and the uterus makes efforts to get rid of it, the orifice both descends lower and is found soft and relaxed. If the uterine orifice recedes, and is found somewhat hard after delivery, it is a sign of the woman’s restoration to health.

Taught by like experience, I assert that the *ossa pubis* frequently become loosened during labour, their cartilaginous connexion being softened, and the whole hypogastric region enlarged in the most miraculous manner, not, however, by any pouring out of watery fluids, but spontaneously, as ripe fruit gapes that the included seed may find an exit. The degree in which the coccyx may impede delivery, however, is apparent among quadrupeds having tails, which can neither bring forth, nor even discharge the excrement from their bowels, unless the tail be raised; if you but depress the tail with your hand, you prevent the exit of the dung.

Moreover, the most natural labour of all is held to be that in which the foetus and afterbirth, the waters inclusive, or the *ovum*, is expelled entire. Now if the membranes have not given way, and the waters have not escaped, it comes to pass that the surrounding parts are more than usually distended and dilated by the labour pains, in consequence, to wit, of the entire and tense state of the membranes, by which it happens that the foetus is produced more speedily, and with a less amount of effort, although with more suffering to the mother. In cases of this kind we have known women who were suffering much in their travail in consequence of the too great distension, immensely relieved by the rupture of the membranes and the sudden escape of the waters, the laceration being effected either with the nails of the midwife or the use of a pair of forceps.

Experienced midwives are further aware that if the waters come away before the orifice of the uterus is duly dilated, the woman is apt to have a lingering time and a more difficult delivery, contrary to Fabricius’s notion of the waters having such paramount influence in softening and lubricating the parts.

Moreover, that the fluid which we have called colliquament is not the sweat of the foetus is made obvious, both from the history of the egg and of the uterogestation of other animals: it is present before the foetus is formed in any way, before there is a trace of it to be seen; and whilst it is still extremely small and entirely gelatinous, the quantity of water present is very great, so that it seems plainly impossible that so small a body should produce such a mass of excrementitious fluid.

It happens besides that the ramifications of the umbilical veins are distributed over and terminate upon the membrane which incloses this fluid, precisely as on the membranes of the albumen and yelk of the egg, a circumstance from which, and the thing being viewed as it is in fact, it appears to be clearly proclaimed that this fluid is rather to be regarded as food than as excrement.

To me, therefore, the opinion of Hippocrates appears more probable than that of Fabricius and other anatomists, who look on this liquid as sweat, and believe that it must prove detrimental to the foetus. I am disposed, I say, to believe that the fluid with which the foetus is surrounded may serve it for nourishment; that the thinner and purer portions of it, taken up by the umbilical veins, may serve for the constitution and increase of the first formed parts of the embryo; and that from the remainder or the milk, taken into the mouth by suction, passed on to the stomach by the act of deglutition, and there digested or chylified, and finally absorbed by the mesenteric veins, the new being continues to grow and be nourished. I am the more disposed to take this view from certain not impertinent arguments, which I shall proceed to state.

As soon as the embryo acquires a certain degree of perfection it moves its extremities, and begins to prove the actions of the organs destined to locomotion. Now I have seen the chick *in ovo*, surrounded with liquid, opening its mouth, and any fluid that thus gained access to the fauces must needs have been swallowed; for it is certain that whatever passes the root of the tongue and gains the top of the oesophagus, cannot be rejected by any animal with a less effort than that of vomiting. This fact is acted upon every day by veterinary practitioners, who in administering medicated drinks and pills or boluses to cattle, seize the tongue, and having put the article upon its root beyond the protuberant part, the animal cannot do otherwise than swallow it. And if we make the experiment ourselves, we find that a pill carried between the finger and thumb as far as the root of the tongue and there dropped, immediately the action of deglutition is excited, and unless vomiting be produced the pill is taken down. If the embryo swimming in the fluid in question, then, do but open his mouth, it is absolutely necessary that the fluid must reach the fauces; and if the creature then move other muscles, wherefore should we not believe that he also uses his throat in its appropriate office and swallows the fluid?

It is further quite certain that in the crop of the chick — and the same thing occurs in reference to the stomach of other embryos — there is a certain matter having a colour, taste, and consistence, very similar to that of the liquid mentioned, and some of it in the stomach digested to a certain extent, like coagulated milk; and further, whilst we discover a kind of chyle in the upper intestines, we find the lower bowels full of stercoraceous excrements. In like manner we perceive the large intestines of the foetuses of viviparous animals to contain excrements of the same description as those that distend them when they feed on milk. In the sheep and other bisulcated animals we even find *scybala*.

Towards the seventeenth day we find dung very obviously near the anus of the chick; and shortly before the extrusion I have seen the same matter expelled and contained within the membranes. Volcher Coiter, a careful and experienced dissector, states that he has observed the same thing.

Wherefore should we doubt, then, that the foetus *in utero* sucks, and that *chylopoiesis* goes on in its stomach, when we find present both the principles and the recrementitious products of digestion?

And then, when we find the bladder both of the bile and the urine full of those excrements of the second digestion, wherefore should we not conclude that the first digestion, or *chylopoiesis*, has preceded?

The embryo, therefore, seeks for and sucks in nourishment by the mouth; and you will readily believe that he does so if you rip him from his mother’s womb and instantly put a finger in his mouth; which Hippocrates thinks he would not seize had he not previously sucked whilst in the womb. For we are accustomed to see young infants trying various motions, making experiments, as it were, approaching everything, moving their limbs, attempting to walk, and uttering sounds, acts all of which when taught by repeated experience, they afterwards come to execute with readiness and precision. But the foetus so soon as it is born, aye, before it is born, will suck; doubtless as it had done in the uterus long before. For I have found by experience that the child delayed in the birth, and before it has cried or breathed, will seize and suck a finger put into its mouth. A new-born infant, indeed, is more expert at sucking than an adult, or than he is himself if he have but lost the habit for a few days. For the infant does not suck by squeezing the nipple with his lips as we should, and by suction in the common acceptation; he rather seems as if he would swallow the nipple, drawing it wholly into his throat, and with the aid of his tongue and palate, and chewing, as it were, he milks his mother with more art and dexterity than an adult could practise. He therefore appears to have learned that by long custom, and before he saw the light, which we know full well he unlearns by a very brief discontinuance.

These and other observations of the same kind make it extremely probable that the chick *in ovo* is nourished in a twofold manner, namely, by the umbilical and by the mesenteric veins. By the former he imbibes a nourishment that is well nigh perfectly prepared, whence the first-formed parts are engendered and augmented; by the latter he receives chyle for the structure and growth of the other remaining parts.

But the reason is perhaps obscure why the same agent should perform the work of nutrition by means of the same matter in a variety of ways, since nature does nothing in vain. We shall therefore endeavour to explain this.

What is taken up by the umbilical veins is the purer and more limpid part; and the rest of the colliquament in which the foetus swims is like crude milk, or milk deprived of its purer portion. The purer part does not require any of that ulterior concoction of which the remainder stands in need; and to undergo which it is taken into the stomach, where it is transmuted into chyle. Similar to this is the crude and watery milk which is found in the breasts immediately after parturition. The liquefied albumen of the egg, and the crude or watery milk of the *mammae* seem to have in all respects the same colour, taste, and consistence. For the first flow of milk is serous and watery, and women are wont to express water from their breasts before the milk comes white, concocted, and perfect.

Just as the colliquament found in the crop of the chick is a kind of crude milk, whilst the same fluid discovered in the stomach is concocted, white, and curdled; so in viviparous animals, before the milk is concocted in the *mammae*, a kind of dew and colliquament makes its appearance there, and the colliquament only puts on the semblance of milk after it has undergone concoction in the stomach. And so it happens, in Aristotle’s opinion, that the first and most essential parts are formed out of the purer and thinner portion of the colliquament, and are increased by the remaining more indifferent portion after it has undergone elaboration by a new digestion in the stomach. In the same way are the other less important parts developed and maintained. Thus has nature, like a fond and indulgent mother, been sedulous rather to provide superfluity, than to suffer any scarcity of things necessary. Or it might be said to be in conformity with reason to suppose that the foetus, now grown more perfect, should also be nourished in a more perfect manner, by the mouth, to wit, and by a more perfect kind of aliment, rendered purer by having undergone the two antecedent digestions and been thereby freed from the two kinds of excrementitious matter. In the beginning and early stages, nourished by the ramifications of the umbilical veins, it leads in some sort the life of a plant; the body is then crude, white, and imperfect; like plants, too, it is motionless and impassive. As soon, however, as it begins by the mouth to partake of the same aliment further elaborated, as if feeling a diviner influence, boasting a higher grade of vegetative existence, the gelatinous mass of the body is changed into flesh, the organs of motion are distinguished, the spirits are perfected, and motion begins; nor is it any longer nourished like a vegetable, by the roots, but, living the life of an animal, it is supported by the mouth.

## EXERCISE 59. Of the uses of the entire egg

Having now gone through the several changes and processes which must take place in the hen’s egg, in order that it may produce a chick, Fabricius proceeds to consider the uses of the egg at large, and of its various parts; nor does he restrict himself to the hen’s egg, but condescends upon eggs in general. Among other things he inquires: wherefore some eggs are heterogeneous and composed of different elements; and others are homogeneous and similar? such as the eggs of insects, and those creatures that are engendered from the whole egg, viz., by *metamorphosis*, and are not engendered from one part of the egg, and nourished by another part.

I have no purpose myself of entering on a general consideration of eggs of all kinds and descriptions; I have not yet given the history of all, but only of the hen’s egg; so that I shall here limit myself to a survey of the uses of the common hen’s egg, keeping in view the end of all its actions, which is nothing less than the production and completion of a new being, as Fabricius has well and truly said.^1

Among the points having reference to the whole egg, Fabricius speaks of the form, dimensions, and number of eggs.
> “The figure of the egg is round,’’ he says,^2 “in order that the mass of the chick may be stowed in the smallest possible space; for the same cause that God made the world round, namely, that it might embrace all things; and it is from this, as Galen conceives, that this figure is always felt to be most agreeable and consonant to nature. Further, as it has no angles exposed to injury from without, it is, therefore, the safest figure, and the one best adapted to effect the exclusion of the chick.”

It had been well after such a preface to have assigned satisfactory causes why hen’s eggs are not spherical, like the eggs of fishes, worms and frogs, but oblong and pointed; to have shown what there is in them which hinders the presumed perfection of figure. Now to me the form of the egg has never appeared to have aught to do with the engenderment of the chick, but to be a mere accident; and to this conclusion I come the rather when I see such diversities in the shape of the eggs of different hens. They vary, in short, in conformity with the variety that obtains among the uteri of different fowls, in which, as in moulds, they receive their form.

Aristotle,^3 indeed, says that the longer-shaped eggs produce females, the rounder males. I have not made any experiments upon this point myself. But Pliny^4 asserts, in opposition to Aristotle, that the rounder eggs produce females, the others males. Now were there any certainty in such statements, either in one way or the other, some hens would always produce males, others always females, inasmuch as the eggs of the same hen are in many instances always of one figure, namely, either much rounded or acutely pointed. Horace^5 thought that the oblong eggs, as being the more perfect and better concocted, and therefore the better flavoured, produced males.

I willingly pass by the reasons alleged by Fabricius for the form of eggs, as being all irrelevant.

The size of an egg appears to bear a proportion to the size of the foetus produced from it; large hens, too, certainly lay large eggs. The crocodile, however, lays eggs the size of those of the goose; nor does any animal attain to larger dimensions from a smaller beginning. It would seem, too, that the size of the egg and the quantity of matter it contained had some connexion with its fecundity, inasmuch as the very small eggs called *centenines* are all barren.

The number of eggs serves the same end as abundance of conceptions among viviparous animals — they secure the perpetuity of the species. Nature appears to have been particularly careful in providing a numerous offspring to those animals which, by reason of their pusillanimity or bodily weakness, hardly defend themselves against the attacks of others; she has counterbalanced the shortness of their own lives by the number of their progeny.
> “Nature,” says Pliny,^6 “has made the timid tribes among birds more fruitful than the bold ones.”

All generation, as it is instituted by nature for the sake of perpetuating species, so does it occur more frequently among those that are shorter-lived and more obnoxious to external injury lest their race should fail. Birds that are of stronger make, that prey upon other creatures, and therefore live more securely and for longer terms scarcely lay more than two eggs once a year. Pigeons, turtle and ring-doves, that lay but a couple of eggs, make up for the smallness of the number by the frequency of laying, for they will produce young as often as ten times in the course of a year. They, therefore, engender greatly although they do not produce many at a time.

## EXERCISE 60. Of the uses of the yelk and albumen

> “An egg,” says Fabricius,^7 “properly so called, is composed of many parts, because it is the organ of the engenderer, and Galen everywhere insists on the constitution of an organ as implying multiplicity of parts.”

But this view leads us to ask whether every egg must not be heterogeneous, seeing that every egg is organic? And every egg, indeed, even that of the fish and insect, appears to be composed of several different parts—membranes, coverings, defences; nor is the included matter by any means without diversity of constitution in different parts.

Fabricius agrees further, and correctly, with Galen, when he says:
> “Some parts of the egg are the chief instruments of the actions that take place in it, others may be styled necessary — without them no actions could take place; others exist that the action which takes place may be better performed; others, in fine, are destined for the safety and preservation of all of these.”^8

But he is mistaken when he says:
> “If we speak of the prime action, which is the generation of the chick, the chief cause of this is the *semen* and the *chalazae*, these two being the prime cause of the generation of the chick, the *semen* being the efficient cause, the *chalaza* the matter only.”

Now according to the opinion of Aristotle, it must be allowed that that which generates is included in the egg; but Fabricius denies that the *semen* of the cock is contained in the egg.

Nor does he wander less wide of the mark when he speaks of the *chalazae* as the matter from which, by the influence of the *semen galli*, the chick is incorporated. For the chick is not produced either from one or the other, nor yet from both of the *chalazae*, as we have shown in our history. Neither is the generation of the chick effected by *metamorphosis*, nor by any new form assumed and division effected in the *chalazae*, but by *epigenesis*, in the manner already explained. Nor are the *chalazae* especially fecundated by the *semen* of the male bird, but the *cicatricula* rather, or the part which we have called the eye of the egg, from which, when it enlarges, the colliquament is produced, in and from which, subsequently, the blood, the veins, and the pulsating vesicles proceed, after which the whole body is gradually formed. Moreover, on his own admission, the *semen* of the cock never enters the uterus of the hen, and yet it fecundates not only the eggs that are already formed, but others that are yet to be produced.

Fabricius refers the albumen and vitellus to the second action of the egg, which is the nutrition and growth of the chick. “The vitellus and albumen,” he says,^ “are in quantity commensurate with the perfect performance of this action, and with the due development and growth of the chick. The shell and membranes are, therefore, the safety of the whole of the egg as well as the security of its action. But the veins and arteries which carry nourishment are organs without which the action of the egg, in other words, the growth and nutrition of the chick, would not take place.” It is uncertain, however, whether the umbilical vessels of the embryo or the veins and arteries of the mother, whence the egg is increased, are here to be understood. For a like reason the uterus and incubation ought to be referred to this last class of actions.
^ *Ibid.*, p. 48.
^ *Ibid.*, p. 48.

We have to do, then, with the two fluids of the egg, the albumen and the vitellus; for these, before all the other parts, are formed for the use of the embryo, and in them is the second action of the egg especially conspicuous.

The egg of the common hen is of two colours internally, and consists of two fluids, severally distinct, separated by membranes, and in all probability of different natures, and therefore having different ends to serve, inasmuch as they are distinguished by different extensions of the umbilical veins, one of them proceeding to the white, another to the yelk. “The yelk and white of the egg are of opposite natures,” says Aristotle,^ “not only in colour, but also in power. For the yelk is congealed by cold; the white is not congealed, but is rather liquefied; on the contrary, the white is coagulated by heat, the yelk is not coagulated, but remains soft, unless it be overdone, and is more condensed and dried by boiling than by roasting.” The vitellus getting heated during incubation, is rendered more moist; for it becomes like melted wax or tallow, whereby it also takes up more room. For as the embryo grows, the albumen is gradually taken up and becomes inspissated; but the yelk, even when the foetus has attained perfection, appears scarcely to have diminished in size; it is only more diffluent and moist, even when the foetus begins to have its abdomen closed in.
^ *History of Animals*, vii. 2.

Aristotle gives the following reason for the diversity: “Since the bird cannot perfect her offspring within herself, she produces it along with the aliment needful to its growth in the egg. Viviparous animals again prepare the food (milk) in another part of their body, namely, the breasts. Now nature has done the same thing in the egg; but otherwise than as is generally presumed, and as Alcmaeon Crotoniates states it, for it is not the albumen but the vitellus which is the milk of the egg.”^
^ *On the Generation of Animals*, III. 2.

For as the foetus of a viviparous animal draws its nourishment from the uterus whilst it is connected with its mother, like a plant by its roots from the earth; but after birth, and when it has escaped from the womb, sucks milk from the breast, and thereby continues to wax in size and strength, the chick finds the analogue of both kinds of food in the egg. So that whilst in viviparous animals the uterus exists within the parent, in oviparous the parent may rather be said to exist within the uterus (the egg). For the egg is a kind of exposed and detached uterus, and in it are included in some sort vicarious *mammae*. The chick in the egg, I say, is first nourished by albumen, but afterwards, when this is consumed, by the yelk or by milk. The umbilical vascular connexion with the albumen, therefore, when this fluid is used up, withers and is interrupted when the abdomen comes to be closed, and before the period of exclusion arrives, so that it leaves no trace of its existence behind it: in viviparous animals, on the contrary, the umbilical cord is permanent in all its parts up to the moment of birth. The other canal that extends to the vitellus, however, is taken up along with this matter into the abdomen, where being stored, it serves for the support of the delicate foetus until its beak has acquired firmness enough to seize and bruise its food, and its stomach strength sufficient to comminute and digest it; just as the young of the viviparous animal lives upon milk from the *mammae* of its mother, until it is provided with teeth by which it can masticate harder food. For the vitellus is as milk to the chick, as has been already said; and the bird’s egg, as it stands in lieu both of uterus and *mammae*, is furnished with two fluids of different colours, the white and the yelk.

All admit this distinction of fluids. But I, as I have already said, distinguish two albumens in the egg, kept separate by an interposed membrane, the more external of which embraces the other within it, in the same way as the yelk is surrounded by the albumen in general. I have also insisted on the diverse nature of these albumens; distinguished both by situation and their surrounding membranes, they seem in like manner calculated for different uses. Both, however, are there for ends of nutrition, the outermost, as that to which the branches of the umbilical veins are earliest distributed, being first consumed, and then the inner and thicker portion; last of all the vitellus is attacked, and by it is the chick nourished, not only till it escapes from the shell but for some time afterwards.

But upon this point we shall have more to say below, when we come to speak of the manner in which the foetuses of viviparous animals are developed, and at the same time demonstrate that these all derive their origin from eggs, and live by a twofold albuminous food in the womb. One of these is thinner, and contained within the *ovum* or conception; the other is obtained by the umbilical vessels from the placenta and uterine cotyledons. The fluid of the *ovum* resembles a dilute albumen in colour and consistence; it is a sluggish, pellucid liquid, in all respects similar to that which we have called the *colliquament* of the egg, in which the embryo swims, and on which it feeds by the mouth. The fluid which the foetus obtains from the uterine placenta by the aid of the umbilical vessels is more dense and mucaginous, like the inspissated albumen. Whence it clearly appears that the foetus *in utero* is no more nourished by its parent’s blood than is the suckling afterwards, or the chick *in ovo*; but that it is nourished by an albuminous matter concocted in the placenta, and not unlike white of egg.

Nor is the contemplation of the Divine Providence less useful than delightful when we see Nature, in her work of evolving the foetus, furnishing it with sustenance adapted to its varying ages and powers, now more easy, by and by more difficult of digestion. For as the foetus acquires greater powers of digesting, so is it supplied with food that is successively thicker and harder. And the same thing may be observed in the milk of animals generally: when the young creature first sees the light the milk is thinner and more easy of concoction; but in the course of time, and with increased strength in the suckling, it becomes thicker, and is more abundantly stored with caseous matter. Those flabby and delicate women, therefore, who do not nurse their own children, but give them up to the breast of another, consult their health indifferently; for mercenary nurses being for the major part of more robust and hardy frames, and their milk consequently thicker, more caseous, and difficult of digestion, it frequently happens that milk of this kind given to the infants of such parents, particularly during the time of teething, is not well borne, but gives rise to crudities and diarrhoeas, to griping, vomiting, fever, epilepsy, and other formidable diseases of the like nature.

What Fabricius says,^ and strives to bolster up by certain reasonings, of the *chalazae* standing for the matter of the chick, we have already thrown out in our history, and at the same time have made it manifest that the substance of the chick and its first rudiments were produced whilst the *chalazae* were still entire and unchanged, and in a totally different situation.
^ *Op. cit.*, p. 34.

Neither is it true, as he states, “that the *chalazae*, rendered fruitful by the *semen* of the cock, stand in the place of seed, and that from them the chick is produced.”^ Nor are the *chalazae*, as he will have it, “in colour, substance, and bodily properties so like seed, or bear so strong a resemblance to the embryo in a boiled egg, that we may rightly conceive all the parts designated spermatic to be thence engendered.”^ I am rather of opinion that the fluid which we have called *colliquament*, or the thinner portion of the albumen liquefied and concocted, is to be regarded as of the nature of seed, and, if the testimony of our eyes is to be credited, as a substitute for it.
^ *Op. cit.*, p. 54.
^ *Ibid.*, p. 57.

The observation of this venerable old man is therefore unnecessary when he says, “As the whole animal body is made up of two substances very different from one another, and even of opposite natures, viz., hot and cold— among the hot parts being included all those that are full of blood and of a red colour; among the cold all those that are exsanguine and white — these two orders of parts doubtless require a different and yet a like nourishment, if it be true that we are nourished by the same things of which we are made. The spermatic, white, and cold parts, therefore, require white and cold nourishment; the sanguineous, red, and hot parts, again, demand nourishment that is red and hot. And so is the cold white of the egg properly held to nourish the cold and white parts of the chick, and the hot and sanguine yelk regarded as a substitute for the hot and purple blood. In this way do all the animal parts obtain nourishment suitable and convenient for them.”^ Now we by no means admit that the two fluids or matters of the egg are there as appropriate means of nourishment for different orders of parts. For we have already said that the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, muscles, bones, ligaments, &c., &c., were all alike and indiscriminately white and bloodless on their first formation.

Further, on the preceding view of Fabricius it would follow that the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, &c., were not spermatic parts, did not originate from the seed (which he, however, will by no means allow), inasmuch as they too are by and by nourished by the blood and grow out of it; for every part is both formed and nourished by the same means, and nutrition is nothing more than the substitution of a like matter in the room of that which is lost.

Nor would he find less difficulty in answering the question: how it happens that when the albumen in the egg is all consumed, the cold and white parts, such as the bones, ligaments, brain, spinal marrow, &c., continue to be nourished and to grow by means of the vitellus? which to these must be nourishment as inappropriate as albumen to the hot, red, and sanguine parts.

Adopting the views commented on, indeed, we should be compelled to admit that the hot and sanguineous parts were the last to be produced: the flesh after the bones; the liver, spleen, and lungs after the ligaments and intestinal canal; and further, that the cold parts of the chick must come together and attain maturity, the white being all the while consumed, and the hot parts be engendered subsequently, when the vitellus fails and ceases from nourishing them; and then it would be certain that all the parts could not take their rise in and be constituted out of the same clear liquid. All such conclusions, however, are refuted by simple ocular inspection.

I add another argument to those already supplied: the eggs of cartilaginous fishes — skates, the dog-fish, &c. — are of two colours; their yelks are of a good deep colour; nevertheless, all the parts of these fishes are white, bloodless, and cold, not even excepting the substance of their liver. On the contrary, I have seen a certain breed of fowls of large size, their feathers black, their flesh well supplied with blood, their liver red; yet were the yelks of the eggs of these fowls — fruitful eggs — of the palest shade of yellow, not deeper than the tint of ripe barley straw.

Fabricius, however, seems in these words to retract all he has but just said: “There is one thing to be particularly wondered at both in the yelk and the white, viz., that neither of them being blood, they are still so near to the nature of blood that they in fact differ but very slightly from it — there is but little wanting to constitute either of them blood; so that little labour and a very slight concoction suffice to effect the change. The veins and arteries distributed to the membranes of both the white and yelk are consequently seen replete with blood at all times; the white and yelk nevertheless continuing possessed of their own proper nature, though either, so soon as it is imbibed by the vessels, is changed into blood, so closely do they approach in constitution to this fluid.”^
^ *Op. cit.*, p. 55.

But if it be matter of certainty that blood exists no less in the vessels distributed to the albumen than in those sent to the vitellus, and that both of these fluids are so closely allied to blood in their nature, and turn into blood so readily; who, I beseech you, will doubt that the blood, and all the parts which are styled sanguineous, are nourished and increased through the albumen as well as the vitellus?

Our author, however, soon contrives a subterfuge from this conclusion: “Although all this be true,” he says,^ “still must we conceive that the matter which is imbibed by the veins from the yelk and white is only blood in the same sense as the chyle in the mesenteric veins, in which nothing but blood is ever seen; now chyle is but the shadow of blood, and is first perfected in the liver; and in like manner the matter taken up by the veins from the white and yellow is only the shadow of blood,” &c. Be it so; but hiding under this shadow, he does not answer the question, wherefore the blood and blood-like parts should not, for the reasons cited, be equally well nourished by the albumen as by the vitellus?
^ *Ibid.*, p. 55.

Had our author, in like manner, asserted that the hotter parts are rather nourished by that blood which is derived from the vitellus than by that attracted from the albumen, and the colder parts, on the other hand, by that which is derived from the albumen, I should not myself have been much disposed to gainsay him.

There is one consideration in the whole question, however, which is sorely against him; it is this — how is the blood formed in the egg? by what agent is either white or yelk turned into blood whilst the liver is not yet in existence? For in the egg, at all events, he could not say that the blood was transfused from the mother. He says, indeed, “This blood is produced and concocted in the veins rather than in the liver; but it becomes bone, cartilage, flesh, &c. in the parts themselves, where it undergoes exact concoction and assimilation.” In this he adds nothing; he neither tells us how or by what means perfect blood is concocted and elaborated in the minute veins both of the albumen and vitellus, the liver, as I have said, not having yet come into existence — not a particle of any part of the body, in fact, having yet been produced by which either concoction or elaboration might be effected. And then, forgetful of what he has previously said, viz., that the hot and haematous parts are nourished by the vitellus and the cold and anaemic parts by the albumen, he is plainly in contradiction with himself when he admits that the same blood is turned into bone, cartilage, flesh, and all other parts.

More than this, Fabricius has slipped the greatest difficulty of all, the source of not a little doubt and debate to the medical mind, viz., how the liver should be the source and artificer of the blood, seeing that this fluid not only exists in the egg before any *viscus* is formed, but that all medical writers teach that the *parenchymata* of the viscera are but effusions of blood? Is the work the author of its workman? If the *parenchyma* of the liver come from the blood, how can it be the cause of the blood?

What follows is of the same likelihood: “There is another reason wherefore the albumen should be separated from the yelk, namely, that the foetus may swim in it, and be thus supported, lest tending downwards by its own weight, it should incline to one particular part, and dragging, should break the vessels, in preventing which the viscidity and purity of the albumen contribute effectually. For did the foetus grow amid the yelk, it might readily sink to the bottom, and so cause laceration of that body.” Sufficiently *jejune*! For what, I entreat, can the purity of the albumen contribute to the support of the embryo? Or how should the thinner albumen sustain it better than the thicker and more earthy yelk? Or where the danger, I ask, of its sinking down, when we see that the egg in incubation is always laid on its side, and there is nothing to fear either for the ascent or the descent of the embryo? It is indubitable, indeed, that not only does the embryo of the chick float in the egg, but that the embryo of every animal during its formation floats in the uterus; this however takes place amidst the fluid which we have called *colliquament*, and neither in the albumen nor vitellus, and we have elsewhere given the reason wherefore this is so.

“Aristotle informs us,” says Fabricius, “that the vitellus rises to the blunt end of the egg when the chick is conceived; and this because the animal is incorporated from the *chalaza*, which adheres to the vitellus; whence the vitellus which was in the middle is drawn towards the upper wider part of the egg, that the chick may be produced where the natural cavity exists, which is so indispensable to its well-being.” The *chalaza*, however, is certainly connected still more intimately with the albumen than with the yelk.

My mode of interpreting the ascent in question is this: the spot or *cicatricula* conspicuous on the *membrana vitelli*, expands under the influence of the spirituous *colliquament* engendered within it, and requiring a larger space, it tends towards the blunt end of the egg. The liquefied portion of the vitellus and albumen, diluted in like manner, and concocted and made more spirituous, swims above the remaining crude parts, just as the inferior particles of water in a vessel, when heated, rise from the bottom to the top, a fact which every medical man must have observed when he had chanced to put a measure of thick and turbid urine into a bath of boiling water, in which case the upper part first becomes clear and transparent. Another example will make this matter still more plain. There is an instrument familiar to almost everybody, made rather for amusement than any useful purpose, nearly full of water, on the surface of which float a number of hollow glass beads which by their lightness and swimming together support a variety of figures, Cupids with bows and quivers, chariots of the sun, centaurs armed, and the like, which would else all sink to the bottom. So also does the eye of the egg, as I have called it, or first *colliquament*, dilated by the heat of the incubating fowl and genital virtue inherent in the egg, expand, and thereby rendered lighter, rise to the top, when the vitellus, with which it is connected follows. It is because the *cicatricula*, formerly situated on the side of the vitellus, now tends to rise directly upwards that the thicker albumen is made to give place, and the *chalazae* are carried to the sides of the egg.

### EXERCISE 61. Of the uses of the other parts of the egg

The shell is hard and thick that it may serve as a defence against external injury to the fluids and the chick it includes. It is brittle, nevertheless, particularly towards the blunt end, and as the time of the chick’s exclusion draws near, doubtless that the birth may suffer no delay. The shell is porous also; for when an egg, particularly a very recent one, is dressed before the fire, it sweats through its pores. Now these pores are useful for ventilation; they permit the heat of the incubating hen to penetrate more readily, and the chick to have supplies of fresh air; for that it both breathes and chirps in the egg before its exclusion is most certain.

The membranes serve to include the fluids, and therefore are they present in the same number as these, and therefore is the *colliquament* also invested, as soon as it is produced, with a *tunica propria*, which Aristotle refers to in these words: “A membrane covered with ramifications of blood-vessels already surrounds the clear liquid,”^ &c. But the exit of the chick being at hand, and the albumen and *colliquament* being entirely consumed, all the membranes, except that which surrounds the vitellus, are dried up and disappear; the *membrana vitelli*, on the contrary, along with the yelk, is retracted into the peritoneum of the chick and included in the abdomen. Of the membranes two are common to the whole egg, which they surround immediately under the shell; the rest belong, one to the albumen, one to the yelk, one to the *colliquament*; but all still conduce to the preservation and separation of the parts they surround. The outer of the two common membranes which adheres to the shell is the firmer, that it may take no injury from the shell; the inner one again is smooth and soft, that it may not hurt the fluids; in the same way, therefore, as the meninges of the brain protect it from the roughness of the superincumbent skull. The internal membranes, as I have said, include and keep separate their peculiar fluids, whence they are extremely thin, pellucid, and easily torn.
^ *History of Animals*, vi. 3.

Fabricius ascribes great eminence and dignity to the *chalazae*, regarding them as the parts whence the chick is formed; he, however, leaves the spot or *cicatricula* connected with the *membrana vitelli* without any office whatsoever, looking on it merely as the remains of the *peduncle* whence the vitellus was detached from the *vitellarium* in the superior uterus of the hen. In his view the vitellus formerly obtained its nourishment either by this *peduncle* or the vessels passing through it; but when detached, and no longer nourished by the hen, a simple trace of the former connexion and important function alone remains.

I, however, am of opinion that the uses of the *chalazae* are no other than those I have assigned them, namely, that they serve as poles to the *microcosm* of the egg, and are the association of all the membranes convoluted and twisted together, by which not only are the several fluids kept in their places, but also in their distinct relative positions. But I have absolute assurance that the spot or *cicatricula* in question is of the very highest importance; it is the part in which the *calor insitus* nestles; where the first spark of the vital principle is kindled; for the sake of which, in a word, the whole of the rest of the fluids and all the membranes of the egg are contrived. But this has been already insisted on above.

Formerly, indeed, I did think with Fabricius that this *cicatricula* was the remains or trace of the detached *peduncle*; but I afterwards learned by more accurate observation that this was not the case; that the *peduncle*, by which the vitellus hangs, was infixed in no such limited space as we find it in apples and plums, and in such a way as would have given rise to a scar on its separation. This *peduncle*, in short, expands like a tube from the ovary on towards the vitellus, the horizon of which it embraces in a bipartite semicircle, not otherwise than the *tunica conjunctiva* embraces the eye; and this in suchwise that the superior part of the vitellus, or the hemisphere which regards the ovary, is almost free from any contact or cohesion with the *peduncle*, in the superior part of the cup or hollow of which nevertheless, but somewhat to the side, the spot or *cicatricula* in question is placed. The *peduncles* becoming detached from the *vitelli* can therefore in no way be said to leave any trace of their attachments behind them. Of the great importance of this spot in generation I have already spoken in the historical portion of my work.

But I have still, always following my old teacher Fabricius as my guide on the way, to treat of the uses of the cavity in the blunt end of the egg.

Fabricius enumerates various conveniences arising from this cavity, according to its dimensions. I shall be brief on the subject: it contains air, and is therefore useful in the ventilation of the egg, assisting the perspiration, refrigeration, and respiration, and finally the chirping of the chick. Whence this cavity, small at first, is larger by and by, and at last becomes of great size, as the several offices mentioned come into play.

Thus far have we spoken of the generation of the egg and chick, and of the uses of the several parts of the egg; and to the type exhibited we have referred the mode of generation of oviparous animals in general. We have still to speak of the generation of viviparous animals, in doing which we shall as before refer all to a single familiarly known species.

### EXERCISE 62. An egg is the common origin of all animals

“Animals,” says Aristotle,^ “have this in common with vegetables, that some of them arise from seed, others arise spontaneously; for as plants either proceed from the seed of other plants, or spring up spontaneously, having met with some primary condition fit for their evolution, some of them deriving their nourishment from the ground, others arising from and living on other plants; so are some animals engendered from cognate forms, and others arise spontaneously, no kind of cognate seed having preceded their birth; and whilst some of them are generated from the earth, or putrefying vegetable matter, like so many insects, others are produced in animals themselves and from the excrementitious matters of their parts.” Now the whole of these, whether they arise spontaneously, or from others, or in others, or from the parts or excrements of these, have this in common, that they are engendered from some principle adequate to this effect, and from an efficient cause inherent in the same principle. In this way, therefore, the *primordium vegetale* or *vegetative incipience*, understanding by this a certain corporeal something having life

in potential or a certain something existing *per se* which is capable of changing into a vegetative form under the agency of an internal principle. Such primordia are the eggs of animals and the seeds of plants; such also are the conceptions of viviparous animals, and the worm, as Aristotle calls it, whence insects proceed: the primordia of different living things consequently differ from one another; and according to their diversities are the modes of generation of animals, which nevertheless all agree in this one respect, that they proceed from the vegetal primordium as from matter endowed with the virtue of an efficient cause, though they differ in respect of the primordium which either bursts forth, as it were, spontaneously and by chance, or shows itself as fruit or seed from something else preceding it. Whence some animals are spoken of as spontaneously produced, others as engendered by parents. And these last are again distinguished by their mode of birth, for some are oviparous, others viviparous, to which Aristotle^ adds a vermiparous class. But if we take the thing as simple sense proclaims it, there are only two kinds of birth, inasmuch as all animals engender others either in *actu*—virtually, or in *potentia*—potentially. Animals which bring forth in fact and virtually are called viviparous, those that bring forth potentially are oviparous. For every primordium that lives potentially, we, with Fabricius, think ought to be called an egg, and we make no distinction between the worm of Aristotle and an egg, both because to the eye there is no difference, and because the identity is in conformity with reason. For the vegetal primordium which lives potentially is also an animal potentially.

^ *History of Animals*, i. 5.

Nor can the distinction which Aristotle made between the egg and the worm be admitted: for he defines an egg to be that
> “from part of which an animal is produced”;^
whilst that, he says elsewhere,
> “which is totally changed, and which does not produce an animal from a part only, is a worm.”^
These bodies, however, agree in this, that they are both inanimate births, and only animals potentially; both, consequently, are eggs.

^ *On the Generation of Animals*, iii. 9.
^ *History of Animals*, i. 5.

And then Aristotle himself, whilst he speaks of worms in one place, designates them by the name of eggs in another.^ Treating of the locust, he says,
> “its eggs become spoiled in autumn when the season is wet”;^
and again, speaking of the grasshopper, he has these words:
> “when the little worm has grown in the earth it becomes a matrix of grasshoppers (*tettigometra*)”;
and immediately afterwards,
> “the females are sweeter after coitus, for then they are full of white eggs.”^

^ *Ibid.*, v. 29.
^ *Ibid.*, v. 30.
^ *Ibid.*, v. 30.

In this very place, indeed, where he distinguishes between an egg and a worm, he adds:
> “but the whole of this tribe of worms, when they have come to their full size, are changed in some sort into eggs; for their shell or covering hardens, and they become motionless for a season, a circumstance that is plainly to be seen in the *vermiculi* of bees and wasps, and also in caterpillars.”^
Everyone indeed may observe that the primordia of spiders, silkworms, and the like, are not less to be accounted eggs than those of the *Crustacea* and *mollusca*, and almost all fishes, which are not actually animals, but are potentially possessed of the faculty of producing them. Since, then, those creatures that produce actually are called viviparous, and those that produce potentially either pass without any general distinguishing title or are called oviparous and particularly as such productions are vegetal primordia, analogous to the seeds of plants, which true eggs must needs be held to be, the conclusion is that all animals are either viviparous or oviparous.

^ *On the Generation of Animals*, iii. 9.

But as there are many species of oviparous animals, so must there also be several species of eggs; for every primordium is not alike fit to receive or assume every variety of animal form indifferently. Though we admit, therefore, that eggs in a general sense do not differ, yet when we find that one is perfect, another imperfect, it is obvious that they differ essentially from one another. Perfect eggs are such as are completed in the uterus, where they obtain their due dimensions before being extruded; of this kind are the eggs of birds. Imperfect eggs, again, are such as are prematurely excluded before they are of the full size, but increase after they are laid; of this description are the eggs of fishes, *Crustacea* and *mollusca*; the primordia of insects, which Aristotle entitles "worms," are further to be referred to this class, as well as the primordia of those animals that arise spontaneously.

Moreover, although perfect eggs are of two colours, in other words, are composed of *albumen* and *vitellus*, some are still only of one hue, and consist of *albumen* alone. In like manner, of imperfect eggs, some from which a perfect animal proceeds are properly so called; such are the eggs of fishes; others are improperly so styled, they engendering an imperfect animal, namely, a worm, grub, or caterpillar, a kind of mean between a perfect and an imperfect egg, which, in respect of the egg or the primordium itself, is an animal endowed with sense and motion, and nourishing itself; but in respect of a fly, moth or butterfly, whose primordium it is potentially, it is as a creeping egg, and to be reputed as adequate to its own growth; of this description is the caterpillar, which having at length completed its growth is changed into a *chrysalis* or perfect egg, and ceasing from motion, it is like an egg, an animal potentially.

In the same way, although there are some eggs from the whole of which a perfect animal is produced by metamorphosis, without being nourished by any remains of the substance of the egg, but forthwith finds food for itself abroad, there are others from one part of which the embryo is produced, and from the remainder of which it is nourished—although, I repeat, there are such differences among eggs, still, if we be permitted to conclude on the grounds of sense and analogy, there is no good reason wherefore those that Aristotle calls worms should not be spoken of as eggs; inasmuch as all vegetal principles are not indeed animals actually, but are so potentially, are true animal seeds, analogous to the seeds of vegetables, as we have already demonstrated in the particular instance of the hen’s egg. All animals are, therefore, either viviparous or oviparous, inasmuch as they all either produce a living animal in fact, or an egg, rudiment, or primordium, which is an animal potentially.

The generation of all oviparous animals may therefore be referred to that of the hen’s egg as a type, or at all events deduced from thence without difficulty, the same things and incidents that have been enumerated in connexion with the common fowl being also encountered in all other oviparous animals whatsoever. The various particulars in which they differ one from another, or in which they agree, either generally, or specifically, or analogically, will be subsequently treated of when we come to speak of the generation of insects and the animals that arise equivocally. For as every generation is a kind of way leading to the attainment of an animal form, as one race of animal is more or less like or unlike another, their constituent parts either agreeing or disagreeing, so does it happen in respect of their mode of generation. For perfect Nature, always harmonious with herself in her works, has instituted similar parts for similar ends and actions: to arrive at the same results, to attain the same forms, she has followed the same path, and has established one and the same method in the business of generation universally.

Wherefore as we still find the same parts in the perfect or two-coloured egg of every bird, so do we also observe the same order and method pursued in the generation and development of their embryos as we have seen in the egg of the common fowl. And so also are the same things to be noted in the eggs of serpents and of reptiles, or oviparous quadrupeds, such as tortoises, frogs, and lizards, from all the perfect two-coloured eggs of which embryos are produced and perfected in the same manner. Nor is the case very different in regard to fishes. But of the manner in which spiders and the *Crustacea*, such as shrimps and crabs, and the *mollusca*, such as the cuttlefish and calamary, arise from their eggs; of the conditions also upon which worms and grubs first proceed from the eggs of insects, which afterwards change into *chrysalides* or *aurelias*, as if they reverted anew to the state of eggs, from which at length emerge flies or butterflies—of the several respects in which these differ in their mode of generation from an egg, from what we have found in the hen’s egg, will be matter for remark in the proper place.

Although all eggs consisting of yolk and white are not produced and fecundated in the same manner, but some are made prolific through the intercourse of male and female, and others in some other way (as of fishes); and although there is some difference even in the mode in which eggs grow, some attaining maturity within the body of the parent, others continuing to be nourished and to grow when extruded, there is still no reason why an embryo should not be developed in the same precise manner in every egg—always understood as perfect—as it is in the egg of the hen. Wherefore the history which has been given of the evolution of the chick from the hen’s egg may be regarded as applicable to the generation of all other oviparous animals whatsoever, as well as to the inferences or conclusions which may be deduced from thence.

## EXERCISE 63. Of the generation of viviparous animals

Thus far have we treated mainly of the generation of oviparous animals; we have still to speak particularly of the other species of generation, the viviparous, to wit, in which many things identical with those we have noticed in oviparous generation will come to be observed. These we have reduced into order, and here at length present for consideration. Even the parts that appear paradoxical and in contradiction with the current views of generation will, I believe, be found entirely in conformity with truth.

Among viviparous animals, man, the most perfect of all creatures, occupies the foremost place; after him come our ordinary domestic animals, of which some are *soliped*, such as the horse and ass; others *bisulcate*, as the ox, goat, sheep, deer, and hog; others *digitate*, such as the dog, cat, rabbit, mouse, and others of the same description; from the modes of whose generation a judgment may be formed of that of all other viviparous animals. Wherefore I shall propose a single genus, by way of general example or type, as we did in the case of the oviparous class; this made familiar to us, will serve as a light or standard, by means of which all the others may be judged of by analogy.

The reasons that led me to select the hen’s egg as the measure of eggs in general have been already given: eggs are of little price, and are everywhere to be obtained, conditions that permit repeated study, and enable us cheaply and readily to test the truth of statements made by others.

We have not the same facilities in studying the generation of viviparous animals: we have rarely, if ever, an opportunity of dissecting the human uterus; and then to enter on the subject experimentally in the horse, ox, sheep, goat, and other cattle, would be attended with immense labour and no small expense; dogs, cats, rabbits, and the like, however, will supply those with subjects who are desirous of putting to the test of experiment the matters that are to be delivered by us in this place.

Fabricius of Aquapendente, as if every conception of a viviparous animal were in a certain sense an egg, begins his treatise with the egg as the universal example of generation; and among other reasons for his conclusions assigns this in particular:
> “Because the study of the egg has the most extensive application, the greater number of animals being engendered from eggs.”^
Now we, at the very outset of our observations, asserted that all animals were in some sort produced from eggs. For even on the same grounds, and in the same manner and order in which a chick is engendered and developed from an egg, is the embryo of viviparous animals engendered from a pre-existing conception. Generation in both is one and identical in kind; the origin of either is from an egg, or at least from something that by analogy is held to be so. An egg is, as already said, a conception exposed beyond the body of the parent, whence the embryo is produced; a conception is an egg remaining within the body of the parent until the foetus has acquired the requisite perfection; in everything else they agree; they are both alike primordially vegetables, potentially they are animals. Wherefore, the same theorems and conclusions, though they may appear paradoxical, which we drew from the history of the egg, turn out to be equally true with regard to the generation of animals generally. For it is an admitted fact that all embryos, even those of man, are procreated from some conception or primordium. Let us, therefore, say that that which is called primordium among things arising spontaneously, and seed among plants, is an egg among oviparous animals, i.e., a certain corporeal substance, from which, through the motions and efficacy of an internal principle, a plant or an animal of one description or another is produced; but the prime conception in viviparous animals is of the same precise nature, a fact which we have found approved both by sense and reason.

^ *De formatione ovi et pulli*, i.

What we have already affirmed of the egg, viz., that it was the *sperma* or seed of animals and analogous to the seeds of plants, we now affirm of the conception, which is indeed the seed of an animal, and therefore also properly called *ovum* or egg. Because
> “a true seed,” according to Aristotle,^ “is that which derives its origin from the intercourse of male and female, and possesses the virtues of both; such as is the seed of all vegetables, and of some animals, in which the sexes are not distinct, and is, as that which is first mingled from male and female, a kind of promiscuous conception or animal; for it has those things already that are recognized of both”;
i.e., matter adapted to nourish the foetus, and a plastic or formative and effective virtue. And so in like manner is a conception the fruit of the intercourse of male and female, and the seed of the future embryo; it therefore does not differ from an egg.

^ *On the Generation of Animals*, i. 18.

> “But that which proceeds from the generant is the cause which first obtains the principle of generation (i.e., it is the efficient cause), and ought to be called the geniture,”^
not the seed, as is commonly done both by the vulgar and philosophers at the present time; because it has not that which is required of both the concurring agents, neither is it analogous to the seeds of plants. But whatever possesses this, and corresponds to the seeds of vegetables, that too is rightly entitled egg and conception.

^ *Ibid.*

Further, the definition of an egg, as given by Aristotle, is perfectly applicable to a conception:
> “An egg,” he says, “is that, the principal part of which goes to constitute an animal, the remainder to nourish the animal so constituted.”^
Now the same thing is common to a conception, as shall be made to appear visibly from the dissection of viviparous animals.

^ *History of Animals*, i. 5.

Moreover, as the chick is excluded from the egg under the influence of warmth derived from the incubating hen or obtained in any other way, even so is the foetus produced from the conception in the uterus under the genial warmth of the mother’s body. In few words, I say, that what oviparous animals supply by their breast and incubation, viviparous animals afford by their uterus and internal embrace. For the rest, in all that respects the development, the embryo is produced from the conception in the same manner and order as the chick from the egg, with this single difference, that whatever is required for the formation and growth of the chick is present in the egg, whilst the conception, after the formation of the embryo, derives from the uterus of the mother whatever more is requisite to its increase, by which it continues to grow in common with the foetus. The egg, on the contrary, becomes more and more empty as the chick increases; the nutriment that was laid up in it is diminished; nor does the chick receive aught in the shape of new aliment from the mother; whilst the foetus of viviparous animals has a continued supply, and when born, moreover, continues to live upon its mother’s milk. The eggs of fishes, however, increase through nourishment obtained from without; and insects and *crustaceous* and *molluscous* animals have eggs that enlarge after their extrusion. Yet are not these called eggs the less on this account, nor, indeed, are they therefore any the less eggs. In like manner the conception is appropriately designated by the name of *ovum* or egg, although it requires and procures from without the variety of aliment that is needful to its growth.

Fabricius gives this reason for some animals being oviparous, for all not producing living offspring:
> “It is,” he says, “that eggs detained in the uterus till they had produced their chicks would interfere with the flight of birds, and weigh them down by their weight.”
Serpents would also be hindered in their alternate zigzag movements by a multitude of eggs in the abdomen. In the body of tortoises, with their hard and girding shell, there is no room for any store or increase of eggs; nor would the abdomen of fishes suffice for the multitude of eggs they must spawn were these to grow to any size. It was, therefore, matter of necessity that those creatures should lay their eggs imperfect. It seems most natural that an animal should retain and cherish its conception in its interior until the foetus it produces has come to maturity; but Nature sees herself compelled, as it were, occasionally to permit the premature birth of various eggs, and to provide them, without the body of the parent, with the nourishment they require for their complete development. As to everything that refers to the evolution of the foetus, all animals are engendered from an oviform primordium; I say oviform, not as meaning that it has the precise configuration of an egg, but the nature and constitution of one; this being common in generation, that the vegetal primordium whence the foetus is produced, including the nature of an egg, corresponding in its proportions to the seed of a plant, pre-exists. In all vegetal primordia, consequently, whether eggs, or having the form of eggs, there are inherent the nature and conditions of an egg, properties which the seeds of plants have in common with the eggs of animals. The primordium of any animal, whatsoever, is therefore called seed and fruit; and in like manner the seed of every plant is spoken of as a kind of conception or egg.

And this is the reason why Aristotle says:
> “Animals that engender internally have something formed in the fashion of an egg after their first conception: there is a fluid contained within a delicate membrane, like an egg without the shell. And this is the cause why the disorders of the conception, which are apt to occur in the early period, are called discharges.”^
Such a discharge is particularly observed among women when they miscarry in the course of the first or second month. I have repeatedly seen such *ova* aborted at this time; and such was the one which Hippocrates has described as having been thrown off by the female pipe-player in consequence of a fall.

^ *On the Generation of Animals*, iii. 9.

In the uterus of all animals there is, consequently, present a prime conception or primordium, which, on Aristotle’s testimony,
> “is like an egg surrounded with a membrane from which the shell had been removed.”^
This fact will appear still more plainly from what is about to be said. Meantime let us conclude with the philosopher,
> “that all living creatures, whether they swim, or walk, or fly, and whether they come into the world with the form of an animal or of an egg, are engendered in the same manner.”

^ *History of Animals*, vii. 7.

## EXERCISE 64. The generation of viviparous animals in general is illustrated from the history of that of the hind and doe, and the reason of this selection

It was customary with his Serene Majesty, King Charles, after he had come to man’s estate, to take the diversion of hunting almost every week, both for the sake of finding relaxation from graver cares, and for his health; the chase was principally the buck and doe, and no prince in the world had greater herds of deer, either wandering in freedom through the wilds and forests, or kept in parks and chases for this purpose. The game during the three summer months was the buck, then fat and in season; and in the autumn and winter, for the same length of time, the doe. This gave me an opportunity of dissecting numbers of these animals almost every day during the whole of the season when they were rutting, taking the male, and falling with young; I had occasion, so often as I desired it, to examine and study all the parts, particularly those dedicated to the offices of generation.

I shall therefore consider the generation of viviparous animals in general, from the particular history of the hind and doe, as the instance most convenient to me; and, as I have done above, in speaking of oviparous generation, where I have referred everything to the common fowl, so shall I here, in discussing viviparous generation, refer all to the fallow deer and roe. In taking this course, I am not moved by the same reasons as I was in reference to the hen’s egg; but because the great prince, whose physician I was, besides taking much pleasure in such inquiries, and not disdaining to bear witness to my discoveries, was pleased in his kindness and munificence to order me an abundant supply of these animals and repeated opportunities of examining their bodies.

I therefore propose to give the history of generation in the hind and doe as I have observed it during a long series of years, and as most familiar to me, believing that from thence something certain in reference to the generation of other viviparous animals may be concluded. In giving a faithful narrative of this history, I shall not abstain in its course from introducing particulars worthy of note that have either been observed accidentally and by the way, or that are the result of particular dissections instituted for the purpose of arriving at conclusions, the subjects of these having been other *bisulcated*, *hoofed*, or *multungulated* animals, or, finally, man himself. We shall give a simple narrative of the series of formations of the foetus, following the footsteps of nature in the process.

## EXERCISE 65. Of the uterus of the hind and doe

About to treat of the generation of the hind and doe, our first business will be to speak of the place where it proceeds, or of the uterus, as we have done above, in giving the history of the common fowl, by which all that follows will be more easily and readily understood. And history has this great pre-eminence over fable, that it narrates the events which transpired in certain places at certain times, and therefore leads us to knowledge by a safe and assured way.

Now that we may have a clearer idea of the uterus of the hind, I shall describe both its external and internal structure, following the uterus of the human female as my guide. For man is the most consummate of creatures, and has therefore the genital as well as all other parts in higher perfection than any other animal. The parts of the female uterus consequently present themselves with great distinctness, and by reason of the industry of anatomists in this direction are believed to be particularly well known to us.

We meet with many things in the uterus of deer which we encounter in the uterus of the human female; and we also observe several that differ. In the *vulva* or *os externum* we find neither *labia*, nor *clitoris*, nor *nymphae*, but only two openings, one for the urine, adjacent to the *pecten*, or *os pubis*, the other the *vagina*, lying between the *meatus urinarius* and the anus. A cuticular or membranous fold, such as we have noted in the hen, stretching downwards from the anus, acts as a *velabrum*, supplies the place of *nymphae* and *labia pudendi*, and guards against injury from without. This *velabrum* must be somewhat retracted by the female when she copulates, or at all events must be raised by the penis of the male as it enters the *vulva*.

The *symphysis pubis* being divided in deer, and the legs widely separated, the urinary bladder, the *vagina* which is entered by the penis of the buck, and the *cervix uteri*, are all seen in their relative situations, not otherwise than they are in women; the *ligamenta suspensoria*, with the veins, arteries, and testicles, as they are called, also come into sight; the *cornua* of the uterus in these creatures are also more remarkable than any other part of this organ.

As for the vessels called *vasa praeparantia* and *vasa deferentia seu ejaculantia*, you will discover nothing of the kind here, nor indeed in any other female animal that I am aware of. The anatomists who believe that women emit a seminal fluid *sub coitu* have been too eager in their search after such vessels; for in some they are not met with at all, and where they do occur they never present themselves with anything of uniformity of character. Wherefore it seems most likely that women do not emit any semen *sub coitu*, which is in conformity as I have said with what the greater number of women state. And although some of warmer temperament shed a fluid in the sexual embrace, still that this is fruitful semen, or is a necessary requisite to conception, I do not believe; for many women conceive without having any emission of the kind, and some even without any kind of pleasurable sensation whatsoever. But of these things more in another place.

The *vulva*, or *vagina uteri*, which extends from the *os externum* to the inner orifice of the uterus, is situated in the hind, as well as in the human female, between the urinary bladder and the *intestinum rectum*, and corresponds in length, width, and general dimensions, with the penis of the male. When this part is laid open it is found occupied lengthwise by *rugae* and furrows, admitting of ready distension, and lubricated with a sluggish fluid. At its bottom we observe a very narrow and small orifice, the commencement of the *cervix uteri*, by which whatever is propelled outwards from the cavity of the uterus must pass. This is the corresponding orifice to that which medical men assert is

so firmly closed and sealed up in the pregnant woman and virgin, that it will not even admit the point of a probe or fine needle.

The *os uteri* is followed by the *cervix* or process, which is much longer and rounder than in woman, and also more fibrous, thicker, and nervous; it extends from the bottom of the vagina to the body of the *uterus*. If this *cervix uteri* be divided longitudinally, you perceive not only its external orifice at the bottom of the vagina, its surface in close contact, and so firmly agglutinated that not even air blown into the vagina will penetrate the cavity of the *uterus*, but five other similar constrictions placed in regular order, firmly contracted against the entrance of any foreign body and sealed with gelatinous mucus; just as we find the narrow orifice of the woman’s *uterus* plugged with a yellowish glutinous mass. A like constriction of parts, all firmly closed, and precluding all possibility of entrance, Fabricius has found in the uterine neck of the sheep, sow, and goat. In the deer there are very distinctly five of these constrictions, or so many orifices of the *uterus* constricted and conglutinated, which may all justly be looked upon as so many barriers against the entrance of anything from without. Such particular care has nature taken, that if the first barrier were forced by any cause or violence, the second should still stand good, and so the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, determined apparently that nothing should enter. A probe pushed from within outwards, however, from the cavity of the *uterus* towards the vagina, passes through readily. A way had to be left open for the escape of flatus, menstrual blood, and other excreted fluids; but even the smallest and most subtile things, air, for instance, and the seminal fluid are precluded all access from without.

In all animals this uterine orifice is found obstructed or plugged up in the same way as it is wont to be in women, among whom we have sometimes known the outlet so much constricted that the menses, lochia, and other humours were retained in the womb, and became the exciting cause of most severe hysterical symptoms. In such cases it became necessary to contrive a suitable instrument with which the *os uteri* being opened, the matters that stagnated within were discharged, when all the accidents disappeared. By this contrivance injections could also be thrown into the cavity of the *uterus*, and by means of these I have cured internal ulcers of the womb, and have occasionally even found a remedy for barrenness.

The cavity of the *uterus* in the deer is extremely small, and the thickness of its walls not great; the body of the womb in these animals is, in fact, but a kind of vestibule, or ante-room, in the cavity of which a passage opens to the right and left into either *cornu*.

For the parts are different in almost all animals from what they are in woman, in whom the principal part of the *uterus* is its body, and the *cervix* and *cornua* are mere appendices, that scarcely attract attention. The neck is short; the *cornua* are slender round processes extending from the *fundus uteri* like a couple of tubes, which anatomists indeed commonly speak of as the *vasa ejaculatoria*. In the deer, however, as in all other quadrupeds, except the ape and the *solipeds*, the chief organ of generation is not the body but the horns of the *uterus*. In the human female and the *solipeds*, the *uterus* is the place of conception, in all the rest the conception is perfected in the *cornua*; and this is the reason why writers so commonly speak of the *cornua uteri* in the lower animals under the simple name of the *uterus*, saying that the *uterus* in certain animals is bipartite, whilst in others it is not, understanding by the word *uterus* the place in which conception takes place, this in the majority of viviparous and especially of multiparous animals being the *cornua*, to which, moreover, all the arteries and veins distributed to the organs of generation are sent. We shall, therefore, in treating of the history of generation in the deer employ the words *uterus* and horns of the *uterus* promiscuously.

In the human female, as I have said, the two tubes that arise near the *cervix uteri* and there perforate its cavity have no analogy to the parts generally called *cornua*, but, on the contrary, in the mind of some anatomists, to the *vasa spermatica*. By others again they are called the *spiramenta uteri* — the breathing tubes of the *uterus*; and by others still they are called the *vasa deferentia seu reservantia*, as if they were of the same nature as the canals so designated in the male; whilst they in fact correspond to the *cornua* of the *uterus* in other animals, as most clearly appears from their situation, connexion, length, perforation, general resemblance, and also office. For as many of the lower animals regularly conceive in the *cornua uteri*, so do women occasionally carry their conceptions in the *cornu*, or this tube, as the learned Riolanus^ has shown from the observations of others, and as we ourselves have found it with our own eyes.

^ *Anthropologia*, ii. 34.

These *cornua* terminate in a common cavity which, as stated, forms a kind of porch or vestibule to the *uterus*, and corresponds in the deer to the neck of the womb in women; in the same way as the tubes in question in the human female correspond to the *cornua uteri* in the deer. Now this name of *cornua* has been derived from the resemblance of the parts to the horns of an animal; and in the same way as the horns of a goat or ram are ample at the base, arched and protuberant in front, and bent-in behind, so are these horns of the *uterus* in the hind and doe capacious inferiorly, and taper gradually off superiorly, as they are reflected towards the spine. Further, as the horns of the animal are unequally tuberculated and uneven in front, but smooth behind, so are the horns of the *uterus* tuberculated, as it were, and uneven, through the presence of cells, something like those of the colon, inferiorly and anteriorly; but superiorly, and on the aspect towards the spine, they are continuous and smooth, and present themselves secured and bound down by a ligamentous band; they at the same time gradually decrease in size like horns. Did one take a piece of empty intestine, such as is used for making sausages, and drawing a tape through it, tied this on one side, he would have it puckered and constricted on that side, and thrown into cells similar to those of the colon on the opposite side. Such is the structure of the *cornua* of the *uterus* in the hind and doe. In other animals it is different; for there the cells are either much larger, or they are entirely wanting. The cells of the *cornua uteri* of the hind and doe, however, are not all of the same size; the first that is met with is much larger than any of the others; and here it is that the conception is generally lodged.

As the *uterus*, tubes, or *cornua*, and other parts appertaining in the human female are connected with the pubes, spine, and surrounding structures by the medium of broad and fleshy membranes, by suspensory bands, as it were, which anatomists have designated by the name of bats’ wings, because they have found that the *uterus* suspended in this way resembled a bat with its wings expanded, so also are the *cornua uteri*, together with the *testes* [ovaries], on either side, and all the uterine vessels, connected with the neighbouring parts, particularly with the spine, by means of a firm membrane, within the folds of which are suspended all the parts that have been mentioned, and which serves the same office with reference to these uterine structures as the *mesentery* does to the intestines, and the *mesometrium* to the *uterus* of the fowl. In the same way, too, as the mesenteric arteries and veins are distributed to the intestines through the *mesentery*, are the uterine vessels distributed to the *uterus* through the membrane in question; in which also certain vessels and glands are perceived on either side, which by anatomists are generally designated the *testicles* [the ovaries].

The substance of the horns of the *uterus* in the hind and doe is skinny or fleshy, like the coats of the intestines, and has a few very minute veins ramified over it. This substance you may in anatomical fashion divide into several layers, and note different courses of its component fibres, fitting them to perform the several motions and actions required, retention, namely, and expulsion. I have myself frequently seen these *cornua* moving like earthworms, or in the manner in which the intestines may at any time be observed, twisting themselves with an undulatory motion, on laying open the abdomen of a recently slaughtered animal, by which they move on the chyle and excrements to inferior portions of the gut, as if they were surrounded and compressed with a ring forced over them, or were stripped between the fingers.

The uterine veins, as in woman, all arise from the *vena cava*, near the *emulgents*; the arteries (and this also is common to the deer and the human subject) arise from the crural branches of the descending *aorta*. And as in the pregnant woman the uterine vessels are relatively larger and more numerous than in any other part of the body, this is likewise the case in the pregnant hind and doe. The arteries, however, contrary to the arrangement in other parts of the body, are much more numerous than the veins; and air blown into them makes its way into the neighbouring veins, although the arteries cannot be inflated in their turn by blowing into the veins. This fact I also find mentioned by Master Riolanus; and it is a cogent argument for the circulation of the blood discovered by me; for he clearly proves that whilst there is a passage from the arteries into the veins, there is none backwards from the veins into the arteries. The arteries are more numerous than the veins, because a large supply of nourishment being required for the foetus, it is only what is left unused that has to be returned by the latter channels.

In the deer as well as in the sheep, goat, and bisulcate animals generally, we find *testicles*; but these are mere little glands, which rather correspond in their proportions to the prostate or mesenteric glands, the use of which is to establish divarications for the veins, and to store up a fluid for lubricating the parts, rather than for secreting *semen*, concocting it into fecundity, and shedding it at the time of intercourse. I am myself especially moved to adopt this opinion, as well by numerous reasons which will be adduced elsewhere, as by the fact that in the rutting season, when the *testes* of the buck and hart enlarge and are replete with *semen*, and the *cornua uteri* of the hind and doe are greatly changed, the female *testicles*, as they are called, whether they be examined before or after intercourse, neither swell nor vary from their usual condition; they show no trace of being of the slightest use either in the business of intercourse or in that of generation.

It is surprising what a quantity of seminal fluid is found in the *vesiculae seminales* and *testicles* of moles and the larger kinds of mice at the season of intercourse; this circumstance corresponds with what we have already noticed in the cock, and the great change perceptible in the organs of generation of both sexes; nevertheless, the glands, which are regarded as the female *testes*, continue all the while unchanged and without departure from their pristine appearance.

All that has now been said of the *uterus* and its horns in hinds and does applies in major part to viviparous animals in general, but not to the human female, inasmuch as she conceives in the body of the *uterus*, but all these, with the exception of the horse and ass, in the horns of the organ; and even the horse and ass, although they appear to carry their fruit in the *uterus*, still is the place of the conception in them rather of the nature of an uterine horn than the uterine body. For the place here is not bipartite indeed, but it is oblong, and different from the human *uterus* both in its situation, connexions, structure, and substance; it bears a greater affinity to the superior *uterus* or uterine process of the fowl, where the egg grows and becomes surrounded with the *albumen*, than to the *uterus* of the woman.

## EXERCISE 66. Of the intercourse of the hind and doe

So much for the account of the *uterus* of the female deer, where we have spoken briefly upon all that seemed necessary to the history of generation, viz., the place of conception, and the parts instituted for its sake. We have still to speak of the action and office of this place, in other words, of intercourse and conception.

The hind and doe admit the male at one and only one particular season of the year, namely, in the middle of September, after the Feast of the Holy Cross; and they bring forth after the middle of June, about the Feast of St. John the Baptist (24th June). They, therefore, go with young about nine months, not eight, as Pliny says;^ with us, at all events, they produce in the ninth month after they have taken the buck.

^ *Hist. Nat.*, VIII, 32.

At the rutting season the bucks herd with the does; at other times they keep severally apart, the males, particularly the older ones, associating together, and the females and younger males trooping and feeding in company. The rutting season lasts for a whole month, and it begins later if the weather have been dry, earlier if it have been wet. In Spain, as I am informed, the deer are hardly in rut before the beginning of October, wet weather not usually setting in there until this time; but with us the rutting season rarely continues beyond the middle of October.

At this time deer are rendered savage by desire, so that they will attack both dogs and men, although at other seasons they are so timid and peaceable, and immediately betake themselves to flight on the barking of even the smallest dog.

Every male knows all his own females, nor will he suffer any one of them to wander from his herd: with a run he speedily drives back any straggler; he walks jealously from time to time among his wives; looks circumspectly about him, and the careful guardian of his own, he shows himself the watchful sentinel. If a strange doe commit any offence, he does not pursue her very eagerly, but rather suffers her to get away; but if another buck approach he instantly runs to meet him, and gives him battle with his antlers.

The hind and doe are held among the number of the chaster animals; they suffer the addresses of the male reluctantly, who, like the bull, mounts with violence, and unless forced or tired out, they resist him; which disinclination of the females appears also to be the reason of their herding together, and confining themselves to their own males, who are always the older and better armed; for when any strange male approaches them they immediately take to flight, and seek refuge in their own herd, and protection to their chastity, as it seems, from their proper husband.

If a younger male finds a female straying alone, he immediately pursues her, and when she is worn out and unable to fly farther he mounts and forces her to his pleasure.

The males all provide themselves what are called rutting places; that is to say, they dig a trench, or they take their stand upon an acclivity, whither they compel their females to come in turn. The female that is to be leapt stands with her hind feet in the trench prepared for the purpose, stooping or lowering her haunches somewhat, if need be; by which the male is enabled, pressing forward upon her in the same way as a bull, to strike her, in technical language, and finish the business of copulation at one assault.

Old and sturdy bucks have a considerable number of does in their herds, as many as ten, and even fifteen; younger and weaker males have fewer. Keepers say that the doe is sated with two, or at most with three leaps; once she has conceived she admits the male no more.

The lust of the male cools when he has served his females; he becomes shyer, and much leaner; he deserts his herd and roams alone, and feeds greedily to repair his wasted strength, nor does he afterwards approach a female for a whole year.

When the male is capable of intercourse the hair on his throat and neck grows black, and the extremity of the prepuce becomes of the same colour, and stinks abominably. The females take the male but rarely, and only in the night or in dusky places, which are, therefore, always chosen by the males for their connubial pleasures. When two stags engage in battle, as frequently happens, the vanquished yields possession of his females to the victor.

## EXERCISE 67. Of the constitution or change that takes place in the *uterus* of the deer in the course of the month of September

We now come to the changes that take place in the genital parts of the female after intercourse, and to the conception itself. In the month of September, then, when the female deer first comes in season, her *cornua uteri*, *uterus*, or place of conception, grows somewhat more fleshy and thick, softer also, and more tender. In the interior of either *cornu*, at that part, namely, which looks drawn together by a band, and is turned towards the spine, we observe, protruding in regular succession, five *caruncles*, soft warts, or papillae. The first of these is larger than any of the others, and each in succession is smaller than the one before it, just as the *cornua* themselves become smaller and smaller towards their termination. Some of the *caruncles* grow to the thickness of the largest finger, and look like proud flesh; some are white, others of a deeper red.

From the 26th to the 28th of September, and also subsequently, in the month of October, the *uterus* becomes thicker, and the *carunculae* mentioned come to resemble the nipples of the woman’s breast: you might fancy them ready to pour out milk. Having removed their apex that I might examine their internal structure, I found them made up of innumerable white points compacted together, like so many bristles erect, and connected by means of a certain mucous viscidity; compressed between the fore finger and thumb, from the base upwards, a minute drop of blood oozed out from each point, a fact which led me, after further investigation, to conclude that they were entirely made up of the capillary branches of arteries.

During the season of intercourse, therefore, the uterine vessels, particularly the arteries, are observed to be more numerous and of larger size; although the parts called the female *testes*, as I have said above, are neither larger nor more highly gorged with blood than before, and do not appear to be altered in any way from their former state.

The inner aspect of the *uterus* or *cornua uteri*, where it is puckered into cells, is as smooth and soft as the ventricles of the brain, or the *glans penis* within the prepuce. Nothing, however, can be discovered there — neither the *semen* of the male, nor aught else having reference to the conception— during the whole of the months of September and October, although I have instituted repeated dissections with a view of examining the conception at this period. The males have been doing their duty all the while; nevertheless, reiterated dissection shows nothing. This is the conclusion to which I have come, after many years of observation. I have only occasionally found the five *caruncles* so close together that they formed a kind of continuous protuberance into the interior of the *uterus*. But when, after repeated inspections, I still found nothing more in the *uterus*, I began to doubt, and to ask myself whether the *semen* of the male could by any possibility make its way — by attraction or injection — to the seat of the conception? And repeated examination led me to the conclusion that none of the *semen* whatsoever reached this seat.

## EXERCISE 68. Of what takes place in the month of October

Repeated dissections performed in the course of the month of October, both before the rutting season was over and after it had passed, never enabled me to discover any blood or *semen*, or a trace of anything else, either in the body of the *uterus* or in its *cornua*. The *uterus* was only a little larger, and somewhat thicker; and the *caruncles* were more tumid and florid, and, when strongly pressed with the finger, discharged small drops of blood, much in the manner in which a little watery milk can be squeezed from the nipples of a woman in the fourth month of her pregnancy. In one or two does, indeed, I found a green and ichorous matter, like an abscess, filling the cavity of the *uterus*, which was preternaturally extenuated; in other respects these animals were healthy, and in as good condition as others which I examined at the same time.

Towards the end of October and beginning of November, the rutting season being now ended, and the females separating themselves from the males, the *uterus* begins (in some sooner, in others later) to shrink in size, and the walls of its internal cavity, inflated in appearance, to bulge out; for where the cells existed formerly there are now certain globular masses projecting internally, which nearly fill the whole cavity, by which the sides are brought into mutual contact, and almost agglutinated, as it seems, so that there is no interval between them. Even as we have seen the lips of boys who, in robbing a hive, had been stung in the mouth, swollen and enlarged, so that the oral aperture was much contracted, even so does the internal surface of the *uterus* in the doe enlarge, and become filled with a soft and pulpy substance, like the matter of the brain, that fills its cavity and involves the *caruncles*, which, though not larger than before, look whiter, and as if they had been steeped in hot water, much as the nurse’s nipple appears immediately after the infant has quitted it. And now I have not found it possible by any compression to force blood out of the *caruncles* as before.

Nothing can be softer, smoother, more delicate, than the inner aspect of the *uterus* thus raised into tubers. It rivals the ventricles of the brain in softness, so that without the information of the eye we should scarcely perceive by the finger that we were touching any thing. When the abdomen is laid open immediately after the death of the animal, I have frequently seen the *uterus* affected with a wavy and creeping motion, such as is perceived in the lower part of a slug or snail whilst it is moving, as if the *uterus* were an animal within an animal, and possessed a proper and independent motion. I have frequently observed a movement of the same kind as that just described in the intestines, whilst engaged in vivisections; and indeed such a motion can both be seen and felt in the bodies of dogs and rabbits whilst they are alive and uninjured. I have also observed a corresponding motion in the *testes* and *scrotum* of men; and I have even known women upon whom, in their eagerness for offspring, such palpitations have imposed. But whether the *uterus* in hysterical females, by ascending, descending, and twisting, experiences any such motion or not, I cannot take upon me to declare; and whether the brain, in its actions and conceptions, moves in anything of a similar manner or not, though a point difficult of investigation, I am inclined to look upon as one by no means unworthy of being attempted.

Shortly afterwards, the tubercular elevations of the inner surface of the *uterus* that have been mentioned begin to shrink; it is as if, losing a quantity of moisture, they became less plump. In some instances, indeed, though rarely, I have observed something like purulent matter adhering to them, such as is usually seen on the surface of wounds and ulcers when they are digested, as it is said, they pour out smooth and homogeneous pus. When I first saw this matter, I doubted whether it was the *semen* of the male or not, or a substance concocted from its purer portion. But as it was only in exceedingly rare instances that I met with such matter, and as twenty days had then passed since the doe had had any intercourse with the buck, and further, as the matter was not viscid and tenacious, or spumous, such as the seminal fluid presents itself to us, but rather friable, purulent looking, and inclining to yellow, I came to the conclusion that it was the effect of accident, a sweat or exudation in consequence of violent exercise previous to death; just as in a catarrh the thinner defluxion of the nose is by and by changed into a thicker mucus.

Having frequently shown this alteration in the *uterus* to his majesty the king as the first indication of pregnancy, and satisfied him at the same time that there was nothing in the shape of *semen* or conception to be found in the cavity of the organ, and he had spoken of this as an extraordinary fact to several about him, a discussion at length arose: the keepers and huntsmen asserted at first that it was but an argument of a tardy conception occasioned by the want of rain. But by and by, when they saw the rutting season pass away, I still continuing to maintain that things were in the same state, they began to say that I was both deceived myself and had misled the king, and that there must of necessity be something of the conception to be found in the *uterus*. These men, however, when I got them to bring their own eyes to the inquiry, soon gave up the point. The physicians, nevertheless, held it among their *ἀδύνατα* — their impossibilities — that any conception should ever be formed without the presence of the *semen masculinum*, or some trace remaining of a fertile intercourse within the cavity of the womb.

That this important question might be the more satisfactorily settled in all time to come, his highness the king ordered about a dozen does to be separated from the bucks towards the beginning of October, and secluded in the enclosure, which is called the course, at Hampton Court, because the animal placed there has no means of escape from the dogs let loose upon it. Now that no one might say the animals thus secluded retained any of the *semen* received from the last connexions with the male, I dissected several of them before the rutting season had passed, and ascertained that no seminal fluid remained in the *uterus*, although the others were found to be pregnant in consequence of the preceding intercourse — impregnated by a kind of contagion as it appears — and duly produced their fawns at the proper time.

In the dog, rabbit, and several other animals, I have found nothing in the *uterus* for several days after intercourse. I therefore regard it as demonstrated that after fertile intercourse among viviparous as well as oviparous animals, there are no remains in the *uterus* either of the *semen* of the male or female emitted in the act, nothing produced by any mixture of these two fluids, as medical writers maintain, nothing of the menstrual blood present as “matter” in the way Aristotle will have it; in a word, that there is not necessarily even a trace of the conception

to be seen immediately after a fruitful union of the sexes. It is not true, consequently, that in a prolific connexion there must be any prepared matter in the uterus which the *semen masculinum*, acting as a coagulating agent, should congeal, concoct, and fashion, or bring into a positive generative act, or, by drying its outer surface, include in membranes. Nothing certainly is to be seen within the uterus of the doe for a great number of days, namely, from the middle of September up to the 12th of November.

It appears, moreover, that all females do not shed seminal fluid into the uterus during intercourse; that there is no trace either of seminal fluid or menstrual blood in the uterus of the hind or doe, and many other viviparous animals. But as to what it is which is shed by women of warmer temperament no less than by men during intercourse, accompanied with failure of the powers and voluptuous sensations; whether it be necessary to fecundation, whether it come from the *testes femininae*, and whether it be semen and prolific, is discussed by us elsewhere.

And whilst I speak of these matters, let gentle minds forgive me, if, recalling the irreparable injuries I have suffered, I here give vent to a sigh. This is the cause of my sorrow: whilst in attendance on his majesty the king during our late troubles and more than civil wars, not only with the permission but by command of the Parliament, certain rapacious hands stripped not only my house of all its furniture, but what is subject of far greater regret with me, my enemies abstracted from my museum the fruits of many years of toil. Whence it has come to pass that many observations, particularly on the generation of insects, have perished, with detriment, I venture to say, to the republic of letters.

## EXERCISE 69. Of what takes place in the uterus of the doe during the month of November

Taught by the experience of many years I can state truly that it is from the 12th to the 14th of November that I first discover anything which belongs to the future offspring in the uterus of the hind.

I remember, indeed, that in the year of grace 1633, the signs of conception, or the commencements of the embryos, made their appearance somewhat earlier; because the weather was then cloudy and wet. In does, too, which have rutted six or seven days sooner than hinds, I have always discovered something of the future *foetus* about the 8th or 9th of November. What this is and how it is begun I shall proceed to state.

A little before anything is perceptible, the substance of the uterus or its horns appears less than it was before the animals began to rut, the white caruncles are more flaccid, as I have said, and the protuberances of the internal coat subside somewhat, and are corrugated and look moist. For about the date above mentioned certain mucous filaments like spiders’ webs are observed drawn from the extremities, or superior angles of the *cornua* through the middle of either, and also through the body of the uterus. These filaments becoming conjoined present themselves as a membranous and gelatinous tunic or empty sac. Even as the *plexus choroides* is extended through the ventricles of the brain, is this oblong sac produced through the whole of either horn and the intervening cavity of the uterus, insinuating itself between the wrinkles of the flabby internal tunic, and sending delicate fibres among the afore-mentioned rounded protuberances, being nearly in the same manner as the *pia mater* dips between the convolutions of the brain.

Within a day or two this sac becomes filled with a clear, watery, sluggish albuminous matter, and now presents itself as a long-shaped pudding full of fluid. It adheres by its external glutinous matter to the containing walls of the uterus, but so that it is still easily separated from these; for if it be taken hold of cautiously in the strait of the uterus, where it is constricted in its course, it can be drawn entire out of either horn.

The conception arrived at this stage removed entire, presents itself with the figure of a wallet or double pudding; externally, it is covered with a purulent-looking matter; internally, it is smooth, and contains in its cavity a viscid fluid not unlike the thinner white of egg.

This is the conception of the hind and doe in its first stage. And since it has now the nature and state of an egg, and the definition given by Aristotle of an egg is applicable to it, namely:
> “A body from one part of which an animal is produced, the remainder serving as nourishment to that which is engendered.”[^1]
And further, as it is the *primordium* of the future *foetus*, it is therefore called the *ovum*, or egg of the animal, in conformity with that passage of the philosopher where he says:
> “Those animals which engender internally have a certain oviform body produced after the first conception. For a humour is included within a delicate membrane, such as that which you find under the shell in the egg of the hen; wherefore the blightings of conceptions that are apt to take place about this period are called fluxes.”[^2]
This conception, therefore, as we have already said of the egg, is the true *sperma* or seed, comprising the virtue of both sexes in itself, and is analogous to the seed of the vegetable. So that Aristotle, describing the first conception of women, says that it is
> “covered with a membrane like an egg from which the shell has been removed”[^3]
such as Hippocrates describes as having been passed by the female pipe-player. And I have myself frequently seen such *ova*, of the size of pigeons’ eggs, and containing no *foetus*, discharged by women about the second month after conception; when the *ovum* was of the size of a pheasant’s or hen’s egg, the embryo could be made out, the size of the little fingernail, floating within it. But the membrane surrounding the conception has not yet acquired any annexed placenta; neither is it connected with the uterus; there is only at its upper and blunter part a kind of delicate mossy or woolly covering which stands for the rudiments of the future placenta. The inner aspect is smooth and polished, and covered with numerous ramifications of the umbilical vessels. In the third month this *ovum* exceeds a goose’s egg in size, and includes a perfect embryo of the length of two fingers’ breadths. In the fourth month it is larger than an ostrich’s egg. All these things I have noted in the numerous careful dissections of aborted *ova* which I have made.

In the way above indicated do the hind and doe, affected by a kind of contagion, finally conceive and produce *primordia*, of the nature of eggs, or the seeds of plants, or the fruit of trees, although for a whole month and more they had exhibited nothing in the uterus, the conception being perfected about the 18th, at furthest the 21st of November, and having its seat now in the right, now in the left horn, occasionally in both at once. The *ovum* at this time is full of a colliquate matter, transparent, crystalline, similar to that fluid which in the hen’s egg we have called the *colliquament* or eye, of far greater purity than that fluid in which the embryo by and by floats, and contained within a proper tunic of extreme tenuity, and orbicular in form. In the middle of the *ovum*, vascular ramifications and the *punctum saliens*—the first or rudimentary particle of the *foetus*—and nothing else, are clearly to be perceived. This is the first genital part, which, once constituted, is not only already possessed by the vegetative, but also by the motive soul; and from this are all the other parts of the *foetus*, each in its order, generated, fashioned, disposed, and endowed with life, almost in the same manner as we have described the chick to be produced from the *colliquament* of the egg.

Both of the humours mentioned are present in the conceptions of all viviparous animals, and are regarded by many as the excrements of the *foetus*—one the urine, the other the sweat, although neither of them has any unpleasant taste, and they are always and at all periods present in conceptions, even before a particle of the *foetus* has been produced.

Of the membranes investing the two fluids, of which there are only two, the outer is called the *chorion*, the inner the *amnion*. The *chorion* includes the whole conception, and extends into either *cornu*; the *amnion* swimming in the midst of the liquid of the former, is found in one of the horns only, except in the cases where there is a twin conception, when there is an *amnion* present in each of them; just as in a twin-fraught egg there are two *colliquaments*. Where there are two *foetuses* consequently, both are contained in one common conception, in one egg, as it were, with its two separate collections of crystalline fluid included. If you incise the external membrane at any point, the more turbid fluid which it contains immediately escapes from either horn of the uterus; but the crystalline liquid in the interior of the *amnion* does not escape at the same time unless the membrane have been simultaneously implicated.

The vein which is first discerned in the crystalline fluid within the *amnion* takes its rise from the *punctum saliens*, and assumes the nature and duty of an umbilical vessel; increasing by degrees it expands into various ramifications distributed through the *colliquament*, so that it seems certain that the nourishment is in the first instance derived from the *colliquament* alone in which the *foetus* swims.

I have exhibited to his Serene Highness the King, this point still palpitating in the uterus laid open; it was extremely minute indeed, and without the advantage of the sun's light falling upon it from the side, its tremulous motions were not to be perceived.

When the *ovum* with the *colliquament* entire was placed in a silver or pewter basin filled with tepid water, the *punctum saliens* became beautifully distinct to the spectators. In the course of the next ensuing days, a mucilage or jelly, like a tiny worm, and having the shape of a maggot, is found to be added; this is the rudiment of the future body. It is divided into two parts, one of which is the head, the other the trunk, precisely in the same way as we have already seen it in the generation of the chick *in ovo*. The spine, like a keel, is somewhat bent; the head is indifferently made up of three small vesicles or globules, and swimming in transparent water grows amain, and by degrees assumes its proper shape. There is only this to be observed, that the eye in embryos of oviparous animals is much larger and more conspicuous than that of viviparous animals.

After the 26th of November the *foetus* is seen with its body nearly perfect, in one case in the right in another in the left horn of the uterus; in twin cases in both horns.

At this time, too, the male embryo is readily distinguishable from the female by means of the organs of generation. These parts are also very conspicuous in the human embryo, and make their appearance at the same time as the trachea.

Males and females are met with indifferently in the right and left horn of the uterus. I have, however, more frequently found females in the right, males in the left horn; and I have made the same observation in does that carried twins, as well as in the sheep. It is certain, therefore, that the right or left side has no appropriate virtue in conferring sex; neither is the uterus, nor yet the mother herself, the fashioner or framer of the *foetus*, any more than the hen is of the pullet in the egg which she incubates. In the same way as the pullet is formed and fashioned in the egg by an internal and inherent agent, is the *foetal* form produced from the uterine *ovum* of the hind and doe.

It is indeed matter of astonishment to find a *foetus* formed and perfected within the *amnion* in so short a space of time after the first appearance of the blood and *punctum saliens*. On or about the 19th or 20th day of November this *punctum* first becomes visible; on the 21st the shapeless *vermiculus* or maggot that is to form the body of the future animal is perceived; and in the course of from six to seven days afterwards a *foetus* so perfect in all its parts is seen, that a male can be distinguished from a female by the organs of generation, and the feet are formed, the hooves being cleft, the whole having a mucous consistency and a pale yellowish colour.

The substance of the uterus begins to be extenuated immediately after the appearance of the embryo; contrary to what takes place in the human female, whose uterus grows every day thicker and fleshier with the advancing growth of the *foetus*. In the hind and doe, on the other hand, the more the embryo augments the more do the *cornua* of the uterus assimilate themselves to the intestines; that horn in particular in which the *foetus* is contained looks like a bag or pouch, and exceeds the opposite one in dimensions.

The *ovum* or conception, thus far advanced, and with its included *foetus* perfectly distinct, has still contracted no adhesions to its mother’s sides: the whole can most readily be withdrawn from the uterus, as I have ascertained with an *ovum* which contained a *foetus* nearly the length of the thumb. It is manifest, therefore, that the *foetus* up to this period has been nourished by the albumen alone that is contained within the conception; in the same way as we have ascertained the process to go on within the hen’s egg. The mouths of the umbilical veins are lost and obliterated between the albumen and neighbouring humours of the conception and their containing membranes; but nowhere is there as yet any connexion with the uterus, although by these veins alone is nourishment supplied to the embryo. And as in the egg the ramifications of the veins are first sent to the *colliquament* (in the same way as the roots of trees penetrate the ground) and afterwards take their course to the external tunic called the *chorion*, whereon, for the sake of the nourishment, they are dispersed in an infinity of ramifications through the albuminous fluid contained within the outer membrane, so have I observed veins in the *chorion* of a human abortion; and Aristotle also states
> “that membrane to be crowded with veins.”[^4]

If the *foetus* be single its umbilical vessels are distributed to both horns, and a few twigs are also sent to the intervening body of the uterus; but if the conception be double, one in either horn, each sends its umbilical vessels to its own horn alone; the embryo in the right horn deriving nourishment from the right part of the conception, that in the left from the left portion of the same. In other respects the twin-conception here is precisely similar to the twin-conception of the egg.

Towards the end of November, then, all the parts are clearly and distinctly to be distinguished, and the *foetus* is now of the size of a large bean or nutmeg; its occiput is prominent, as in the chick, but its eyes are smaller; the mouth extends from ear to ear, the cheeks and lips, as consisting of membranous parts, being perfected at a very late period. In the *foetuses* of all animals, indeed, that of man inclusive, the oral aperture without lips or cheeks is seen stretching from ear to ear; and this is the reason, unless I much mistake, why so many are born with the upper lip divided as it is in the hare and camel, whence the common name of harelip for the deformity. In the development of the human *foetus* the upper lip only coalesces in the middle line at a very late period.

I have frequently put a *foetus* the size of a large bean, swimming in its extremely pure nutritive fluid within the transparent *amnion*, into a silver basin filled with the clearest water, and have noted these particulars as most worthy of observation: the brain of somewhat greater consistency than white of egg, like milk moderately coagulated, and of an irregular shape, and without any covering of skull, is contained within a general investing membrane. The cerebellum projects in a peak, as in the chick. The conical mass of the heart is of a white colour, and all the other viscera, the liver inclusive, are white and spermatic-looking. The trunk of the umbilical veins arises from the heart, and passing the convexity of the liver, perforates the trunk of the *vena portae*, whence, advancing a little and subdividing into a great number of branches, it is distributed to the *colliquament* and *tunica choroidea* in innumerable fine filaments. The sides of the body ascend on either hand from the spine, so that the thorax presents itself in the guise of a boat or small vessel, up to the period at which the heart and lungs are included within its area, precisely and in all respects as we have seen it in the development of the chick. The heart, intestines, and other viscera, are very conspicuous, and present themselves as appendages of the body, until the thorax and abdomen being drawn around them, and the roof, as it were, put on the building, they are concealed within the *compages* of these cavities. At this time the sides both of the thorax and abdomen are white, gelatinous, and apparently identical in structure, save that a number of slender white lines are perceived in the walls of the thorax, as indications of the future ribs, whereby a distinction is here made between the bony and fleshy *compages* of the cavity.

I have also occasionally observed in conceptions of the sheep, which were sometimes twin, sometimes single, of corresponding age and about a finger’s breadth in length, that the form of the embryo resembled a small lizard of the size of a wasp or caterpillar; the spine being curved into a circle, and the head almost in contact with the tail. In the double conceptions both were of the same size, as if produced at once and simultaneously; each floated distinctly within the fluid of its own *amnion*; but although one lay in the right, the other in the left horn of the uterus, they were still both included in the same double sac or wallet, both belonged to the same *ovum*, and were surrounded by the same common external fluid. The mouth was large, but the eyes were mere points, so that they could scarcely be seen, very different, therefore, from what occurs among birds. The viscera in these embryos were also pendulous without the body, not yet enclosed within the appropriate cavities. The outer membrane or *chorion* adhered in no way to the uterus, so that the entire conception was readily removed. Within the substance of the *chorion* innumerable branches of the umbilical vessels were conspicuous, but having no connexion whatsoever with the walls of the uterus; a circumstance to which allusion has already been made in the case of the deer; the distribution was in fact very much as we have found it on the external tunic of the hen’s egg. There were but two humours, and the same number of containing tunics, of which the *chorion* extending through both *cornua*, and full of a more turbid fluid, gave general configuration to the *ovum* or conception. The *tunica amnios* again is almost invisible, like the *tunica arachnoides* of the eye, and embraces the crystalline humour in which the embryo floats.

The fluid of the *amnion* was, in proportion, but a hundredth, or shall I say a thousandth, to that of the *chorion*; although the crystalline humour of the *amnion* was still in such quantity that no one could reasonably imagine it to be the sweat of the very small embryo that floated within it. It was, further, extremely limpid, and seemed to be without anything like bad taste or smell. It was, as we have already observed of the deer, in all respects like watery milk, and had none of the obnoxious qualities of an excrement. I add, that if this fluid were of an excrementitious nature it ought to increase in quantity with the growth of the *foetus*. But I have found precisely the opposite of this to obtain in the conception of the ewe, so that shortly before she lambs there is scarce a drop of the fluid in question remaining. I am, therefore, rather inclined to regard it as aliment than as excrement.

The internal tunic of the uterus of the ewe is covered with caruncles innumerable, as the heavens are with stars. These are not unlike crabs’ eyes, and I have called them by this name; but they are smaller, like pendulous warts, glandular and white, sticking within the coats of the uterus, and somewhat excavated towards the conception; otherwise than in the deer, consequently, in which the caruncles corresponding to these rather project towards the embryo. These caruncles are gorged with blood, and their inner surface, where they regard the conception, is perceived to be beset with black sanguineous points. The umbilical vessels of the embryo were not yet connected with these caruncles, nor did the conception itself adhere to the uterus.

I find nothing of an *allantois*, of which something has been said as a tunic distinct from the *chorion*, in the conception of the ewe. At a later period, indeed, when the embryo is larger, when the *ovum* or conception has contracted adhesions with the uterus, and the umbilical vessels have penetrated the caruncles, the *chorion* extends farther, and at its extremities on either side, and as it were in a couple of appendices, there is a certain fluid of a yellow colour, which you might call excrementitious, kept separate and distinct.

The human conception scarcely differs in any respect from an egg during the first months of pregnancy. I have observed a clear fluid, like the more liquid white of an egg, to be included within an extremely delicate membrane. At this time the placenta had not yet appeared, and the entire conception was of the size of a pigeon’s, or perhaps a pheasant’s egg. The embryo itself, of the length of the little fingernail, and having the form of a small frog, was conspicuous enough. The body was broad, the oral aperture widely cleft, the legs and arms like the stalks of flowers just risen above the ground, the occiput prominent, or rather forming a vesicle appended to the rest of the head, such as we have described the rudiments of the future cerebellum in the chick.

In another human conception of about the fiftieth day, the *ovum* was as large as a hen’s or a turkey’s egg. The embryo was as long as a large bean, the head of very large relative dimensions, and dominated by the cerebellum as by a kind of crest. The brain itself was of the consistence of curdled milk. Instead of a *cranium* there was a coriaceous membrane, in some places cartilaginous, and divided down the forehead to the roots of the nostrils; the face looked like the muzzle of a dog. There were no external ears, nor any nose, yet could the rudiments of the trachea passing down to the lungs, and those of the *penis*, be detected. The two auricles of the heart presented themselves like eyes, of a black colour.

In the body of a woman who died of fever I found an hermaphrodite embryo nearly of the same size. The *pudendum* was like that of the rabbit, the *labia* standing for *prepuce*, the *nymphae* for *glans*. In the upper part the root of the *penis* was also apparent, and on either side for the testicle there was the lax skin of the *scrotum*. The uterus was extremely diminutive, and in figure like that of the ewe or mole, with two horns. And as the *prostate glands* are situated near the *penis* of the boy, so were the testicles (ovaries) of visible dimensions, seen adjacent to these *cornua*. Externally considered, the sex seemed that of the male; internally, however, it was rather that of the female. The uterus of the mother was of great size, having the urinary bladder connected with it as an appendage. In the embryo, on the contrary, the bladder was large with the uterus of very small dimensions attached to it.

All the human *ova* that have been described above were, like those of the ewe, shaggy externally, and besmeared with a kind of gelatine, or glutinous matter. At this epoch, too, there was neither any placenta apparent, nor any visible connexion with the uterus; neither was there any implantation into the substance of the uterus of the umbilical vessels scattered over the surface of the conception itself.

As in the deer, so in the sheep, goat, and other bisulcated animals, do we find more than one *foetus* in the same conception, just as in twin-fraught eggs we find two chicks surrounded by the same albumen. But in the dog, rabbit, hog, and other viviparous animals that produce a considerable number at a litter, the thing is otherwise. In these each *foetus* has two humours, these being severally surrounded with their proper membranes.

In the bitch there are a number of knots or constrictions along the whole course of either *cornu* of the uterus, between each of which the appropriate humours and a single embryo are contained. In the hare and rabbit we observe a number of balls, like the eggs of serpents, so that the horns of the uterus look like a pair of bracelets composed of so many amber beads strung upon a thread. The conception of the hare bears a strong resemblance to an acorn, the placenta embracing the embryo like a cup, and the humours inclosed in their membranes depending like the gland or nut.

## EXERCISE 70. Of the conception of the deer in the course of the month of December

In the beginning of December the *foetus* is seen larger, every way more perfect, and the length of the finger. The heart and other viscera which formerly hung externally are now concealed within the cavities of the body, so that they can no longer be seen without dissection.

The conception, or *ovum*, by the medium of the five caruncles which we have already spoken of as present in either *cornu*, is now in connexion with the uterus at an equal number of points; still the union is not so strong but that a very slight rather than a great effort suffices to break it. When the conception is detached, we perceive points or depressions on the surface of the *chorion* at the places where the adhesions to the uterus had existed, these spots being further covered with a certain viscid and wrinkled matter, as if this had been the bond of union between the mother and the *ovum*. Thus have we the nature and use of these caruncles made known to us: seen in the first instance as fungi or excrescences growing from the sides of the uterus, they are now recognized in connexion with the conception, as standing instead of the placenta or uterine cake in the human subject, and performing the same office. These caruncles are in fact but as so many nipples, whence the embryo by means of its umbilical vessels re-

ceives the nourishment that is supplied by the mother, as shall be clearly shown by what is to follow.

The size and capacity of the uterus, by which name we understand the *cornua*, or place occupied by the conception, is increased in proportion to the growth of the embryo; in such wise, however, that the horn in which the foetus is lodged is larger than the other.

The conception or ovum is single, whether one or several embryos are evolved from it; and it extends, as already said, into both of the horns, so that it presents itself with the shape of a double pudding, or rather of a single pudding having a constriction in its middle. Proceeding rounded and slender from the upper extremity of one of the horns, the conception gradually enlarges, and is produced into that common cavity which in the human female is called the uterus or matrix (because, by conceiving and cherishing her offspring in this place the woman is made a mother); the conception of the deer, passing through a kind of isthmus in the body of the uterus, is narrowed; but by and by, escaping into the other *cornu*, it there expands at first, but anon contracts again, and finally ends as it began in a tapering extremity. The whole conception, therefore, taken out entire, resembles a wallet filled with water on either side; and hence the chorion is also called *allantois*, because the conception in the lower animals, such as the deer, looks like an intestine inflated, or stuffed and tied in the middle.

In the embryo anatomized at this period every internal part is seen distinct and perfect; particularly the stomach, intestines, heart, kidneys, and lungs, which, divided into lobes, but having the proper form of the organs, look bloody. The colour of the lungs is deeper than it is in those foetuses that have breathed, because the lungs, dilated by the act of respiration, assume a whiter tint. And by this indication is it known whether a mother has brought forth a living or dead child; in the former case the colour of the lungs is changed, and the change remains though the infant has died immediately afterwards.

In the female foetus the *testes*—improperly so called—are seen situated near the kidneys at the extremities of the *cornua uteri* on either side; they are relatively of larger size than in the adult, and, like the *caruncles* of the uterus, look white.

In the stomach of the foetus there is a watery fluid contained, not unlike that in which it swims, but somewhat more turbid or less transparent. It resembles the milk that begins to be secreted in the breasts of pregnant women about the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy, and may be pressed out of the nipples, or it is like the drink which we call white posset.

In the small intestines there is an abundance of chyle concocted from the same matter; in the colon greenish faeces and *scybala* begin to appear.

I do not find the *urachus* perforate; neither do I perceive any difference between the *tunica allantoides* or *allantois*, which is said to contain urine, and the chorion. Neither do I detect any urine in the secundines, but only in the bladder, where indeed it is present in large quantity. The bladder, of an oblong form, is situated between the umbilical arteries as they proceed from the bifurcation of the descending aorta.

The liver is rudely sketched and almost shapeless, as if it were a mere accidental part; it looks like a red coloured mass of extravasated blood. The brain, with some pretensions to regularity of outline, is contained within the *dura mater*. The eyes are concealed under the eyelids, which are as firmly glued together as we find them in puppies for some short time after birth, so that I found it scarcely possible to separate them and open the eyes. The breast-bones and ribs have a certain degree of firmness, and the colour of the muscles changes from white to blood red.

By the great number of dissections which I performed in the course of this month, I was every day confirmed in my opinion that the *caruncles* of the uterus perform the office of the *placenta*; they are at this time found of a reddish colour, turgid, and of the size of walnuts. The conception, which had previously adhered to the *caruncles* by the medium of *mucor* or glutinous matter only, now sends the branches of its umbilical vessels into them, as plants send their roots into the ground, by which it is fastened and may be said to grow to the uterus.

About the end of December the foetus is a span long, and I have seen it moving lustily and kicking; opening and shutting its mouth; the heart, enclosed in the pericardium, when exposed, was found pulsating strongly and visibly; its ventricles, however, were still uniform, of equal amplitude of cavity and thickness of *parietes*; and each ending in a separate apex, they form together a double-pointed cone. Occasionally, I have seen the fluid contained in the auricles of the heart, which at this time present themselves as ample sacs filled with blood, continuing to pulsate for some short time after the ventricles themselves had left off contracting.

The internal organs, all of which had lately become perfect, were now larger and more conspicuous. The skull was partly cartilaginous, partly osseous. The hooves were yellowish, flexible, and soft, resembling those of the adult animal softened in hot water. The uterine *caruncles*, of great magnitude and like immense fungi, extended over the whole cavity of the uterus, and plainly performed the office of *placentae*, for numerous and ample branches of the umbilical vessels penetrated their substance there to imbibe nutritive matter for the growth of the embryo. As in the foetus after birth, the chyle is now carried by the mesenteric veins to the *porta* of the liver.

Where there is a single foetus the umbilical vessels are distributed to the whole of the *caruncles*, both those of the horn where the foetus is lodged and those of the opposite horn; where there is a pair of embryos formed, the umbilical vessels of each only extend to the *caruncles* of the horn appropriated to it.

The smaller umbilical veins in tending towards the foetus, form larger and larger trunks by coalescing, until at length two great canals are formed, which in conjunction pour their blood into the *vena cava* and *vena portae*. But the umbilical arteries, which arise from the division of the descending aorta, form two trunks of small size, not remarkable save for their pulse: proceeding to the boundary of the conception, in other words, to the conjunction of the placenta or *caruncles* with the ramifications of the umbilical veins, they first divide into numerous capillary twigs, and then are lost in others that are invisible.

As the extremities of the umbilical veins within the uterus terminate in the *caruncles*, so the uterine vessels on the outside, which are large and numerous, and bring the blood from the mother towards the uterus, by means of the vessels of the suspensory ligaments, terminate externally on the *caruncles*. It is to be noted, also, that the internal vessels are almost all veins; the external vessels, again, are in many instances branches of arteries. In the placenta of the woman, if it be carefully examined immediately after delivery, a much larger number of arteries than of veins, and these of larger size, will be found dispersed on every side in innumerable subdivisions to the very edge of the mass. In the same kind of spongy parenchyma of the spleen, the number of the arteries is also greater than that of the veins.

The exterior uterine vessels run to the uterus, as I have said, not to the ovaries (*testiculi*) situated in the suspensory ligament, as some suppose.

I have remarked an admirable instance of the skill of nature, in the bulge or convexity of the *caruncles* turned towards the conception: a quantity of white and mucilaginous matter is discovered in a number of cavities, *cotyledones*, or little cups; these are all as full of this matter as we ever see waxen cells full of honey; now this matter, in colour, consistency, and taste, is extremely like white of egg. On tearing the conception away from the *caruncles*, you will perceive numbers of suckers or capillary branches of the umbilical veins, looking like lengthened filaments, extracted at the same time from every one of the *cotyledons* and pits, and from amidst their mucilaginous contents; very much as we see the delicate filaments of the roots of herbs following the stem when it is pulled out of the ground.

It is clearly ascertained from this that the extremities of the umbilical vessels are not conjoined by any *anastomosis* with the extremities of the uterine vessels; that they do not imbibe any blood from them, but that they end and are obliterated in that mucilaginous matter, and from it take up their nourishment, nearly in the same way as at an earlier period they had sought for aliment from the albuminous humour contained within the membranes of the conception. In the same manner, consequently, as the chick *in ovo* is nourished by the white of the egg through its umbilical vessels, is the foetus of the hind and doe nourished by a similar albuminous matter laid up in these cells, and not directly from the blood of the mother.

These *caruncles* might therefore with propriety be called the uterine liver, or the uterine *mammae*, seeing that they are organs adapted for the preparation and concoction of that albuminous aliment, and fitting it for absorption by the veins. In those viviparous animals consequently that have neither *caruncles* nor *placentae*, as the horse and the hog, the foetus is nourished up to the moment of its birth by fluids contained within the conception or ovum; nor has the ovum in these animals at any time a connexion with the uterus.

From all of what precedes it is manifest that in both the classes of viviparous animals alluded to, those, namely, that are provided with *caruncles* or *cotyledons*, and those that want them, and perhaps in viviparous animals generally, the foetus *in utero* is not nourished otherwise than the chick *in ovo*; the nutritive matter, the albumen, being of the same identical kind in all. As in the egg the terminations of the umbilical vessels are in the white and yolk, so in the hind and doe, and other animals furnished with uterine *cotyledons* like them, the final distributions of the umbilical vessels are sent to the humours that are included within the conception or ovum, and to the albumen that is stored in the *cotyledons*, or cup-like cavities of the *caruncles*, where they open and end. And this is further obvious from the fact of the extremities of the umbilical vessels, when they are drawn out of the afore-mentioned *mucor*, looking completely white; a certain proof that they absorb this mucilage liquefied only, and not blood. The same arrangement may very readily be observed to obtain in the egg.

The human placenta is rendered uneven on its convex surface, and where it adheres to the uterus, by a number of tuberous projections, and it seems indeed to adhere to the uterus by means of these; it is not consequently attached at every point, but at those places only where the vessels pierce it in search of nourishment, and at those where, in consequence of this arrangement, an appearance as if of vessels broken short off is perceived. But whether the extremities of these vessels suck up blood from the uterus, or rather a certain concocted matter of the nature of albumen, as I have described the thing in the hind and doe, I have not yet ascertained.

Finally, that the truth just announced may be still more fully confirmed, it is found that by compressing the uterine *caruncles* between the fingers, about a spoonful of the nutritive fluid in question may be obtained from each of them, as from a nipple, unmixed with blood, which is not obtained even with forcible pressure. Moreover, the *caruncle* thus milked and emptied, like a compressed sponge, contracts and becomes flaccid, and is seen to be pierced with a great number of holes. From everything, therefore, it appears that these *caruncles* are uterine *mammae*, or fountains and receptacles of nutritive albumen.

The month of December at an end, the *caruncles* adhere less firmly to the uterus than before, and a small matter suffices to detach them. The larger the foetus grows, indeed, the nearer it is to its term, the more readily are the *caruncles* detached from the uterus, so that, like ripe fruit from the tree, they slip at length from the uterus of themselves, and as if they had formed an original element in the conception.

Separated from the uterus you may perceive in the prints which they leave points pouring out blood; these are the arteries that entered them. But if you now detach the conception from the *caruncles*, no blood is effused; none escapes, save from the ends of the vessels proceeding from the conception, although it does seem more consonant with reason to suppose that blood should be shed from the *caruncles* than from the conception when they are forcibly separated. For, as the *caruncles* or *cotyledons* have an abundance of uterine branches distributed to them, and they are generally believed to receive blood for the nourishment of the foetus, we should expect that they would appear replete with blood. Nevertheless, as I have said, they yield no blood either under milking or compression, and the reason of this is that they contain albumen rather than blood, and rather store up than prepare this matter. It seems manifest, therefore, that the foetus *in utero* is not nourished by its mother’s blood, but by this albuminous fluid duly elaborated. It may even be perhaps that the adult animal is not nourished immediately by the blood, but rather by something mixed with the blood, which serves as the ultimate aliment; as may perhaps be more particularly shown in our *Physiology* and particular treatise on the blood.

The truth of that passage of Hippocrates where it is said that “those whose *acetabula* or *cotyledons* are full of *mucor*, abort,”^ has always been suspected by me; for this is no excrementitious matter or cause of miscarriage, but nourishment and a source of life. But Hippocrates, by the word *acetabula*, perhaps, understood something else than the parts so called in the uterus of the lower animals, for they are wanting in women; nor does the placenta in the human subject contain any collections of albuminous matter in distinct cavities.

^ *On the Nature of Diseases Common to Women*; see also *Aphorisms*, v. 45.

Modern medical writers, following the Arabians, speak of three nutritious humours—dew, *gluten*, and *cambium*; these Fernelius designates nutritious juices; as if he had wished to imply that the parts of our bodies were not immediately nourished by the blood as ultimate nutriment, but by these secondary juices. The first of them, like dew, bathes all the minutest particles of the body on every side: this fluid, become thicker by an ulterior concoction, and adhering to the parts, is called *gluten*; finally, altered and assimilated by the proper virtue of the part, it is called *cambium*.

He who espoused such views might designate the matter which is contained in the cotyledonous cavities of the deer as *gluten* or nutritious albumen, and maintain that as the ultimate nourishment destined for each of the particular parts of the foetus it was analogous to the albumen or *vitellus* of the egg. For as we but lately stated, with Aristotle, that the yolk of the egg was analogous to milk, so do we think it not unreasonable to assert that the matter lodged in the *cotyledons*, or *acetabula* of the uterine placenta, stands instead of milk to the foetus so long as it remains in the uterus; in this way the *caruncles* approve themselves a kind of internal *mammae*, the nutritive matter of which, transferred at the period of parturition to the proper *mammae*, there assumes the nature of milk, an arrangement by which the foetus is seen to be nourished with the same food after it has begun its independent existence, as it was whilst it lodged in the uterus. Between the two-coloured eggs of oviparous animals, consequently, or the eggs that consist of a white and a yolk, and the ova or conceptions of viviparous animals, there is only this difference, that in the former the *vitellus* (which is a secondary nutritive matter) is prepared within the egg, and at the period of birth, being stored within the abdomen of the young creature, serves it as food; whilst in the latter, the nutritive juice is laid up within *acetabula*, and after birth is transferred to the *mammae*; so that the chick is nourished with milk enclosed in its interior, whilst the foetus of the viviparous animal draws its nourishment from the breasts of its mother.

In the months of January, February, &c., as nothing new or worthy of note occurs which has not been already mentioned, (more than the growth of the hair, teeth, horns, &c.) but the parts only grow larger without reference to the process of generation, it seems unnecessary to say more upon such points at present.

I have frequently examined the conceptions of sheep during the same intervals. These I find, as in the deer, extending into both horns of the uterus, and presenting the figure of a wallet or double sausage. In several of them I found two foetuses; in others only one: they were without a trace of wool on the surface, and the eyelids were so closely glued together that they could not be opened; the hooves, however, were present. Where there were two embryos they were contained in the opposite horns of the uterus, and without any regard to sex with reference to the right or left horn, the male being sometimes in the right, sometimes in the left, and the female the same; both, however, were, in every instance, included within one and the same common external membrane or chorion. The extreme ends of this membrane were stained on either hand with a yellow or bilious excrement, and appeared to contain something turbid or excrementitious in their interior.

Many *caruncles*, or miniature placentas of different sizes, were discovered, and otherwise disposed than in the hind and doe. In the sheep they look like rounded fungi with the footstalks broken off, and are contained in the coats of the uterus; their rounded or convex aspects are turned to the uterus (a circumstance, by the way, common to the cow and sheep), their concave aspects, which are the smooth ones, being turned towards the foetus. The larger branches of the vessels are also distributed to the concave portion, as in the human placenta. The branches in extension of the umbilical vessels connected with the *caruncles*, grow pretty firmly into them, so that when I attempted to separate them, the rounded portion was rather torn from the interior of the uterus than from the ovum or conception; different, consequently, from what we observed in the deer, where the chorion was readily detached from the *cotyledons* of the *caruncles*, and where the convexity of the *caruncle*, connected with the conception, is separable, whilst the concavity, or rather the pedicle or root, is firmly adherent to the uterus. In other respects the function seems to be the same in both cases; in both the same *acetabula* are discovered, and the same viscid and albuminous mucus can be pressed out in both, as it can also in the cow.

In the conception that contains a single foetus, the umbilical vessels are distributed to the whole of the *caruncles* of either horn; but the one in which the foetus itself is contained, swimming in its crystalline fluid within the amnion, is larger than the other. In the cases where there are two foetuses present, each has its own separate or appropriate *caruncles*, and does not send its umbilical vessels in quest of nourishment beyond the *cornu* in which it is lodged.

In male foetuses, the *testes* contained in the scrotum, of large size for the age, hang externally. Female foetuses, again, have their dugs in the same situation, furnished with nipples like the breasts of women.

In the compound stomach of the foetus, namely the *omasus* and *abomasus*, a clear fluid is discovered, similar to that in which it floats; the two liquids agreeing obviously in smell, taste, and consistency. There is also a quantity of chyle in the upper part of the intestinal tube; in the inferior portion a greenish-coloured excrement and *scybala*, such as we find when the animal is feeding on grass. The liver is discovered of considerable size, the gall-bladder of an oblong shape, and in some cases empty.

In so far as the order in which the several parts are produced is concerned, we have still found the same rule to be observed in the hind and doe as in the egg, and we believe that the same law obtains among viviparous animals generally.

### EXERCISE 71. Of the innate heat

As frequent mention is made in the preceding pages of the *calidum innatum*, or innate heat, I have determined to say a few words here, by way of dessert, both on that subject and on the *humidum primigenium*, or radical moisture, to which I am all the more inclined because I observe that many pride themselves upon the use of these terms without, as I apprehend, rightly understanding their meaning. There is, in fact, no occasion for searching after spirits foreign to, or distinct from, the blood; to evoke heat from another source; to bring gods upon the scene, and to encumber philosophy with any fanciful conceits; what we are wont to derive from the stars is in truth produced at home: the blood is the only *calidum innatum*, or first engendered animal heat; a fact which so clearly appears from our observations on animal reproduction, particularly of the chick from the egg, that it seems superfluous to multiply illustrations.

There is, indeed, nothing in the animal body older or more excellent than the blood; nor are the spirits which are distinguished from the blood at any time found distinct from it; for the blood without heat or spirit is no longer blood, but *cruor* or gore. “The blood,” says Aristotle, “is hot in a certain manner, in that, namely, in virtue of which it exists as blood—just as we speak of hot-water under a single term; as subject, however, and in itself finally, blood is blood, it is not hot: so that as blood is in a certain way hot *per se*, so is it also in a certain way not hot *per se*: heat is in its essence or nature, in the same way as whiteness is in the essence of a white man; but where blood is by affection or passion, it is not hot *per se*.”^

^ *On the Parts of Animals*, ii. 3.

We physicians at this time designate that as spirit which Hippocrates called *impetum faciens*, or moving power; implying by this whatever attempts aught by its own proper effort, and causes motion with rapidity and force, or induces action of any kind; in this sense we are accustomed to speak of spirit of wine, spirit of vitriol, &c. And therefore it is that physicians admit as many spirits as there are principal parts or operations of the body, viz., animal, vital, natural, visual, auditory, concoctive, generative, implanted, influent, &c. &c. But the blood is the first produced and most principal part of the body, endowed with each and all of these virtues, possessed of powers of action beyond all the rest, and therefore, *kat’ exochen*—in virtue of its pre-eminence, meriting the title of spirit.

Scaliger, Fernelius, and others, giving less regard to the admirable qualities of the blood, have imagined other spirits of an aerial or ethereal nature, or composed of an ethereal or elementary matter, a something more excellent and divine than the innate heat, the immediate instrument of the soul, fitted for all the highest duties. Now their principal motive for this was the consideration that the blood, as composed of elements, could have no power of action beyond these elements or the bodies compounded of them. They have, therefore, feigned or imagined a spirit, different from the ingenerate heat, of celestial origin and nature; a body of perfect simplicity, most subtle, attenuated, mobile, rapid, lucid, ethereal, participant in the qualities of the quintessence. They have not, however, anywhere demonstrated the actual existence of such a spirit, or that it was superior to the elements in its powers of action, or indeed that it could accomplish more than the blood by itself. We, for our own part, who use our simple senses in studying natural things, have been unable anywhere to find anything of the sort. Neither are there any cavities for the production and preservation of such spirits, either in fact or presumed by their authors. Fernelius, indeed, has these words: “He who has not yet completely mastered the matter and state of the ingenerate heat, let him cast an eye upon the structure of the body, and turn to the arteries, and contemplate the sinuses of the heart and the ventricles of the brain. When he observes them empty, containing next to no fluid, and yet feels that he must own such parts not made in vain, or without a design, he will soon, I conceive, be brought to conclude that an extremely subtle *aura* or vapour fills them during the life of the animal, and which, as being of extreme lightness, vanished insensibly when the creature died. It is for the sake of cherishing this *aura* that by inspiration we take in air, which not only serves for the refrigeration of the body, by a business that might be otherwise accomplished, but further supplies a kind of nourishment.”^

^ *Physiologia*, iv. 2.

But we maintain that so long as an animal lives, the cavities of the heart and the arteries are filled with blood. We further believe the ventricles of the brain to be indifferently fitted for any so excellent office, and that they are rather formed for secreting some excrementitious matter. What shall we say, too, when we find the brain of many animals unfurnished with ventricles? And supposing it were true that any kind of air or vapour was found there, seeing that all nature abhors a vacuum, still it does not seem over probable that it should be of heavenly origin and possessed of such superlative virtues. But what we admire most of all is that a spirit, the native of the skies, and endowed with such admirable qualities, should be nourished by our common and elementary air; especially when we see it maintained that the elements can do nothing that is beyond their natural powers.

It is admitted, moreover, that the spirits are in a perpetual state of flux, and most readily dissipated and corrupted; nor indeed can they endure for an instant unless renovated by due supplies of their appropriate nutriment; they as much require incessant nourishing as the *primum vivens*, or first animate atom of the body. What occasion is there, then, I ask, for this extraneous inmate, for this ethereal heat? when the blood is competent to perform all the offices ascribed to it, and the spirits cannot separate from the blood even by a hair’s breadth without destruction; without the blood, indeed, the spirits can neither move nor penetrate.

penetrate anywhere as distinct and independent matters. And whether they are engendered and are fed and increased, as some suppose, from the thinner part of the blood, or from the primigenial moisture, as others imagine, all still confess that they are nowhere to be found apart from the blood, but are inseparably connected with it as the aliment that sustains them, even as the flame of a lamp or candle is inseparably connected with the oil or tallow that feeds it. The tenuity, subtlety, mobility, &c. of the spirits, therefore, bring no kind of advantage more than the blood, which it seems they constantly accompany, already possesses. The blood consequently suffices, and is adequate to be the immediate instrument of the soul, inasmuch as it is everywhere present, and moves hither and thither with the greatest rapidity. Nor can it be admitted that there are any other bodies or qualities of a spiritual and incorporeal nature, or any more divine kinds of heat, such as light, as Caesar Cremoninus,[^1] a great adept in the Aristotelian philosophy, strenuously contends against Albertus that there are.

If it be said that these spirits reside in the primigenial moisture as in their ultimate aliment, and flow from thence through the whole body to nourish its several parts, they propound a simple impossibility, viz., that the ingenerate heat, that primigenial element of the body, nourished itself, yet serves for the nourishment of the body at large. Upon such grounds the thing nourished and the thing that nourishes would be one and the same, and itself would both nourish and be nourished; which could in no way be effected; inasmuch as it is by no means probable that the nourishment should ever be mixed with the thing nourished, for things mixed must have equal powers and mutually act on one another; and, according to Aristotle’s dictum, “where there is nutrition, there is no mixture.” But as nutrition takes place everywhere, the nutriment is one thing, and that which is nourished by it is another, and it is altogether indispensable that the one pass into the other.

But as it is thought that the spirits, and the ultimate or primigenial aliment, or something else, is contained in animals, which acts in a greater degree than the blood above the forces of the elements, we are not sufficiently informed what is understood by the expression, “acting above the forces of the elements”; neither are Aristotle’s words rightly interpreted where he says, “every virtue or faculty of the soul appears to partake of another body more divine than those which are called elements. . . . For there is in every seed a certain something which causes it to be fruitful, viz., what is called heat, and that not fire or any faculty of the kind, but a spirit such as is contained in semen and frothy bodies; and the nature inherent in that spirit is responsive in its proportions to the element of the stars. Wherefore fire engenders no animal; neither is anything seen to be constituted of the dense, or moist, or dry. But the heat of the sun and of animals, and not only that which is stored up in semen, but even that of any excrementitious matter, although diverse in nature, still contains a vital principle. For the rest, it is obvious from this that the heat contained in animals is not fire, neither does it derive its origin from fire.”[^2] Now I maintain the same things of the innate heat and the blood; I say that they are not fire, and neither do they derive their origin from fire. They rather share the nature of some other, and that a more divine body or substance. They act by no faculty or property of the elements; but as there is a something inherent in the semen which makes it prolific, and as, in producing an animal, it surpasses the power of the elements — as it is a spirit, namely, and the inherent nature of that spirit corresponds to the essence of the stars — so is there a spirit, or certain force, inherent in the blood, acting superiorly to the powers of the elements, very conspicuously displayed in the nutrition and preservation of the several parts of the animal body; and the nature, yea, the soul in this spirit and blood, is identical with the essence of the stars. That the heat of the blood of animals during their lifetime, therefore, is neither fire, nor derived from fire, is manifest, and indeed is clearly demonstrated by our observations.

But that this may be made still more certain let me be permitted to digress a little from my subject, and, in a few words, to show what is meant by the word “spirit,” and what by the phrases “superior in action to the forces of the elements,” “to have the properties of another body, and that more divine than those bodies which are called elements,” and “the nature inherent in this spirit which answers to the essence of the stars.”

We have already had occasion to say something both of the nature of “spirit” and “the vital principle,” and we shall here enter into the subject at greater length. There are three bodies — simple bodies — which seem especially entitled to receive the name, at all events, to perform the office of “spirit,” viz., fire, air, and water, each of which, by reason of its ceaseless flux and motion, expressed by the words flame, wind, and flood, appears to have the properties of life, or of some other body. Flame is the flow of fire, wind the flow of air, stream or flood the flow of water. Flame, like an animal, is self-motive, self-nutrient, self-augmentative, and is the symbol of our life. It is therefore that it is so universally brought into requisition in religious ceremonies: it was guarded by priestesses and virgins in the temples of Apollo and Vesta as a sacred thing, and from the remotest antiquity has been held worthy of divine worship by the Persians and other ancient nations; as if God were most conspicuous in flame, and spoke to us from fire as He did to Moses of old. Air is also appropriately spoken of as “spirit,” having received the title from the act of respiration. Aristotle himself admits, “that there is a kind of life, and birth, and death of the winds.”[^3] Finally, we speak of a running stream as “living water.”

These three, therefore, inasmuch as they have a kind of life, appear to act superiorly to the forces of the element, and to share in a more divine nature; they were, therefore, placed among the number of the divinities by the heathen. When any excellent work or process appeared, surpassing the powers of the naked elements, it was held as proceeding from some more divine agent. “To act with power superior to the powers of the elements,” therefore, and, on that account, “to share in the properties of some more divine thing, which does not derive its origin from the elements,” appear to have the same signification.

The blood, in like manner, “acts with powers superior to the powers of the elements” in the fact of its existence, in the forms of primordial and innate heat, in semen and spirit, and its producing all the other parts of the body in succession; proceeding at all times with such foresight and understanding, and with definite ends in view, as if it employed reasoning in its acts. Now this it does not, in so far as it is elementary, and as deriving its origin from fire, but in so far as it is possessed of plastic powers and endowed with the gift of the vegetative soul, as it is the primordial and innate heat, and the immediate and competent instrument of life. *Αἷμα, τὸ ζωτικὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου*: The blood is the living principle of man, says Suidas; and the same thing is true of all animals; an opinion which Virgil seems to have wished to express when he says:

> *Una eademque via sanguisque animusque sequuntur.*
> And by one path the blood and life flowed out.

The blood, therefore, by reason of its admirable properties and powers, is “spirit.” It is also celestial; for nature, the soul, that which answers to the essence of the stars, is the inmate of the spirit, in other words, it is something analogous to heaven, the instrument of heaven, vicarious of heaven.

In this way all natural bodies fall to be considered under a twofold point of view, viz., either as they are specially regarded, and are comprehended within the limits of their own proper nature, or are viewed as the instruments of some more noble agent and superior power. For as regards their peculiar powers, there is, perhaps, no doubt but that all things subject to generation by birth, and to death and decay, derive their origin from the elements, and perform their offices agreeably to their proper standard; but in so far as they are the instruments of a more excellent agent, and are governed by that, not acting of their own proper nature, but by the regimen of another; therefore is it, therein is it, that they seem to participate with another and more divine body, and to surpass the powers of the ordinary elements.

In the same way, too, is the blood the animal heat, in so far, namely, as it is governed in its actions by the soul; for it is celestial as subservient to heaven; and divine, because it is the instrument of God the great and good. But this we have already spoken of above, where we have shown that male and female were the instruments of the sun, heaven, and Supreme Preserver, when they served for the generation of the more perfect animals.

The inferior world, according to Aristotle, is so continuous and connected with the superior orbits, that all its motions and changes appear to take their rise and to receive direction from thence. In that world, indeed, which the Greeks called *Κόσμος* from its order and beauty, inferior and corruptible things wait upon superior and incorruptible things; but all are still subservient to the will of the supreme, omnipotent, and eternal Creator.

They, therefore, who think that nothing composed of the elements can show powers of action superior to the forces exercised by these, unless they at the same time partake of some other and more divine body, and on this ground conceive the spirits they evoke as constituted partly of the elements, partly of a certain ethereal and celestial substance — these persons, I say, appear to me to reason indifferently. In the first place you will scarcely find any elementary body which in acting does not exceed its proper powers: air and water, the winds and the ocean, when they waft navies to either India and round this globe, and often by opposite courses, when they grind, bake, dig, pump, saw timber, sustain fire, support some things, overwhelm others, and suffice for an infinite variety of other and most admirable offices — who shall say that they do not surpass the powers of the elements? In like manner what does not fire accomplish? in the kitchen, in the furnace, in the laboratory, softening, hardening, melting, subliming, changing, in an infinite variety of ways! What shall we say of it when we see iron itself produced by its agency? — iron “that breaks the stubborn soil, and shakes the earth with war!” — iron that in the magnet (to which Thales therefore ascribed a soul) attracts other iron, “subdues all other things, and seeks besides I know not what inane,” as Pliny[^4] says; for the steel needle only rubbed with the loadstone still steadily points to the great cardinal points; and when our clocks constantly indicate the hours of the day and night— shall we not admit that all of these partake of something else, and that of a more divine nature, than the elements? And if in the domain and rule of nature so many excellent operations are daily effected surpassing the powers of the things themselves, what shall we not think possible within the pale and regimen of nature, of which all art is but imitation? And if, as ministers of man, they effect such admirable ends, what, I ask, may we not expect of them, when they are instruments in the hand of God?

We must, therefore, make the distinction and say, that whilst no primary agent or prime efficient produces effects beyond its powers, every instrumental agent may exceed its own proper powers in action; for it acts not merely by its own virtue, but by the virtue of a superior efficient.

They, consequently, who refuse such remarkable faculties to the blood, and go to heaven to fetch down I know not what spirits, to which they ascribe these divine virtues, cannot know, or at all events, cannot consider that the process of generation, and even of nutrition, which indeed is a kind of generation, for the sake of which they are so lavish of admirable properties, surpasses the powers of those very spirits themselves, nor of the spirits only, but of the vegetative, aye, even the sensitive, and I will venture to add, the rational soul. Powers, did I say? It far exceeds even any estimate we can form of the rational soul; for the nature of generation, and the order that prevails in it, are truly admirable and divine, beyond all that thought can conceive or understanding comprehend.

That it may, however, more clearly appear that the remarkable virtues which the learned attribute to the spirits and the innate heat belong to the blood alone, besides what has already been spoken of as conspicuous in the egg before any trace of the embryo appears, as well as in the perfect and adult foetus, the few following observations are made by way of further illustration, and for the sake of the diligent inquirer. The blood considered absolutely and by itself, without the veins, in so far as it is an elementary fluid, and composed of several parts — of thin and serous particles, and of thick and concrete particles called cruor — possesses but few, and these not very obvious virtues. Contained within the veins, however, inasmuch as it is an integral part of the body, and is animated, regenerative, and the immediate instrument and principal seat of the soul, inasmuch, moreover, as it seems to partake of the nature of another more divine body, and is transfused by divine animal heat, it obtains remarkable and most excellent powers, and is analogous to the essence of the stars. In so far as it is spirit, it is the hearth, the Vesta, the household divinity, the innate heat, the sun of the microcosm, the fire of Plato; not because like common fire it lightens, burns, and destroys, but because by a vague and incessant motion it preserves, nourishes, and aggrandizes itself. It further deserves the name of spirit, inasmuch as it is radical moisture, at once the ultimate and the proximate and the primary aliment, more abundant than all the other parts; preparing for and administering to these the same nutriment with which itself is fed, ceaselessly permeating the whole body, cherishing and keeping alive the parts which it has fashioned and added to itself, not otherwise assuredly than the superior stars, the sun and moon especially, in maintaining their own proper orbits, continually vivify the stars that are beneath them.

Since the blood acts, then, with forces superior to the forces of the elements, and exerts its influence through these forces or virtues, and is the instrument of the Great Workman, no one can ever sufficiently extol its admirable, its divine faculties. In the first place, and especially, it is possessed by a soul which is not only vegetative, but sensitive and motive also; it penetrates everywhere and is ubiquitous; abstracted, the soul or the life too is gone, so that the blood does not seem to differ in any respect from the soul or the life itself (*anima*); at all events, it is to be regarded as the substance whose act is the soul or the life. Such, I say, is the soul, which is neither wholly corporeal nor yet wholly incorporeal; which is derived in part from abroad, and is partly produced at home; which in one way is part of the body, but in another way is the beginning and cause of all that is contained in the animal body, viz., nutrition, sense, and motion, and consequently of life and of death alike; for whatever is nourished, is itself vivified, and vice versa. In like manner, that which is abundantly nourished increases; what is not sufficiently supplied shrinks; what is perfectly nourished preserves its health; what is not perfectly nourished falls into disease. The blood, therefore, even as the soul, is to be regarded as the cause and author of youth and old age, of sleep and waking, and also of respiration; all the more and especially as the first instrument in natural things contains the internal moving cause within itself. It therefore comes to the same thing, whether we say that the soul and the blood, or the blood with the soul, or the soul with the blood, performs all the acts in the animal organism.

We are too much in the habit, neglecting things, of worshipping specious names. The word blood, signifying a substance, which we have before our eyes, and can touch, has nothing of grandiloquence about it; but before such titles as spirits, and *calidum innatum* or innate heat, we stand agape. But the mask removed, as the error disappears, so does the idle admiration. The celebrated stone, so much vaunted for its virtues by Pipinus and Migaldus, seems to have filled not only them but also Thuanus, an excellent historian, with wonder and admiration. Let me be allowed to append the riddle: “Lately,” says he, “there was brought from the East Indies to our king a stone, which we have seen, wonderfully radiant with light and effulgence, the whole of which, as if burning and in flames, was resplendent with an incredible brilliancy of light. Tossed hither and thither, it filled the ambient air with beams that were scarcely bearable by any eyes. It was also extremely impatient of the earth; if you essayed to cover it, it forthwith and of itself burst forth with violence, and mounted on high. No man could by any art contain or inclose it in any confined place; on the contrary, it appears to delight in free and spacious places. It is of the highest purity, of the greatest brightness, and is without stain or blemish. It has no certain shape, but a shape uncertain and changing every moment. Of the most consummate beauty, it suffers no one to touch it; and if you persist too long or obstinately, it will do you injury, as I have observed it repeatedly to do in no trifling measure. If anything be by chance taken from it by persevering efforts, it is (strange to say) made nothing less thereby. Its custodier adds further, that its virtues and powers are useful in a great variety of ways, and even — especially to kings — indispensably necessary; but these he declines to reveal without being first paid a large reward.” The author might have added of this stone that it was neither hard nor soft, and exhibited a variety of forms and colours, and had a singular trick of trembling and palpitating, and like an animal — although itself inanimate — consumed a large quantity of food every day for its nutrition or sustenance. Further, that he had heard from men worthy of credit, that this stone had formerly fallen from heaven to earth; that it was the frequent cause of thunder and lightning, and was still occasionally engendered from the solar beams refracted through water.

Who would not admire so remarkable a stone, or believe that it acted with a force superior to the forces of the elements, that it participated in the nature of another body, and possessed an ethereal spirit? especially when he found that it responded in its proportions to the essence of the sun. But with Fernelius[^5] for *Œdipus*, we find the whole enigma resolving itself into “Flame.”

In the same way, did I paint the blood under the garb of a fable, and gave it the title of the philosopher’s stone, and propose all its wonderful faculties and operations in enigmatical language, many would doubtless think a great deal of it; they would readily believe that it could act with powers superior to those of the elements, and they would not unwillingly allow it to be possessed of another and more divine body.

## Exercise 72: Of the Primigenial Moisture

We have now dignified the blood with the title of the innate heat; with like propriety, we believe, that the fluid which we have called the crystalline colliquament, from which the foetus and its parts primarily and immediately arise, may be designated the radical and primigenial moisture. There is certainly nothing in the generation of animals to which this title can with better right be given.

We call this the radical moisture, because from it arises the first particle of the embryo, the blood, to wit; and all the other posthumous parts arise from it as from a root; and they are procreated and nourished, and grow and are preserved by the same matter.

We also call it primigenial, because it is first engendered in every animal organism, and is, as it were, the foundation of the rest, as may be seen in the egg, in which it presents itself after a brief period of incubation, as the first work of the inherent fecundity and reproductive power.

This fluid is also the most simple, pure, and unadulterated body, in which all the parts of the pullet are present potentially, though none of them are there actually. It appears that nature has conceded to it the same qualities which are usually ascribed to first matter common to all things, viz., that potentially it be capable of assuming all forms, but have itself no form in fact. So the crystalline humour of the eye, in order that it might be susceptible of all colours, is itself colourless; and in like manner are the media or organs of each of the senses destitute of all the other qualities of sensible things: the organs of smelling and hearing, and the air which ministers to them, are without smell and sound; the saliva of the tongue and mouth is also tasteless.

And it is upon this argument that they mainly rely who maintain the possibility of an incorporeal intellect, viz., because it is susceptible of all forms without matter; and as the hand is called the “instrument of instruments,” so is the intellect called “the form of forms,” being itself immaterial and wholly without form; it is, therefore, said to be possible or potential, but not passible.

This fluid, or one analogous to it, appears also to be the ultimate aliment from which Aristotle taught that the semen, or geniture, as he calls it, is produced.[^6] I say the ultimate aliment, called dew by the Arabians, with which all the parts of the body are bathed and moistened. For in the same way as this dew, by ulterior condensation and adhesion, becomes alible gluten and cambium, whence the parts of the body are constituted, so, *mutatis mutandis*, in the commencement of generation and nutrition, from gluten liquefied and rendered thinner is formed the nutritious dew: from the white of the egg is produced the colliquament under discussion, the radical moisture and primigenial dew. The thing indeed is identical in either instance, if any credit be accorded to our observations; and in fact neither philosophers nor physicians deny that an animal is nourished by the same matter out of which it is formed, and is increased by that from which it was engendered. The nutritious dew, therefore, differs from the colliquament or primigenial moisture only in the relation of prior and posterior; the one is concocted and prepared by the parents, the other by the embryo itself, both juices, however, being the proximate and immediate aliment of animals; not indeed “first and second,” according to that dictum, *contraria ex contrariis*, but ultimate, as I have said, and as Aristotle himself admonishes us, according to that other dictum, *similia ex similibus augeri*, “like is necessarily increased by its like.” There is in either fluid a proximate force, in virtue of which, no obstacles intervening, it will pass spontaneously, or by the law of nature, into every part of the animal body.

Such being the state of the question, it is obvious that all controversy about the matter of animals and their nourishment may be settled without difficulty. For as some believe that the semen or matter emitted in intercourse is taken up from every part of the body, so do they derive from this the resemblance of the offspring to the parents. Aristotle has these words: “Against the opinion of the ancients, it may be said that as they avow the semen to be a derivative from all parts else, we believe the semen to be disposed of itself to form part; and whilst they call it a colliquament, we are rather inclined to regard it as an excrement” (he had, however, said shortly before that he entitled excrement the remains of the nourishment, and colliquament that which is secreted from the growth by a preternatural resolution); “for that which arrives last, and is the excrement of what is final, is in all probability of the same nature; in the same way as painters have very commonly some remains of colours, which are identical with those they have applied upon their canvas; but anything that is consuming and melting away is corrupt and degenerate. Another argument that the seminal fluid is not a colliquament, but an excrement, is this: that animals of larger growth are less prolific, smaller creatures more fruitful. Now there must be a larger quantity of colliquament in larger than in smaller animals, but less excrement; for as there must be a large consumption of nourishment in a large body, so must there be a small production of excrement. Further, there is no place provided by nature for receiving and storing colliquament; it flows off by the way that is most open to it; but there are receptacles for all the natural excrements — the bowels for the dry excrements, the bladder for the moist; the stomach for matters useful; the genital organs, the uterus, the mammae for seminal matter— in which several places they collect and run together.” After this he goes on by a variety of arguments to prove that the seminal matter from which the foetus is formed is the same as that which is prepared for the nutrition of the parts at large. As if, should one require some pigment from a painter, he certainly would not go to scrape off what he had already laid on his canvas, but would supply the demand from his store, or from what he had over from his work, which was still of the same nature as that which he might have taken away from his picture. So and in like manner the excrement of the ultimate nutriment, or the remainder of the gluten and dew, is carried to the genital organs and there deposited; and this view is most accordant with the production of eggs by the hen.

The medical writers, too, who hold all the parts to be originally formed from the spermatic fluid, and consequently speak of these under the name of spermatic parts, say that the semen is formed from the ultimate nourishment, which with Aristotle they believe to be the blood,

being produced by the virtue of the genital organs, and constituting the “matter” of the foetus. Now it is obvious enough that the egg is produced by the mother and her ultimate nutriment, the nutritious dew, to wit. That clear part of the egg, therefore, that primigenial, or rather antegenial colliquament, is more truly to be reputed the semen of the cock, although it is not projected in the act of intercourse, but is prepared before intercourse, or is gathered together after this, as happens in many animals, and as will perhaps be stated more at length by and by, because the geniture of the male, according to Aristotle, coagulates.

When I see, therefore, all the parts formed and increasing from this one moisture, as “matter,” and from a primitive root, and the reasons already given combine in persuading us that this ought to be so, I can scarcely refrain from taunting and pushing to extremity the followers of Empedocles and Hippocrates, who believed all similar bodies to be engendered as mixtures by association of the four contrary elements, and to become corrupted by their disjunction; nor should I less spare Democritus and the Epicurean school that succeeded him, who compose all things of congregations of atoms of diverse figure. Because it was an error of theirs in former times, as it is a vulgar error at the present day, to believe that all similar bodies are engendered from diverse or heterogeneous matters. For on this footing, nothing even to the lynx’s eye would be similar, one, the same, and continuous; the unity would be apparent only, a kind of congeries or heap — a congregation or collection of extremely small bodies; nor would generation differ in any respect from an aggregation and arrangement of particles.

But neither in the production of animals, nor in the generation of any other “similar” body (whether it were of animal parts, or of plants, stones, minerals, &c.), have I ever been able to observe any congregation of such a kind, or any divers miscibles pre-existing for union in the work of reproduction. For neither, in so far at least as I have had power to perceive, or as reason will carry me, have I ever been able to trace any “similar” parts, such as membranes, flesh, fibres, cartilage, bone, &c., produced in such order, or as co-existent, that from these, as the elements of animal bodies, conjoined organs or limbs, and finally, the entire animal, should be compounded. But, as has been already said, the first rudiment of the body is a mere homogeneous and pulpy jelly, not unlike a concrete mass of spermatic fluid; and from this, under the law of generation, altered, and at the same time split or multifariously divided, as by a divine fiat, from an inorganic, an organic mass results; this is made bone, this muscle or nerve, this a receptacle for excrementitious matter, &c.; from a similar, a dissimilar is produced; out of one thing of the same nature several of diverse and contrary natures; and all this by no transposition or local movement, as a congregation of similar particles, or a separation of heterogeneous particles is effected under the influence of heat, but rather by the segregation of homogeneous than the union of heterogeneous particles.

And I believe that the same thing takes place in all generation, so that similar bodies have no mixed elements prior to themselves, but rather exist before their elements (these, according to Empedocles and Aristotle, being fire, air, earth, and water; according to chemists, salt, sulphur, and mercury; according to Democritus, certain atoms), as being naturally more perfect than these. There are, I say, both mixed and compound bodies prior to any of the so called elements, into which they are resolved, or in which they end. They are resolved, namely, into these elements according to reason rather than in fact. The so-called elements, therefore, are not prior to those things that are engendered, or that originate, but are posterior rather — they are relics or remainders rather than principles. Neither Aristotle himself nor anyone else has ever demonstrated the separate existence of the elements in the nature of things, or that they were the principles of “similar” bodies.

The philosopher, [^1] indeed, when he proceeds to prove that there are elements, still seems uncertain whether the conclusion ought to be that they exist in *esse*, or only in *posse*; he is of opinion that in natural things they are present in power rather than in action; and therefore does he assert, from the division, separation, and solution of things, that there are elements. It is, however, an argument of no great cogency to say that natural bodies are primarily produced or composed of those things into which they are ultimately resolved; for upon this principle some things would come out composed of glass, ashes, and smoke, into which we see them finally reduced by fire; and as artificial distillation clearly shows that a great variety of vapours and waters of different species can be drawn from so many different bodies, the number of elements would have to be increased to infinity. Nor has any one among the philosophers said that the bodies which, dissolved by art, are held pure and indivisible in their species, are elements of greater simplicity than the air, water, and earth, which we perceive by our senses, which we are familiar with through our eyes.

Nor, to conclude, do we see aught in the shape of miscible matter naturally engendered from fire; and it is perhaps impossible that it should be so, since fire, like that which is alive, is in a perpetual state of fluxion, and seeks for food by which it may be nourished and kept in being; in conformity with the words of Aristotle, that “Fire is only nourished, and is especially remarkable in this.” [^2] But what is nourished cannot itself be mingled with its nutriment. Whence it follows that it is impossible fire should be miscible. For mixture, according to Aristotle, is the union of altered miscibles, in which one thing is not transformed into another, but two things, severally active and passive, into a third thing. Generation, however, especially generation by metamorphosis, is the distribution of one similar thing having undergone change into several others. Nor are mixed similar bodies said to be generated from the elements, but to be constituted by them in some certain way, solvent forces residing in them at the same time.

These considerations, however, properly belong to the section of Physiology, which treats of the elements and temperaments, where it will be our business to speak of them more at large.
