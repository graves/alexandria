# Volume 28 - Gilbert, Galileo, Harvey

Three foundational works of the Scientific Revolution, establishing experimental methods and transforming our understanding of magnetism, mechanics, and the human body.

## WILLIAM GILBERT (1544-1603)

English physician and natural philosopher who pioneered the experimental study of magnetism and electricity.

- **On the Loadstone and Magnetic Bodies** - The first great work of experimental physics, systematically investigating magnetic phenomena. Gilbert proposed that the Earth itself is a giant magnet and introduced the concept of "electric" attraction.

## GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642)

Italian astronomer, physicist, and mathematician, Galileo is the father of modern observational astronomy and modern physics.

- **Dialogues Concerning the Two New Sciences** - Galileo's final and greatest scientific work, founding the modern sciences of materials and kinematics. Presented as a dialogue, it establishes the laws of falling bodies and projectile motion.

## WILLIAM HARVEY (1578-1657)

English physician who discovered the circulation of the blood, overturning ancient medical doctrine.

- **On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals** - The revolutionary demonstration that blood circulates continuously through the body, pumped by the heart through arteries and returning through veins.

- **On the Circulation of the Blood** - A defense and elaboration of Harvey's circulatory theory against critics.

- **On the Generation of Animals** - Harvey's studies on embryology and reproduction.
