### Works in This Volume

- **The Brothers Karamazov** - Dostoevsky's final novel and crowning achievement, a murder mystery that becomes a profound exploration of faith, doubt, morality, and free will. The novel follows the Karamazov family—the dissolute father Fyodor and his three sons: the intellectual skeptic Ivan, the passionate Dmitri, and the saintly Alyosha. The "Legend of the Grand Inquisitor," recounted by Ivan, is one of the most famous passages in all literature.
