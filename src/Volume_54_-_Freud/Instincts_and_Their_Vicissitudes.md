# Instincts and Their Vicissitudes

Our work of description and classification if we replace it by another. The occasion for it arose in the course of the evolution of *psychoanalysis*, which was first employed upon the *psychoneuroses*, actually upon the group designated *transference neuroses* (*hysteria* and *obsessional neurosis*); through them it became plain that at the root of all such affections there lies a conflict between the claims of *sexuality* and those of the *ego*. It is always possible that an exhaustive study of the other neurotic affections (especially of the *narcissistic psychoneuroses*, the *schizophrenias*) may oblige us to alter this formula and therewith to make a different classification of the primal *instincts*. But for the present we do not know what this new formula may be, nor have we met with any argument which seems likely to be prejudicial to the contrast between *sexual* and *ego-instincts*.

I am altogether doubtful whether work upon psychological material will afford any decisive indication for the distinction and classification of *instincts*. Rather it would seem necessary to apply to this material certain definite assumptions in order to work upon it, and we could wish that these assumptions might be taken from some other branch of knowledge and transferred to psychology. The contribution of biology on this point certainly does not run counter to the distinction between *sexual* and *ego-instincts*. Biology teaches that *sexuality* is not on a level with the other functions of the individual, for its purposes go beyond the individual, their content being the production of new individuals and the preservation of the species. It shows, further, that the relation existing between the *ego* and *sexuality* may be conceived of in two ways, apparently equally well justified: in the one, the individual is regarded as of prime importance, *sexuality* as one of his activities and sexual satisfaction as one of his needs; while in the other, the individual organism is looked upon as a transitory and perishable appendage to the quasi-immortal *germ-plasm* bequeathed to him by the race. The assumption that the sexual function differs from other bodily processes in virtue of special chemical processes is, I understand, also a postulate of the Ehrlich school of biological research.

Since a study of the *instincts* from the side of consciousness presents almost insuperable difficulties, *psycho-analytic* investigation of mental disturbances remains the principal source of our knowledge. The development of this line of investigation, however, has necessarily produced hitherto information of a more or less definite nature only in regard to the *sexual instincts*, for it is this group in particular which can be observed in isolation, as it were, in the *psychoneuroses*. With the extension of *psycho-analysis* to other neurotic affections we may be sure that we shall find a basis for our knowledge of the *ego-instincts* also, though it would be optimistic to expect equally favourable conditions for observation in this further field of research.

An attempt to formulate the general characteristics of the *sexual instincts* would run as follows: they are numerous, emanate from manifold organic sources, act in the first instance independently of one another and only at a late stage achieve a more or less complete *synthesis*. The aim which each strives to attain is *organ-pleasure*; only when the *synthesis* is complete do they enter the service of the function of reproduction, becoming thereby generally recognizable as *sexual instincts*. At their first appearance, they support themselves upon the *instincts of self-preservation*, from which they only gradually detach themselves; in their choice of object, also, they follow paths indicated by the *ego-instincts*. Some of them remain throughout life associated with these latter and furnish them with *libidinal components*, which with normal functioning easily escape notice and are clearly recognizable only when disease is present. They have this distinctive characteristic—that they have in a high degree the capacity to act vicariously for one another and that they can readily change their objects. In consequence of the last-mentioned properties they are capable of activities widely removed from their original modes of attaining their aims (*sublimation*).

Our inquiry into the various *vicissitudes* which *instincts* undergo in the process of development and in the course of life must be confined to the *sexual instincts*, for these are the more familiar to us. Observation shows us that an *instinct* may undergo the following *vicissitudes*:

-   *Reversal into its opposite*
-   *Turning round upon the subject*
-   *Repression*
-   *Sublimation*

Since I do not intend to treat of *sublimation* here, and since *repression* requires a special chapter to itself, it only remains for us to describe and discuss the first two points. Bearing in mind that there are tendencies which are opposed to the *instincts* pursuing a straightforward course, we may regard these *vicissitudes* as modes of defence against the *instincts*.

The *reversal of an instinct into its opposite* may on closer scrutiny be resolved into two different processes: a change from *active* to *passive*, and a *reversal of the content*. The two processes, being essentially distinct, must be treated separately.

Examples of the first process are met with in the two pairs of opposites: *sadism-masochism* and *scoptophilia-exhibitionism*. The reversal here concerns only the aims of the *instincts*. The *passive* aim (to be tortured, or looked at) has been substituted for the *active* aim (to torture, to look at). *Reversal of content* is found in the single instance of the change of *love* into *hate*.

The *turning round of an instinct upon the subject* is suggested to us by the reflection that *masochism* is actually *sadism* turned round upon the subject’s own *ego*, and that *exhibitionism* includes the love of gazing at the subject’s own body. Further, analytic observation leaves us in no doubt that the *masochist* also enjoys the act of torturing when this is being applied to himself, and the *exhibitionist* the exposing of someone in being exposed himself. So the essence of the process is the change of the object, while the aim remains unchanged.

We cannot fail to note, however, that in these examples *turning round upon the subject’s self* and *transformation from active to passive* coincide or occur in one process. To elucidate the relation between the two processes, a more thorough investigation must be undertaken.

With the pair of opposites *sadism-masochism*, the process may be represented as follows:

(a) *Sadism* consists in the exercise of violence or power upon some other person as its object.
(b) This object is abandoned and replaced by the subject’s self. Together with the *turning round upon the self*, the change from an *active* to a *passive* aim in the *instinct* is also brought about.
(c) Again another person is sought as object; this person, in consequence of the alteration which has taken place in the aim of the *instinct*, has to take over the original role of the subject.

Case (c) is the condition commonly termed *masochism*. Satisfaction follows in this case also by way of the original *sadism*, the *passive ego* placing itself in *phantasy* back in its former situation, which, however, has now been given up to another subject outside the self. Whether there is, besides this, a more direct *masochistic* satisfaction is highly doubtful. A primary *masochism* not derived in the manner I have described from *sadism*, does not appear to be met with. [^1] That it is not superfluous to make the assumption of stage (b) is quite clear when we observe the behaviour of the *sadistic impulse* in cases of *obsessional neurosis*. In these we have the *turning upon the subject’s self*, without the attitude of *passivity* towards another: the reversal has only reached the second stage. Self-torment and self-punishment have arisen from the desire to torture, but not *masochism*. The *active* voice is changed, not into the *passive*, but into the *reflexive middle voice*.

The conception of *sadism* is made more complicated by the circumstance that this *instinct*, side by side with its general aim (or perhaps rather, within it), seems to press towards a quite special aim: the infliction of pain, in addition to subjection and mastery of the object. Now *psycho-analysis* would seem to show that the infliction of pain plays no part in the original aims sought by the *instinct*: the *sadistic* child takes no notice of whether or not it inflicts pain, nor is it part of its purpose to do so. But when once the transformation into *masochism* has taken place, the experience of pain is very well adapted to serve as a *passive masochistic* aim, for we have every reason to believe that sensations of pain, like other unpleasant sensations, extend into *sexual excitation* and produce a condition which is pleasurable, for the sake of which the subject will even willingly experience the unpleasantness of pain. Where once the suffering of pain has been experienced as a *masochistic* aim, it can be carried back into the *sadistic* situation and result in a *sadistic* aim of inflicting pain, which will then be *masochistically* enjoyed by the subject while inflicting pain upon others through his identification of himself with the suffering object. Of course, in either case it is not the pain itself which is enjoyed, but the accompanying *sexual excitement*, and this is especially easy for the *sadist*. The enjoyment of pain would thus be a primary *masochistic* aim, which, however, can then also become the aim of the originally *sadistic instinct*.

In order to complete my exposition, I would add that pity cannot be described as a result of the reversal of the *sadistic instinct*, but necessitates the conception of a *reaction-formation* against that *instinct* (for the difference, see below).

Rather different and simpler results are afforded by the investigation of another pair of opposites, namely, those *instincts* whose aim is *sexual gazing* (*scoptophilia*) and *self-display* (the *voyeur* and *exhibitionist tendencies*, as they are called, in the language of the *perversions*). Here again we may postulate the same stages as in the previous instance: (a) *scoptophilia* as an activity directed towards an extraneous object; (b) abandonment of the object and a turning of the *scoptophilic instinct* towards a part of the subject’s own person; therewith a transformation to *passivity* and the setting up of a new aim—that of being looked at; (c) the institution of a new subject to whom one displays oneself in order to be looked at. Here too, it is hardly possible to doubt that the *active* aim appears before the *passive*, that *scoptophilia* precedes *exhibitionism*. But there is an important divergence from what happens in the case of *sadism*, in that we can recognize in the *scoptophilic instinct* a yet earlier stage than that described as (a). That is to say, that at the beginning of its activity the *scoptophilic instinct* is *auto-erotic*: it has indeed an object, but that object is the subject’s own body. It is only later that the *instinct* comes (by way of comparison) to exchange this object for the analogous one of the body of another (stage (a)). Now this preliminary stage is interesting because it is the source of both the situations represented in the resulting pair of opposites, according to which element in the original situation is reversed. The following might serve as a scheme for the *scoptophilic instinct*:

1.  Subject’s looking at his own sexual organ.
2.  Subject’s own sexual organ being looked at by himself.
3.  Subject’s looking at an extraneous object (*active scoptophilia*).
4.  Subject’s own sexual organ being looked at by another person (*exhibitionism*).

A preliminary stage of this kind is absent in *sadism*, which from the outset is directed upon an extraneous object, although it might not be altogether unreasonable to regard as such a stage the child’s efforts to gain control of his limbs. [^2]

With regard to both these *instincts* just examined as examples, it must be said that transformation of them by a reversal from *active* to *passive*, and by a *turning round upon the subject*, never in fact concerns the whole amount of impelling force pertaining to the *instinct*. To some extent its earlier *active* direction always persists side by side with the later *passive* direction, even when the transformation is very extensive. The only correct description of the *scoptophilic instinct* would be that all phases of its development, the *auto-erotic*, preliminary phase as well as its final *active* or *passive* form, co-exist alongside one another; and the truth of this statement becomes manifest if we base our opinion, not upon the actions which are prompted by the *instinct*, but upon the mechanism of its satisfaction. Perhaps yet another way of conceiving and representing the matter may be justified. We may split up the life of each *instinct* into a series of thrusts, distinct from one another in the time of their occurrence, but each homogeneous within its own period, whose relation to one another is comparable to that of successive eruptions of lava. We can then perhaps picture to ourselves that the earliest and most primitive *instinct-eruption* persists in an unchanged form and undergoes no development at all. The next thrust would then from the outset have undergone a change of form, being turned, for instance, from *active* to *passive*, and it would then, with this new characteristic, be superimposed upon the earlier layer, and so on. So that, if we take a survey of the *instinctual tendency* from its beginning up to any given stopping-point, the succession of thrusts which we have described would present the picture of a definite development of the *instinct*.

The fact that, at that later period of development, the *instinct* in its primary form may be observed side by side with its (*passive*) opposite deserves to be distinguished by the highly appropriate name introduced by Bleuler: *ambivalence*.

These considerations regarding the developmental history of an *instinct* and the permanent character of the intermediate stages in it should make *instinct-development* more comprehensible to us. Experience shows that the degree of demonstrable *ambivalence* varies greatly in individuals, groups, and races. Marked *ambivalence* of an *instinct* in a human being at the present day may be regarded as an archaic inheritance, for we have reason to suppose that the part played in the life of the *instincts* by the *active impulses*, in their primary form, was greater in primitive times than it is on an average today.

We have become accustomed to call the early phase of the development of the *ego*, during which its *sexual instincts* find *auto-erotic* satisfaction, *narcissism*, without having so far entered into any discussion of the relation between *auto-erotism* and *narcissism*. It follows that, in considering the preliminary phase of the *scoptophilic instinct*, when the subject’s own body is the object of the *scoptophilia*, we must place it under the heading of *narcissism*; it is a *narcissistic formation*. From this phase the *active scoptophilic instinct*, which has left *narcissism* behind, is developed, while the *passive scoptophilic instinct*, on the contrary, holds fast to the *narcissistic object*. Similarly, the transformation from *sadism* to *masochism* betokens a reversion to the *narcissistic object*, while in both cases the *narcissistic* (*active*) subject is exchanged by identification for another, extraneous *ego*. Taking into consideration the preliminary *narcissistic* stage of *sadism* constructed by us, we approach the more general view that those *vicissitudes* which consist in the *instinct* being *turned round upon the subject’s own ego* and undergoing *reversal from activity to passivity* are dependent upon the *narcissistic organization* of the *ego* and bear the stamp of that phase. Perhaps they represent attempts at *defence* which at higher stages of the development of the *ego* are effected by other means.

At this point we may remember that so far we have discussed only two pairs of *instincts* and their opposites: *sadism-masochism* and *scoptophilia-exhibitionism*. These are the best-known *sexual instincts* which appear in ambivalent forms. The other components of the later *sexual function* are at present too inaccessible to analysis for us to be able to discuss them in a similar way. In general we can assert of them that their activities are *auto-erotic*, i.e., their object becomes negligible in comparison with the organ which is their source, and as a rule the two coincide. The object of the *scoptophilic instinct*, although it also in the first instance is a part of the subject’s own body, nevertheless is not the eye itself; and with *sadism* the organic source, probably the musculature with its capacity for action, directly presupposes an object other than itself, even though that object be part of the subject’s own body. In the *auto-erotic instincts*, the part played by the organic source is so decisive that, according to a plausible supposition of P. Federn and L. Jekels, [^3] the form and function of the organ determine the *activity* or *passivity* of the *instinct’s* aim.

The *transformation of the content of an instinct into its opposite* is observed in a single instance only—the changing of *love* into *hate*. It is particularly common to find both these directed simultaneously towards the same object, and this phenomenon of their co-existence furnishes the most important example of *ambivalence* of feeling.

The case of *love* and *hate* acquires a special interest from the circumstance that it resists classification in our scheme of the *instincts*. It is impossible to doubt the existence of a most intimate relation between these two contrary feelings and *sexual life*, but one is naturally unwilling to conceive of *love* as being a kind of special *component-instinct* of *sexuality* in the same way as are the others just discussed. One would prefer to regard *loving* rather as the expression of the whole *sexual current of feeling*, but this idea does not clear up our difficulties and we are at a loss how to conceive of an essential opposite to this striving.

*Loving* admits of not merely one, but of three antitheses. First there is the antithesis of *loving*—*hating*; secondly, there is *loving*—*being loved*; and, in addition to these, *loving* and *hating* together are the opposite of the condition of *neutrality* or *indifference*. The second of these two antitheses, *loving*—*being loved*, corresponds exactly to the *transformation from active to passive* and may be traced to a primal situation in the same way as the *scoptophilic instinct*. This situation is that of *loving oneself*, which for us is the characteristic of *narcissism*. Then, according to whether the self as object or subject is exchanged or an extraneous one, there results the *active* aim of *loving* or the *passive* one of *being loved*, the latter remaining nearly related to *narcissism*.

Perhaps we shall come to a better understanding of the manifold opposites of *loving* if we reflect that our mental life as a whole is governed by three polarities, namely, the following antitheses:

-   *Subject* (*ego*)—*Object* (external world)
-   *Pleasure*—*Pain*
-   *Active*—*Passive*

The antithesis of *ego*—*non-ego* (outer), i.e., *subject*—*object*, is, as we have already said, thrust upon the individual being at an early stage, by the experience that it can abolish external stimuli by means of muscular action but is defenceless against those stimuli that originate in *instinct*. This antithesis remains sovereign above all in our intellectual activity and provides research with a fundamental situation which no amount of effort can alter. The polarity of *pleasure*—*pain* depends upon a feeling-series, the significance of which in determining our actions (*will*) is paramount and has already been emphasized. The antithesis of *active* and *passive* must not be confounded with that of *ego-subject*—*external object*. The relation of the *ego* to the outer world is *passive* in so far as it receives stimuli from it, *active* when it reacts to these. Its *instincts* compel it to a quite special degree of *activity* towards the outside world, so that, if we wished to emphasize the essence of the matter, we might say that the *ego-subject* is *passive* in respect of external stimuli, *active* in virtue of its own *instincts*. The antithesis of *active*—*passive* coalesces later with that of *masculine*—*feminine*, which, until this has taken place, has no psychological significance. The fusion of *activity* with *masculinity* and *passivity* with *femininity* confronts us, indeed, as a biological fact, but it is by no means so invariably complete and exclusive as we are inclined to assume.

The three polarities within the mind are connected with one another in various highly significant ways. There is a certain primal psychic situation in which two of them coincide. Originally, at the very beginning of mental life, the *ego’s instincts* are directed to itself and it is to some extent capable of deriving satisfaction for them on itself. This condition is known as *narcissism*, and this potentiality for satisfaction is termed *auto-erotic*. [^4] The outside world is at this time, generally speaking, not *cathected* with any interest and is *indifferent* for purposes of satisfaction. At this period, therefore, the *ego-subject* coincides with what is *pleasurable* and the outside world with what is *indifferent* (or even *painful*, as being a source of stimulation). Let us for the moment define *loving* as the relation of the *ego* to its sources of *pleasure*: then the situation in which the *ego* loves itself only and is *indifferent* to the outside world illustrates the first of the polarities in which *loving* appeared.

In so far as it is *auto-erotic*, the *ego* has no need of the outside world, but, in consequence of experiences undergone by the *instincts of self-preservation*, it tends to find objects there and doubtless it cannot but for a time perceive inner *instinctual stimuli* as *painful*. Under the sway of the *pleasure-principle*, there now takes place a further development. The objects presenting themselves, in so far as they are sources of *pleasure*, are absorbed by the *ego* into itself, *introjected* (according to an expression coined by Ferenczi); while, on the other hand, the *ego* thrusts forth upon the external world whatever within itself gives rise to *pain* (see below: the mechanism of *projection*).

Thus the original *reality-ego*, which distinguished outer and inner by means of a sound objective criterion, changes into a purified *pleasure-ego*, which prizes above all else the quality of *pleasure*. For this *pleasure-ego*, the outside world is divided into a part that is *pleasurable*, which it has incorporated into itself, and a remainder that is alien to it. A part of itself it has separated off, and this it projects into the external world and regards as hostile. According to this new arrangement, the congruence of the two polarities,

-   *ego-subject* with *pleasure*,
-   outside world with *pain* (or earlier with *neutrality*),

is once more established.

When the stage of primary *narcissism* is invaded by the object, the second contrary attitude to that of *love*, namely, *hate*, attains to development.

As we have heard, the *ego’s* objects are presented to it from the outside world in the first instance by the *instincts of self-preservation*, and it is undeniable also that *hate* originally betokens the relation of the *ego* to the alien external world with its afflux of stimuli. *Neutrality* may be classified as a special case of *hate* or rejection, after having made its appearance first as the forerunner of *hate*. Thus at the very beginning, the external world, objects and that which was *hated* were one and the same thing. When later on an object manifests itself as a source of *pleasure*, it becomes *loved*, but also incorporated into the *ego*, so that for the purified *pleasure-ego* the object once again coincides with what is extraneous and *hated*.

Now, however, we note that just as the antithesis *love*—*indifference* reflects the polarity *ego*—external world, so the second antithesis *love*—*hate*, reproduces the polarity *pleasure*—*pain*, which is bound up with the former. When the purely *narcissistic* stage gives place to the *object-stage*, *pleasure* and *pain* denote the relations of the *ego* to the object. When the object becomes a source of *pleasurable* feelings, a motor tendency is set up which strives to bring the object near to and incorporate it into the *ego*; we then speak of the attraction exercised by the *pleasure-giving object*, and say that we *love* that object. Conversely, when the object is the source of *painful* feelings, there is a tendency which endeavours to increase the distance between object and *ego* and to repeat in relation to the former the primordial attempt at flight from the external world with its flow of stimuli. We feel a *repulsion* from the object; and *hate* it; this *hate* can then be intensified to the point of an aggressive tendency towards the object, with the intention of destroying it.

We might at a pinch say of an *instinct* that it *loves* the objects after which it strives for purposes of satisfaction, but to say that it *hates* an object strikes us as odd; so we become aware that the attitudes of *love* and *hate* cannot be said to characterize the relations of *instincts* to their objects, but are reserved for the relations of the *ego* as a whole to objects. But, if we consider a colloquial usage which is certainly full of meaning, we see that there is yet another limitation to the significance of *love* and *hate*. We do not say of those objects which serve the interests of *self-preservation* that we *love* them; rather we emphasize the fact that we heed them, and perhaps add an element of a different kind in our relation to them by words which denote a much lesser degree of *love*—for example, to be *fond of*, to *like*, to *find agreeable*.

So the word *love* becomes shifted ever further into the sphere of the pure *pleasure-relation* existing between the *ego* and its object and finally attaches itself to *sexual objects* in

[^4]: Some of the *sexual instincts* are, as we know, capable of this *auto-erotic* satisfaction and so are adapted to be the channel for that development under the sway of the *pleasure-principle* which we shall describe later. The *sexual instincts*, which from the outset require an object, and the needs of the *ego-instincts*, which are never capable of *auto-erotic* satisfaction, interfere, of course, with this condition and prepare the way for progress. More, the primal *narcissistic* condition would not have been able to attain such a development were it not that every individual goes through a period of helplessness and dependence on fostering care, during which his urgent needs are satisfied by agencies outside himself and thereby withheld from developing along their own line.

the narrower sense and to those which satisfy the needs of sublimated sexual instincts. The discrimination of the ego-instincts from the sexual, a discrimination which we have imposed upon our psychology, is seen, therefore, to be in conformity with the spirit of our speech. Since we do not customarily say that the single sexual component-instinct loves its object, but see the most appropriate case in which to apply the word love in the relation of the ego to its sexual object, we learn from this fact that the applicability of the word in this relation begins only with the synthesis of all the component-instincts under the primacy of the genitals and in the service of the function of reproduction.

It is noteworthy that in the use of the word hate no such intimate relation to sexual pleasure and the sexual function appears; on the contrary, the painful character of the relation seems to be the sole decisive feature. The ego hates, abhors, and pursues with intent to destroy all objects which are for it a source of painful feelings, without taking into account whether they mean to it frustration of sexual satisfaction or of gratification of the needs of self-preservation. Indeed, it may be asserted that the true prototypes of the hate-relation are derived not from sexual life, but from the struggle of the ego for self-preservation and self-maintenance.

So we see that love and hate, which present themselves to us as essentially antithetical, stand in no simple relation to each other. They did not originate in a cleavage of any common primal element, but sprang from different sources and underwent each its own development before the influence of the pleasure-pain relation constituted them antitheses to each other. At this point we are confronted with the task of putting together what we know of the genesis of love and hate.

Love originates in the capacity of the ego to satisfy some of its instincts auto-erotically through the obtaining of organ-pleasure. It is primarily narcissistic, is then transferred to those objects which have been incorporated in the ego, now much extended, and expresses the motor striving of the ego after these objects as sources of pleasure. It is intimately connected with the activity of the later sexual instincts and, when these have been completely synthesized, coincides with the sexual trend as a whole. The preliminary stages of love reveal themselves as temporary sexual aims, while the sexual instincts are passing through their complicated development. First amongst these we recognize the phase of incorporating or devouring, a type of love which is compatible with abolition of any separate existence on the part of the object, and which may therefore be designated ambivalent. At the higher stage of the pre-genital sadistic-anal organization, the striving after the object appears in the form of an impulsion to mastery, in which injury or annihilation of the object is a matter of indifference. This form and preliminary stage of love is hardly to be distinguished from hate in its behaviour towards the object. Only when the genital organization is established does love become the antithesis of hate.

The relation of hate to objects is older than that of love. It is derived from the primal repudiation by the narcissistic ego of the external world whence flows the stream of stimuli. As an expression of the pain-reaction induced by objects, it remains in constant intimate relation with the instincts of self-preservation, so that sexual and ego-instincts readily develop an antithesis which repeats that of love and hate. When the sexual function is governed by the ego-instincts, as at the stage of the sadistic-anal organization, they impart the qualities of hate to the instinct's aim as well.

The history of the origin and relations of love makes us understand how it is that love so constantly manifests itself as ambivalent, i.e., accompanied by feelings of hate against the same object. This admixture of hate in love is to be traced in part to those preliminary stages of love which have not been wholly outgrown, and in part is based upon reactions of aversion and repudiation on the part of the ego-instincts which, in the frequent conflicts between the interests of the ego and those of love, can claim to be supported by real and actual motives. In both cases, therefore, the admixture of hate may be traced to the source of self-preservative instincts. When a love-relationship with a given object is broken off, it is not infrequently succeeded by hate, so that we receive the impression of a transformation of love into hate. This descriptive characterization is amplified by the view that, when this happens, the hate which is motivated by considerations of reality is reinforced by a regression of the love to the sadistic preliminary stage, so that the hate acquires an erotic character and the continuity of a love-relation is ensured.

The third antithesis of love, the transformation of loving into being loved, represents the operation of the polarity of active and passive, and is to be judged in the same way as in scoptophilia and sadism. We may sum up by saying that the essential feature in the vicissitudes undergone by instincts is their subjection to the influences of the three great polarities that govern mental life. Of these three polarities we might describe that of activity-passivity as the *biological*, that of ego-external world as the *real*, and finally that of pleasure-pain as the *economic* respectively.

That possible vicissitude undergone by an instinct which we call repression will form the subject of a further inquiry.
