## PREFACE TO THE TREATISE ON THE VACUUM

We have carried our respect for antiquity so far today, in matters in which it should have less influence, that we treat all its ideas as revelations and even its obscurities as mysteries; we can no longer advance new opinions without danger, and an author’s text is enough to destroy the strongest arguments. . .

Not that my intention is to correct one vice by another, and to have no esteem for the ancients because they are too much esteemed. I do not want to banish their authority to set up reason alone, although there is an attempt to establish their authority alone to the prejudice of reason. . .

To make this important distinction with care we must consider that one group *depends* exclusively on memory and are purely historical, having as their only object to know what the authors have written; the other group *depends* exclusively on reason and are wholly dogmatic, having as their object to seek and discover hidden truths. Those of the first kind have the same limits as the books containing them. . .

It is in accordance with this distinction that we should regulate differently the extent of our respect. The respect that we should have for. . .

In matters in which we seek to know only what authors have written, as in history, geography, jurisprudence, languages, and above all in theology, and in short wherever either the simple fact or an institution, human or divine, is the starting point, we must necessarily have recourse to books, since all that can be known about such matters is contained there. Whence it is evident that we can have the whole of that knowledge and that it is not possible to add anything to it.

If it is a question of knowing who was the first king of France, where the geographers put the first meridian, what words are used in a dead language, and everything of this sort, how could we find it out except from books? And who can add anything new to what they tell us about it, since we desire to know only what they contain? Authority alone can give us light on such matters. But it is in theology that authority has its chief weight because there it is inseparable from truth, which we know only through it; so that to give absolute certainty to things which reason can least grasp, it is sufficient to point them out in Holy Scripture (as, to show the uncertainty of the most probable things, we need only point out that they are not included there); because the principles of theology are above nature and reason, and the mind of man, too feeble to reach them by its own efforts, can arrive at this highest knowledge only if carried there by an all-powerful and supernatural force.

It is quite otherwise with subjects accessible to sense or reasoning: here authority is useless, only reason can know them. Authority and reason have their separate rights: a moment ago one had all the advantage; here the other is queen in her turn. But since subjects of this kind are suited to the mind’s reach, it has perfect freedom to concern itself with them; its inexhaustible fertility produces continually, and its discoveries can be at once without end and without interruption. . .

Thus it is that geometry, arithmetic, music, physics, medicine, architecture, and all the sciences subject to experiment and reason must be added to if they are to become perfect. The ancients found them merely sketched by their predecessors, and we shall leave them to our successors in a more perfected state than we received them. Since their perfection depends upon time and effort, it is evident that even if our effort and time had gained us less than the labors of the ancients, separated from ours, the two together nevertheless must have more effect than either alone.

The clearing up of this difference should make us pity the blindness of those who advance authority alone as proof in physics instead of reason or experiment, and should fill us with horror at the wickedness of others who use reason alone in theology instead of the authority of Scripture and the Fathers. We must strengthen the courage of those timid souls who dare discover nothing in physics, and confound the insolence of that temerity which introduces novelty into theology. Meanwhile the misfortune of the age is such that we see many new opinions in theology altogether unknown to antiquity maintained with obstinacy and received with applause; whereas those put forward in physics, though few in number, must be convicted of error, it seems, as soon as they shock, however little, received opinions. As if respect for the philosophers of antiquity were a duty but for the most ancient of the Fathers only decorum! I leave it to the judicious to observe the importance of this abuse which perverts the order of the sciences so unjustly, and I think there will be few who do not wish this . . . to be applied to other subjects, since new discoveries are inevitably errors in those matters we profane with impunity, whereas they are absolutely necessary for the perfection of so many other subjects incomparably lower, which however we would be afraid to touch.

Let us make a more just distribution of our credulity and our doubt, and set limits to our respect for the ancients. Since reason is its source, reason should also be its measure. Let us consider that if the ancients had kept to this deference of daring to add nothing to the knowledge transmitted to them and if their contemporaries had been as much opposed to accepting anything new, they would have deprived both themselves and their posterity of the fruit of their discoveries. Just as they used the discoveries handed down to them only as the means of making new ones, and that happy daring had opened the road for them to great achievements, so we should take the discoveries won for us by them in the same spirit, and following their example make these discoveries the means and not the end of our study, and thus by imitating the ancients try to surpass them. For what is more unfair than to treat our predecessors with more respect than they treated those who preceded them, and to have for them that inviolable respect they have deserved from us only because they did not themselves have it for those who had the same advantage over them? . . .

The secrets of nature are hidden. Although she is always at work, her effects are not always discovered: time reveals them from generation to generation, and although always the same in herself, she is not always equally known. The experiments which give us our knowledge of nature multiply continually; and since they are the only principles of physics, the consequences multiply in proportion. It is in this way that we can today have other ideas and new opinions without scorn and without ingratitude, since the first knowledge given us by the ancients has served as steps to our own, and since we are indebted to them for the advantage of a position higher than theirs; because placed by them part way up the ladder, we are carried higher by our slightest effort, and with less labor and less glory we find ourselves above them. It is from that height we can discover things it was impossible for them to see. Our view has a wider range, and although they knew as well as we do everything they could observe of nature, they nevertheless did not know so much and we see more than they did.

However it is a strange thing how we reverence their opinions. To contradict them counts as a crime and to add to them is an outrage, as if they had left no more truths to know. Is not this to treat man’s reason with indignity and to put it on a level with animal instinct, since we thereby take away the main difference, which consists in this that the effects of reason increase continually whereas instinct always remains in the same state? Beehives were as well laid out a thousand years ago as today, and each bee forms that hexagon as exactly the first time as the last. It is the same with everything animals make by that hidden motion. Nature teaches them in response to the pressure of necessity; but this frail knowledge dies with its need: as they receive it without study, they do not have the happiness of preserving it; and every time they are given it, they find it new, because nature, whose object is merely to maintain animals in an order of limited perfection, infuses in them this necessary knowledge, always the same, lest they perish, and does not allow them to add to it lest they go beyond the boundaries prescribed to them. It is different with man, made only for infinity. He is ignorant in his life’s first age, but he never ceases to learn as he goes forward, for he has the advantage not only of his own experience but also of his predecessors’, because he always keeps in his memory the knowledge he has once acquired, and that of the ancients is always at hand in the books they have left. And since he keeps his knowledge, he can also easily increase it, so that men today are in a certain sense in the same condition in which those ancient philosophers would be if they could have prolonged their old age until now, adding to the knowledge they had what their studies might have won for them by the grace of so many centuries. Hence it is that by a special prerogative not only does each man advance from day to day in the sciences, but all men together make a continual progress as the universe grows old, because the same thing happens in the succession of men as in the different ages of an individual man. So that the whole series of men during the course of so many centuries should be considered as one self-same man, always in existence and continually learning. Whence it is seen with what injustice we respect antiquity in the persons of its philosophers; for since old age is the age furthest removed from childhood, who does not see that the old age of this universal man should be sought not in the times near his birth but in those which are most distant from it? Those whom we call ancients were in truth new in every respect, and actually formed the childhood of man; and since we have added to their knowledge the experience of the succeeding centuries, it is in ourselves that that antiquity can be found which we revere in others.

The ancients should be admired for the consequences they drew correctly from the little stock of principles they had, and they should be excused for those in which they lacked the advantage of experiment rather than force of reason.

For were they not excusable for their opinion about the Milky Way when, the weakness of their eyes as yet unaided by artifice, they attributed its color to a greater density in that part of the sky, which would more powerfully reflect the light? But would we not be inexcusable for holding to the same opinion now that with the help of the telescope we have discovered an infinity of little stars there, whose more abundant light has made us recognize the true cause of that whiteness?

Did they not also have cause to say that all corruptible bodies were contained within the sphere of the moon’s heaven, when during the course of so many centuries they had never yet observed corruption or generation beyond this space? But should we not give contrary assurance when the whole earth has seen with its eyes comets burst into flame and vanish far beyond that sphere?

Thus it is that concerning the vacuum the ancients were right to say that nature did not permit it, because all their experiments had always led to the observation that she abhorred it and could not endure it. But if the new experiments had been known to them, perhaps they would have found reason to affirm what they had reason to deny because the vacuum had not yet appeared. Therefore in making the judgment that nature did not permit a vacuum, they meant to speak of nature only as they knew her; since to make the judgment in general it would not be enough to have seen it true in a hundred instances or in a thousand or in any other number however great, for if there remained a single case to examine, it alone would suffice to prevent the general definition, and if a single case were opposed, it alone. . . . For in all matters whose proof is by experiment and not by demonstration no universal assertion can be made except by the general enumeration of all the parts and all the different cases. Thus when we say the diamond is the hardest of all bodies, we mean of all bodies we know, and we neither can nor should include those we do not know. And when we say that gold is the heaviest of all bodies, it would be rash of us to include in this general proposition bodies not yet in our knowledge, although it is not impossible they are in nature. Similarly when the ancients asserted that nature did not permit a vacuum, they meant she did not permit a vacuum in all the experiments they had seen, and they could not without rashness include experiments they did not know. But if they had known them, undoubtedly they would have drawn the same consequences as we do and would by their avowal have given them the authority of that antiquity which men today want to make the sole principle of the sciences.

Thus without contradicting the ancients we can assert the opposite of what they said; and finally whatever the weight of antiquity, truth should always have the advantage, even when newly discovered, since it is always older than every opinion men have held about it, and only ignorance of its nature could imagine it began to be at the time it began to be known.

## NEW EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING THE VACUUM

Done in tubes, syringes, bellows, and siphons of various lengths, sizes, and shapes, with **divers fluids, such as quicksilver, water, wine, oil, air, etc.**

With a discourse on the same subject, in which it is shown that a vessel **as large as can be procured may be emptied of all substances known in nature which are capable of being perceived by the senses, and what force is necessary for the creation of this vacuum.**

Dedicated to M. Pascal, privy councilor and councilor of state to **the King, by B. P., his son, the whole having been reduced to a summary and published in advance of a larger treatise on the same subject.**

### To the Reader

My dear reader, since certain considerations prevent my publishing at this time in its entirety a treatise in which I have reported many new experiments I have made concerning the vacuum together with the conclusions I have drawn from them, I decided to give an account of the chief of them in this summary, where you will see in advance the plan of the whole work.

The occasion of these experiments was as follows: About four years ago in Italy it was found that *a glass tube four feet in height, with one end open and the other hermetically sealed, having been filled with quicksilver and the open end then stopped by a finger or in some other way and the tube placed vertically with the stopped end down and plunged two or three fingers' breadths into some more quicksilver contained in a vessel half full of quicksilver and half full of water; if the stopper is removed, the tube remaining plunged in the quicksilver of the vessel, the quicksilver of the tube descends part way, leaving at the top of the tube an apparently empty space, the bottom of the tube remaining full of quicksilver up to a certain height. And if the tube is lifted a little until its open end, which had been dipped in the quicksilver of the vessel, leaving this quicksilver, reaches the region of water, the quicksilver of the tube rises to the top with the water and these two liquids are mingled in the tube, but finally all the quicksilver falls, and the tube is found to be entirely filled with water.*

An account of this experiment having been sent from Rome to the Rev. Father Mersenne, Minim, at Paris, he made it public in France in the year 1644, to the admiration of all the learned and curious, through whose intercourse it became famous on all sides. I heard about it from M. Petit, Superintendent of Fortifications and skilled in all good learning, who had heard about it from the Rev. Father Mersenne himself. We did the experiment together at Rouen, the said M. Petit and I, in the same way it had been done in Italy, and we found every detail just as it had been reported from that country, without noticing at that time anything new.

Afterwards, reflecting on the consequences of these experiments, I was confirmed in the opinion I had always held that the vacuum was not a thing impossible in nature and that she did not flee it with such horror as many imagine.

I was forced to this opinion by seeing how slight was the foundation of the maxim so widely accepted that nature does not permit a vacuum, a maxim based only on experiments of which the greater number are false though considered most certain; and of the rest, some are so far from contributing to its proof that they show nature abhors too much fulness rather than flees a vacuum, and the most favorable do not bring anything more to light than that nature abhors a vacuum; they do not show that she cannot suffer it to be.

To the weakness of this principle I added our daily observations of the rarefaction and condensation of the air, which, as some have found, can be condensed to the thousandth part of the place it seemed to occupy before and which can become so rare that I thought there must be either a large vacuum between its parts or penetration of dimensions. But since everyone did not accept that as proof, I believed this Italian experiment might convince even those who were the most obsessed with the impossibility of the vacuum.

However prejudice was strong enough again to invent objections which robbed the experiment of the belief it deserved. Some said that the top of the tube was filled with spirits of mercury, others with a rarefied and imperceptible particle of air, others with a kind of matter which only existed in their imagination; and all, in a conspiracy to banish the vacuum, vied with each other in the exercise of that power of the mind called subtlety in the schools, which for the solution of real difficulties gives only empty words without foundation. I resolved therefore to devise such convincing experiments that they should be proof against all possible objections; and at the beginning of this year I performed a great many, of which some are related to the Italian experiment and others are entirely different, having nothing in common with it. These experiments were so accurate and so successful that I showed by means of them that the largest vessel procurable can be emptied of every substance perceived by sense and known in nature, and what force is necessary for the creation of this vacuum. In this way I also tested the height a siphon must have if it is to do what is expected of it, beyond which height it ceases to act, contrary to the opinion universally accepted by the world for so many centuries, as also the slight force required to draw up the piston of a syringe, without any matter taking its place, and many other things that you will find in the complete work, in which it is my intention to show what force nature exerts to avoid a vacuum and that she actually admits it and suffers its existence in a large space which can easily be emptied of every substance perceptible to sense. Accordingly I have divided the complete treatise into two parts, of which the first contains a detailed account of all my experiments, with accompanying figures, and a summary of the results, divided into a number of maxims. And the second part contains the consequences I have drawn from the experiments, divided into several propositions, in which I have shown that the apparently empty space which appeared in the experiments is actually empty of every substance perceptible to sense and known in nature. And in the conclusion I give my opinion on the subject of the vacuum, and reply to the objections that can be made. Thus I am content to show a large empty space, and I leave it to the learned and curious to find out what goes on in such a space (as whether animals live there, whether the refraction of glass is diminished by it, and whatever can be done there), making no mention of it in this treatise, a summary of which I have thought it appropriate to give you in advance; because having made these experiments with much expense, effort, and time, I was afraid that someone else who had spent neither time, money, nor effort might anticipate me and make public things he had not seen and which consequently he could not report with the exactness and order necessary for their proper deduction; for there is no one who has had tubes and siphons so long as mine, and there are few who would be willing to take the necessary trouble to get them.

And since honest men add to the common desire of all men to maintain themselves in their rightful possessions the desire to refuse the honor which is not their due, you will undoubtedly approve of my defending myself equally against those who would take from me some of the experiments which I report to you here and which I promise you in the complete treatise, since they are of my own invention, and against those who would attribute to me the Italian experiment I have spoken to you about, since it is not mine. For although I have performed it in more ways than anyone else and with tubes twelve and even fifteen feet long, nevertheless I shall not even speak of it in these writings because I am not its discoverer and because it is my intention to give only those experiments which are of my own invention and altogether mine.

### Summary of the first part, in which the experiments are reported

### Experiments

1.  A glass syringe with a carefully fitted piston having been completely immersed in water and its opening closed by a finger touching the bottom of the piston (thus obliging the hand and arm to be in the water), only a moderate force is required to draw the piston up and make it separate from the finger, without any water coming in (which the philosophers believed could not be done with any finite force); and thereby the finger is felt to be strongly and painfully pulled, and the piston leaves an apparently empty space, into which it does not appear any body can have entered, since it is entirely surrounded by water which could have had no access to it because the opening had been closed; and if the piston is drawn higher, the apparently empty space becomes greater, but the finger is not felt to be more pulled. And if the syringe is lifted almost entirely out of the water so that only its opening and the covering finger remain in it, then upon the finger’s being removed the water, contrary to its nature, rises with violence and entirely fills all the space left by the piston.

2.  A bellows carefully closed on every side produces the same effect, with a similar preparation, contrary to the opinion of the same philosophers.

3.  A glass tube forty-six feet long, open at one end and hermetically sealed at the other, having been filled with water or rather with very red wine, for greater visibility, then stoppered and lifted in this condition and placed vertically, the stoppered end down, in a vessel full of water, with about one foot of the tube below the surface of the water; if the stopper is removed, the wine in the tube descends to a certain height, which is about thirty-two feet above the surface of the water in the vessel, and runs out and mingles with the water in the vessel, to which it gives a tinge of color, and separating from the top of the glass leaves a space of about thirteen feet apparently empty, where again it does not appear any body can have taken its place. And if the tube is inclined, as then the height of the wine in the tube is decreased by this inclination, the wine ascends until it reaches the height of thirty-two feet. And finally if the tube is inclined to the height of thirty-two feet, it is entirely refilled, thus drawing back as much water as it had rejected wine, so that it is seen to be full of wine from the top to about thirteen feet from the bottom and filled with slightly colored water in the thirteen feet remaining.

4.  A scalene siphon, of which the longer leg is fifty feet long and the shorter leg is forty-five, having been filled with water and the two stoppered openings immersed about a foot in two vessels filled with water so that the siphon is vertical and the surface of the water of one vessel is five feet higher than the surface of the other; if the stoppers of the openings are removed with the siphon in the position described, the longer leg does not attract the water in the shorter leg nor consequently that in the vessel in which the shorter leg dips, contrary to the opinion of all philosophers and artisans, but the water descends from both legs into the two vessels until it reaches the same height as in the afore-mentioned tube, measuring the height from the surface of the water of each vessel. But when the siphon is inclined at a height less than about thirty-one feet, the longer leg attracts the water in the vessel of the shorter leg, and when the siphon is drawn up again toward the vertical, the attraction stops and water flows from both sides into their respective vessels. And when the siphon is lowered again, the water in the longer leg attracts the water in the shorter as before.

5.  If a cord about fifteen feet long with a thread fastened to the end (having been left in water for a long time in order that whatever air may have been enclosed in the cord might be expelled by the gradual absorption of moisture) is put in a tube fifteen feet long, sealed at one end as above and filled with water,

so that outside the tube there is only the thread attached to the cord to pull it with, and the opening of the tube is placed in quicksilver; when the cord is pulled little by little, the quicksilver rises in proportion until the height of the quicksilver, added to the fourteenth part of the height of the water remaining, is two feet, three inches. For afterwards, when the cord is pulled, the water quits the top of the glass and leaves an apparently empty space, which increases in proportion as the cord is pulled. But if the tube is inclined, the quicksilver of the vessel rises in it, so that if it is inclined enough, it is completely filled with quicksilver and water, which strikes the top of the tube with violence, making the same noise and the same sharp sound as if it were breaking the glass, which does in fact run the risk of being broken. And lest it be suspected that some air may have remained in the cord, the same experiment may be performed with a number of little wooden cylinders fastened together with brass wire.

6. A syringe with an accurately fitted piston having been placed in quicksilver so that its opening is immersed at least an inch and the rest of the syringe stands vertically outside, if the piston is drawn up, the syringe remaining as described, the quicksilver, entering by the opening of the syringe, rises and remains in contact with the piston until it has been drawn up in the syringe two feet, three inches. But after this height if the piston is drawn up more, it does not attract the quicksilver higher, which continuing to remain at this height of two feet, three inches quits the piston, so that an apparently empty space is formed, which increases in proportion as the piston is drawn up more. It is probable that the same thing happens in a *suction pump*, and that the water rises only to a height of *thirty-one feet*, which corresponds to that of *two feet, three inches* of quicksilver. And what is more remarkable is that the syringe, weighed as it is without being taken from the quicksilver or moved in any way, weighs just as much (although the apparently empty space be as small as we please) as when, the piston having been drawn up more, the apparently empty space is made as great as we please, and that it always weighs the same as the body of the syringe with the two feet, three inches of quicksilver it contains when there is not yet any apparently empty space, that is, when the piston has not yet quit the quicksilver in the syringe, but is ready to separate from it at the slightest pull. So that the apparently empty space, although all the bodies surrounding it tend to fill it, does not change its weight, and however these spaces may differ in size, they differ not at all in weight.

7. A siphon with one leg ten feet long and the other nine and a half, having been filled with quicksilver and the two openings having been immersed about an inch each in two vessels of quicksilver so that the surface of the quicksilver in one vessel is half a foot higher than in the other; when the siphon is vertical, the longer leg does not attract the quicksilver of the shorter, but the quicksilver, breaking at the top, descends in each of the legs and pours into the vessels, falling to the ordinary height of two feet, three inches from the surface of the quicksilver in each vessel. But if the siphon is inclined, the quicksilver in the vessels rises again in the legs, fills them and begins to run from the shorter leg into the longer leg and thus empties the shorter leg’s vessel; for the inclining of tubes containing an apparent vacuum, when they are in a fluid, always attracts the fluids in the vessels if the openings of the tubes are not closed, or attracts the finger if it closes these openings.

8. The same siphon having been entirely filled with water and afterwards with a cord as above and the two openings having also been put in the same two vessels of quicksilver, when the cord is drawn through one of the openings, the quicksilver rises from the vessels into both of the legs, so that the fourteenth part of the height of the water in one leg, together with the height of the quicksilver which has risen, is equal to the fourteenth part of the height of the water in the other, added to the height of the quicksilver which has risen; which will be the case as long as the fourteenth part of the height of the water, added to the height of the quicksilver in each leg, is two feet, three inches high, for afterwards the water will divide at the top and there will be an apparent vacuum.

From these experiments and from several others reported in the *complete book*, in which are seen tubes of all lengths, sizes, and shapes, filled with different fluids, immersed in divers ways in different fluids, carried from one to another, weighed in several ways, and in which are observed the different attractions felt by the finger stopping the mouths of tubes containing an apparent vacuum, it is clear that we may deduce the following maxims:

### Maxims

1. That it is repugnant to all bodies to separate from each other and to admit an apparent vacuum between them; that is, nature abhors an apparent vacuum.
2. That this abhorrence or repugnance on the part of all bodies is not greater for a large apparent vacuum than for a small one, that is, for a wide interval of separation than for a narrow one.
3. That the force of this abhorrence is limited, and equal to that with which water at a certain height, which is about thirty-one feet, tends to flow downward.
4. That the bodies forming the boundaries of an apparent vacuum tend to fill it.
5. That this tendency is not greater for a large apparent vacuum than for a small one.
6. That the force of this tendency is limited, and always equal to that with which water at a certain height, which is about thirty-one feet, tends to flow downward.
7. That a force greater by however little than that with which water at a height of about thirty-one feet tends to flow downward is sufficient to cause an apparent vacuum, and as great as we please, that is, to separate bodies by as great an interval as we please, provided there is no other obstacle to their separation and going apart than nature’s horror of an apparent vacuum.

Summary of the second part, in which are reported the consequences of these experiments, concerning the matter that might fill this apparently empty space, divided into several propositions with their demonstrations.

### Propositions

1. That the apparently empty space is not filled with the outside air surrounding the tube and that air has not come in through the pores of the glass.
2. That it is not filled with the air which some philosophers say is enclosed in the pores of all bodies, air which would be in this way in the liquid filling the tubes.
3. That it is not filled with the air which some consider to be between the tube and the liquid which fills it, and enclosed in the interstices or atoms of the small bodies constituting these liquids.
4. That it is not filled with an imperceptible particle of air, remaining by chance between the liquid and the glass, either carried by the finger acting as a stopper or introduced in some other way, which would become extraordinarily rarefied, and which some, rather than admit a vacuum, would maintain could become sufficiently rarefied to fill the whole world.
5. That it is not filled with a bit of quicksilver or water, which, drawn in one direction by the walls of the glass and in the other by the force of the liquid, becomes rarefied and transformed into vapor, so that this reciprocal attraction has the same effect as heat, which transforms these liquids into vapor and makes them volatile.
6. That it is not filled with the spirits of the liquid contained in the tube.
7. That it is not filled with a finer air mixed with the outside air, which, separated from it and having entered through the pores of the glass, would always tend to return or would be continually attracted back.
8. That the apparently empty space is not filled by any substance known in nature and perceptible to any sense.

## SUMMARY OF THE CONCLUSION, IN WHICH I GIVE MY OPINION

After having demonstrated that none of the substances perceived by our senses and known by us fills this apparently empty space, I shall think, until I am shown the existence of a substance filling it, that it is really empty and void of all matter.

Therefore I shall say of the real vacuum what I have shown of the apparent vacuum, and I shall consider the above maxims as true when now enunciated of the absolute vacuum as before of the apparent.

### Maxims

1. That it is repugnant to all bodies to separate from each other and to admit a vacuum between them; that is, nature abhors a vacuum.
2. That this abhorrence or repugnance on the part of all bodies is not greater for a large vacuum than for a small one, that is, for a wide interval of separation than for a narrow one.
3. That the force of this abhorrence is limited, and equal to that with which water at a certain height, which is about thirty-one feet, tends to flow downward.
4. That the bodies forming the boundaries of a vacuum tend to fill it.
5. That this tendency is not greater for a large vacuum than for a small one.
6. That the force of this tendency is limited, and always equal to that with which water at a certain height, which is about thirty-one feet, tends to flow downward.
7. That a force greater by however little than that with which water at a height of about thirty-one feet tends to flow downward is sufficient to cause a vacuum, and as great as we please, that is, to separate bodies by as great an interval as we please, provided there is no other obstacle to their separation and going apart than nature’s horror of a vacuum.

## AFTERWARDS I REPLY TO THE OBJECTIONS THAT COULD BE MADE, OF WHICH THE CHIEF ARE:

### Objections

1. That this proposition, a space is empty, is repugnant to common sense.
2. That this proposition, nature abhors a vacuum and nevertheless permits it to exist, accuses her of impotence or implies contradiction.
3. That many experiments, and even our everyday experience, show that nature cannot suffer the existence of a vacuum.
4. That an imperceptible matter, unheard of and unknown to any sense, fills this space.
5. That since light is either an accident or a substance, it is not possible for it to exist in a vacuum if it is an accident, and that it fills the apparently empty space if it is a substance.

## PASCAL’S ANSWER

To the Very Good Reverend Father Noel, Rector, of the Society of Jesus, Paris
My Very Reverend Father,

The honor you have done me in writing to me obliges me to give up my intention of resolving none of the difficulties mentioned in my *abridgement* except in the *complete work* on which I am at present engaged; for since the civilities of your letter are joined to the objections you raise against me, I cannot divide my answer nor acknowledge the former without satisfying the latter.

But to proceed with more order, permit me to remind you of a universal rule which is applicable to all the particular subjects in which our concern is with establishing truth. I do not doubt your acceptance of it since it is generally admitted by all who consider things with an open mind and since it constitutes the chief part of the method of the schools in dealing with the sciences and that used by seekers after what is really solid, filling and fully satisfying the mind. The rule is never to make a decisive judgment, affirming or denying a proposition, unless what one affirms or denies satisfies one of the two following conditions: either that of itself it appear so clearly and distinctly to sense or to reason, according as it is subject to one or the other, that the mind cannot doubt its certainty, and this is what we call a *principle* or *axiom*, as, for example, if *equals are added to equals, the results are equal*; or that it be deduced as an infallible and necessary consequence from such *principles* or *axioms*, upon whose certainty entirely depends that of the consequences correctly drawn from them, as this proposition, *the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles*, *which not being self-evident*, is evidently demonstrated as an infallible consequence of such *axioms*. Everything satisfying one of these two conditions is certain and true, and everything satisfying neither is considered doubtful and uncertain. We pass decisive judgment on things of the first kind and leave the rest undecided, calling them, according to their deserts, now a *vision*, now a *caprice*, occasionally a *fancy*, sometimes an *idea*, and at the most a *happy thought*; and since it is rash to affirm them, we incline rather to the negative, ready however to return to the affirmative if a convincing demonstration brings their truth to light. And we reserve for the mysteries of the faith, revealed by the Holy Spirit Himself, that submission of mind which leads us to believe in mysteries hidden from sense and reason.

This principle having been laid down, I turn to your letter, in whose first lines, to prove that the space in question is a body, you make use of the following words:
> I say that it is a body since it acts *like* a body, transmitting light with refraction and reflection, and retarding the motion of another body.

Upon which I observe that you base your claim that it is a body upon two principles: the first is that it transmits light with refraction and reflection; the second, that it retards the motion of a body. Of these two principles the first has seemed true to none of those who have tried to get experimental evidence of it, and we have always found on the contrary that the ray penetrating the glass and the apparently empty space has no refraction other than that caused by the glass, and that therefore if some matter fills this space, either it in nowise bends the ray or the refraction is not perceptible; so that since you have undoubtedly experienced nothing to the contrary, I perceive that the meaning of your words is that the ray reflected or refracted by the glass passes through this space. From that and from the fact that bodies take time to fall there, you wish to conclude that it is filled by a material substance which transmits the light and causes the retardation of motion.

But, Reverend Father, if we refer this to the method of reasoning we have spoken of, we shall find that we should first have to agree upon the definition of empty space, of light, and of motion, and to show from the nature of these things a manifest contradiction in the propositions: "*Light penetrates empty space, and it takes time for a body to move there.*" Until then your proof cannot hold, and since moreover the nature of light is unknown both to you and to me, since of all those who have tried to define it not one has satisfied any seeker after experienceable truths, and since it will perhaps remain eternally unknown to us, I foresee that it will be a long time before this argument acquires enough strength to be convincing.

For I beg you to consider how it is possible to conclude infallibly that the nature of light is such that it cannot exist in the void when we do not know what the nature of light is. But if our knowledge of it were as complete as is our ignorance, we should know perhaps that it would exist in the void with more brilliance than in any other medium since we perceive that it increases its strength according as the medium in which it is becomes rarer, and so somehow closer to nothingness. And if we knew the nature of motion, I do not at all doubt that it would appear to us that motion ought to take almost as much time in a vacuum as in air, whose non-resistance is apparent in the equal falling-time of bodies of different weights.

This is why, with our slight knowledge of the nature of these things, if by a similar liberty I conceive a thought which I offer as a principle, I can say with as much show of reason: *light subsists in a vacuum and it takes time for a body to move there*; but *light penetrates this apparently empty space and it takes time for a body to move there*; hence it may be really empty.

Therefore let us put off this proof until such time as we shall know the nature of light. Until then I cannot admit your principle, and it will be hard for you to prove it. And let us not, I beg you, draw infallible consequences from the nature of a thing when we do not know it; otherwise I should be afraid that you were not in agreement with me on the conditions necessary for a perfect demonstration, and that you would call certain what we only call doubtful.

In the rest of your letter, as if you had invincibly established that this void space is a body, you concern yourself only with finding what body it is, and to decide positively what kind of matter fills it you begin as follows:
> "Let us assume that, just as blood is made up of several liquids mingled together, so air is made up of air and fire and the (remaining) four elements which enter into the composition of all natural bodies."

You then assume that this fire can be separated from the air, and that once separated it can penetrate the pores of the glass; you again assume that once separated it has an inclination to return and again that it is incessantly drawn back; and you explain these statements, intelligible enough in themselves, by bringing in certain analogies.

But I think you offer this as an *idea*, Father, and not as a demonstration, and however hard it is for me to reconcile this belief with the end of your letter, I believe that if you wanted to give proofs, they would not be so unfounded. For in these times when so many learned men are trying with such care to find what matter fills this space, when this problem is agitating so many minds, it would be hard for me to believe you would offer as the longed-for solution of a question so justly doubtful nothing but a substance of which you suppose not only the properties but the very existence itself, so that if *anyone will make the contrary assumption, he will draw a contrary consequence just as necessarily*. If this kind of proof is acceptable, there will no longer be any difficulty in solving the greatest difficulties. And the ocean tides and the magnet’s attraction will become easy to understand, if it is permissible to make substances and properties for the purpose.

For all things of this kind whose existence is not manifest to sense are as hard to believe as they are easy to invent. Many persons, even among the most learned men of the day, have opposed me with this same substance before you (but simply as an *idea* and not as a certain truth), and that is why I mentioned it among my propositions. Others, to fill empty space with some kind of matter, have imagined one with which they have filled the entire universe, because imagination has this peculiarity that it produces the greatest things with as little time and trouble as little things; some have considered this matter as of the same substance as the sky and the elements, and others of a different substance, as their fancy dictated, for they disposed of it as of their own work.

But if we ask of them, as of you, that they show us this matter, they answer that it cannot be seen; if we ask that it make a sound, they say it cannot be heard, and so with all the remaining senses; and they think they have done much when they have convicted others of powerlessness to show that it does not exist by depriving themselves of all power to show that it does.

But we find more cause to deny its existence on account of our inability to prove it than to believe it for the sole reason that it cannot be shown not to be.

For we cannot believe in all these substances at once without making nature a monster, and since reason cannot incline more toward one than toward another because she finds them equally remote, she rejects them all to avoid an unjust choice.

I know you can say that you have not made this matter of yours all by yourself and that many physicists had already worked at it. But in this matter we base nothing on authority; when we cite authors, we cite their demonstrations and not their names; we respect them only in historical matters, so that if the authors you cite said they saw those little fiery bodies mingled with the air, I should sufficiently defer to their sincerity and to their accuracy to believe they were telling the truth and I should believe them as historians; but since they only say they think these particles are constituents of the air, you will permit me to remain in my first doubt.

Finally, Father, consider, I beg you, that all the men there are put together could not demonstrate that any body succeeds that which leaves the apparent vacuum, and again that it is impossible for all the men there are to show that when the water refills it some body has left. Should not that be sufficient, following your maxims, to assure the emptiness of the space? However I simply say that my opinion is that it is empty. Judge whether those who speak with so much restraint about something they have a right to speak about with so much assurance will find it possible to make a decisive judgment on the existence of this fiery matter, so doubtful and so little established.

After having supposed this substance with all the properties you wanted it to have, you explain some of my experiments. It is not a very difficult thing to explain how an effect can be produced if we suppose the substance, the nature, and the qualities of its cause; however it is hard for those who imagine them to resist an idle satisfaction and a secret charm which they find in their invention, especially when they have worked them out so well that from the imaginations they have supposed they necessarily infer truths already evident.

But I feel obliged to say a word or two to you in this connection. Every time to find the cause of several known phenomena we frame an hypothesis, this hypothesis can be of three kinds.

For sometimes an obvious absurdity follows from its negation, and then the hypothesis is true and certain; or an obvious absurdity follows from its affirmation, and then the hypothesis is considered false; and when we have not yet been able to draw an absurdity either from its negation or from its affirmation, the hypothesis remains doubtful. So that to establish the truth of an hypothesis it is not enough that all the phenomena should follow from it, whereas if there follows from it something opposed to a single phenomenon, that is enough to make certain its falsity.

For example, if someone finds a hot stone without knowing why it is hot, would he who should reason as follows be thought to have found the true cause: *Let us assume that this stone has been put in a big fire, from which it has very recently been removed; therefore this stone should still be hot; but it is hot; consequently it had been put in the fire*? For that, fire would have to be the only cause of a stone’s being hot; but since such heat can come from the sun or from friction, this inference would have no cogency. For just as the same cause can produce several different effects, so the same effect can be produced by several different causes. Thus in the discourse of natural reason on the motion or the stability of the earth all the phenomena of the motions and retrogradations of the planets follow perfectly from the hypotheses of Ptolemy, of Tycho, of Copernicus and from many others that could be framed, of all of which only one can be true. But who will venture to discern so far, and who can without risk of error support one to the prejudice of the others, as in the analogy of the stone who can with insistence maintain it is hot because of fire without making himself ridiculous?

You see from this that even if all the phenomena of my experiments followed from your hypothesis, it would still be like the rest; and that always remaining in terms of probability, it would never reach those of demonstration. But I hope one day to make you see more at length that the necessary consequences of its affirmation are opposed to the experiments. And to touch upon one of them in a few words here: If it is true, as you suppose, that the apparent vacuum is filled with that more subtle and fiery air, and that it has the inclination you suppose to return to the air it left, and that the outside air has the force to draw it back like a *squeezed sponge*, and that it is by this mutual attraction that the quicksilver is held suspended and is even made to rise again when the tube is inclined; it necessarily follows that when the apparent vacuum is greater, a larger column of quicksilver should be suspended (contrary to what is seen in the experiments). For since all the parts of the inside and outside air have this power of attraction, it is certain by all the laws of mechanics that their quantity, increased directly as the space, must necessarily increase their effect, as a large sponge when squeezed absorbs more water than a small one.

But if to resolve this difficulty you make a second supposition; and if you make another quality on purpose to save this awkwardness, which, still not accurate enough, obliges you to imagine a third supposition to save the other two, without any proof, any support; I shall never have anything to say except what I have already said, or rather I shall think I have already answered you.

But when I say this, Father, and when I anticipate in some sort these last suppositions, I myself make a false supposition, for I do not doubt that if you give us something, it will be supported by convincing arguments, since otherwise you would be imitating those who wish only to show that they have no lack of words.

Finally, Father, to restate the whole of my answer, if it should be true that this apparently empty space where a body (which I am very far from granting you), and the air were filled with fiery spirits (which I do not even find probable), and that they had the qualities you assign them (which is only a mere *idea*, evident neither to you nor to anyone) ; it would not follow that this space was filled with them. And again if it should be true that by supposing it were filled with them (which is in no way apparent) we could deduce everything in the experiments.

the most favorable judgment we could make of this opinion would be that it is probable. But since we necessarily infer from it things opposed to the experiments, judge what place it should have among the three kinds of hypotheses we spoke of above.

Toward the end of your letter, to define body, you only mention a few accidents, and those relative, as top, bottom, right, left, which actually constitute the definition of space, and which apply to a body only insofar as it occupies space. For according to your own authors body is defined as what is composed of form and matter; and what we call a void space is a space having length, breadth, and depth, motionless and capable of receiving and containing a body of the same size and shape; this is what we call a solid in geometry, where we consider only abstract and immaterial things. So that the essential difference between empty space and body, which has length, breadth, and depth, is that one is immobile and the other is mobile, and that one can receive within itself a body which penetrates its dimensions, whereas the other cannot; for the maxim on the impenetrability of dimensions is to be understood only of the dimensions of two material bodies; otherwise it would not be universally accepted. Whence it can be seen that there is as much difference between nothingness and empty space as there is between empty space and material body, and that thus empty space is a mean between material body and nothingness. That is why the maxim of Aristotle you mention, that *non-beings do not have differences*, is to be understood of true nothingness and not of empty space.

I take leave of your letter where you say that you do not recognize as being held by any physicist the fourth of my objections, namely, that a matter unheard of and not known to any sense fills this space. To which I answer that I can assure you of the contrary, since it is held by one of the most celebrated physicists of our time, whom you could have found in his works filling the whole universe with a universal matter, imperceptible and unheard of, of the same substance as the sky and the elements; and moreover that in examining your own matter I have found it to be so imperceptible and to have qualities so unheard of, that is, never considered as belonging to it, that I find it to be of the same nature.

The sentence preceding your final civilities defines light as follows: Light is a luminary motion of rays composed of *lucid*, that is, luminous bodies; with respect to which I must say that it seems to me you should first have defined *luminary*, and *lucid* or luminous body, for until that is done I cannot understand what light is. And since we never use in definitions the term defined, I should have difficulty in accepting yours, which says that light (*lumiere*) is a luminary motion of luminous bodies. There you have my views, Father, which I shall always submit to yours.

For the rest, you cannot be denied the glory of having maintained Peripatetic physics as well as it can be maintained; and I find your letter not less a mark of the weakness of the opinion you defend than of the vigor of your mind.

Certainly the skill with which you have defended the impossibility of a vacuum in the decline of its strength makes it easy to see that with an equal effort you would invincibly have established the opposed opinion in the advantages given it by the experiments.

The same indisposition that has deprived me of the honor of seeing you has kept me from writing with my own hand. It is for this reason I beg you to excuse the mistakes of my letter, especially in spelling.

I am with all my heart, Very Reverend Father, your very humble and very obedient servant,

Pascal
Paris, October 29, 1647.

## LETTER FROM PASCAL TO M. LE PAILLEUR, CONCERNING FATHER NOEL, JESUIT.

Sir,

Since you wish to know why I broke off the correspondence which the Reverend Father Noel had done me the honor of engaging me in, I want to give you prompt satisfaction; and I do not doubt that if you blamed my conduct before knowing its cause, you will approve it when you know the reasons that have held me back.

The strongest is that the Reverend Father Talon, when he took the trouble to bring me Father Noel's last letter, informed me in the presence of three of your good friends that Father Noel was distressed by my illness, that he feared my first letter had affected my health, and that he begged me not to run the risk of a second; in a word, not to answer; that we could clear up by word of mouth any remaining difficulties, and that moreover he begged me not to show his letter to anyone, that since he had written it only for me, he wished it to be seen by no one else, and that to make letters public was to violate their nature, addressed, as they are, to particular persons.

I confess that if this proposal had come from anyone except these good fathers, I should have been suspicious and I should have feared that its author wished to take advantage of my silence after having secured it by trickery. But I had so little doubt of their sincerity that I promised everything without reservation or fear. Afterwards I was especially careful to keep Father Noel's letter to myself and not to answer it. Whereupon several persons and even some Jesuit fathers who were not well informed of the wishes of Father Noel took occasion to say that, having found in his letter the overthrow of my opinions, I concealed its beauties lest my shame be discovered, and that it was by my weakness alone I was prevented from replying.

You see, Sir, how unfortunate for me this circumstance was, since I could not conceal the letter without disadvantage nor make it public without breach of faith, and that my honor was equally threatened both by a reply and by silence in that one betrayed my promise and the other my interest.

However I religiously kept my word, and I was saving my reply to his letter for the treatise in which I have to make specific answers to all the objections made against the proposition advanced in my abridgement, "that this space is not filled with any substance perceptible to sense and known in nature." Accordingly I thought I was not at all obliged to be in a hurry with my reply, which I wished to make more exact by postponing it for a while. To these considerations I added this, that since all differences of this kind go on forever unless someone breaks them off and since they cannot be concluded unless one of the two parties begins to make an end, I thought that the age, distinction, and calling of Father Noel obliged me to yield him the advantage of having had the last word in the matter. But besides all these reasons, I confess that his letter alone was enough to give me a dispensation from answering, and I am sure you will find that it seems to have been expressly conceived in terms that would not put upon me the obligation of a reply.

To make this clear I shall put before you the points Father Noel takes up, but in a different order such as he undoubtedly would have followed in a more elaborate work but did not judge necessary in the artlessness of a letter; for each of these points is scattered throughout the whole body of his discourse and lodged in almost every part of it.

It is his intention to state that he was led by my letter to give up his first opinion without being able however to fall in with mine. So that we may consider his letter as having two parts, of which one contains the things that prevent him from agreeing with me and the other those that support his second view. With respect to each of these parts I hope to show you how little I was obliged to reply.

As to the first, concerning the things that keep him from my view, his first difficulties are that the apparently empty space can only be a body since it receives and transmits light, and since it retards the motion of another body. But I thought I had sufficiently shown him in my letter the weakness of these same objections as contained in his first letter; for I told him in tolerably clear words that even if it takes time for bodies to fall in this space and even if it is penetrated by light, these effects should not necessarily be attributed to a substance filling it, since it is possible that they belong to the nature of motion and of light, and that as long as we remain in our present ignorance of the nature of these things, we should make no inferences from it since they would be based merely on uncertainty; and that, just as Father Noel infers from the appearance of these effects that this space is filled by a substance receiving light and retarding motion, it is possible with as much reason to infer from these effects that light subsists and motion requires time in a vacuum, in view of the fact that so many other things were favorable to this latter view that it was, in the opinion of the learned, incomparably more probable than the other even before it received the support of these experiments.

But if Father Noel has shown here that he paid little attention to that part of my letter, he gives evidence of not having understood another part by the second thing shocking him in my view; for he imputes to me an opinion contrary to the terms both of my letter and of my printed statement and entirely opposed to the foundation of all my maxims. He imagines that I decisively asserted the real existence of the vacuum, and on the basis of this imagination, which he takes as certain truth, he exercises his pen to show the weakness of the assertion.

However he could have seen I wrote in my printed statement that my conclusion is simply that I shall think "this space is empty until I have been shown that some substance fills it," which is not an assertion of the reality of the vacuum; and he could also have seen that I wrote in my letter the following words, which seem to me sufficiently clear:
> "Finally, Father, consider, I beg you, that all the men there are put together could not demonstrate that any body succeeds that which leaves the apparent vacuum, and again that it is impossible for all the men there are to show that when the water refills it some body has left. Should not that be sufficient, following your maxims, to assure the emptiness of the space? However I simply say that my opinion is that it is empty. Judge whether those who speak with so much restraint about something they have a right to speak about with so much assurance will find it possible to make a decisive judgment on the existence of this fiery matter, so doubtful and so little established."

Accordingly I should never have guessed what gave rise to this idea in Father Noel if he had not revealed it to me himself in the first page, where he faithfully repeats the definition of void space I gave in my letter, which is as follows:
> "What we call a void space is a space having length, breadth, and depth, motionless and capable of receiving and containing a body of the same size and shape; this is what we call a solid in geometry, where we consider only abstract and immaterial things."
After having repeated this definition word for word he immediately derives from it this consequence:
> "There, Sir, is your notion of void space, very clearly stated; I am willing to believe that all this is obvious to you and that your mind is convinced and fully satisfied by it, since you affirm it."

If he had not repeated my own words, I should have supposed he had misread them or that they had been badly written, and that instead of the first words, *I call*, he must have found, *I assert*. But since he quoted my entire sentence, I can only suppose he believes one of these terms necessarily implies the other, and that he does not distinguish between defining a thing and asserting its existence.

Therefore he believed that I asserted the real existence of the vacuum by the very terms with which I defined it. I know that those who are not accustomed to seeing things handled in the true order imagine that we cannot define a thing unless we are assured of its existence; but they should notice that we ought always to define things before investigating their possibility, and that the steps leading to the knowledge of truths are definition, axiom, and proof. For first we conceive the idea of a thing; then we give a name to this idea, that is, we define it; and finally we try to discover the truth or falsity of the thing. If we find it is impossible, it passes for error; if we demonstrate its truth, it passes for truth; and as long as we can demonstrate neither its possibility nor its impossibility, it passes for imagination. Whence it is evident that there is no necessary connection between the definition of a thing and the assertion of its existence, and that we can just as well define an impossible thing as a true thing. Thus we can call rectilinear and rectangular a triangle we should imagine as having two right angles, and afterwards show that such a triangle is impossible; thus Euclid first defines parallels and shows afterwards that they can be, and the definition of the circle precedes the postulate which lays down its possibility; thus the astronomers have given names to the concentric and eccentric circles and to the epicycles they have imagined in the heavens, without possessing any certainty that the stars actually describe such figures by their motions; thus the Peripatetics have given a name to that fiery sphere whose truth it would be difficult to demonstrate.

This is why when I wished to oppose Father Noel's decision, which excluded the vacuum from nature, I thought that I could not enter upon this attempt or even say a word about the matter until I had declared what I understand by the word *vacuum*, to which I felt myself the more obliged by certain passages in Father Noel's first letter from which I judged that his notion of the vacuum was not in conformity with mine. I saw that he was unable to distinguish between dimensions and matter, between immateriality and non-being; and that this confusion made him conclude that when I attributed to the apparently empty space length, breadth, and depth, I committed myself to saying that it was a body, and that from the moment I made it immaterial, I reduced it to nothing. To untangle all these ideas, I stated this definition for him, in which he can see that what we conceive and express by the words empty space holds the mean position between material substance and nothingness, without participating in either; that it differs from non-being by having dimensions, and that its non-resistance and immobility distinguish it from matter, so that it keeps between these two extremes without losing itself in either.

Toward the end of his letter Father Noel gathers together into one sentence all his objections to make them stronger by uniting them. His words are:
> this space which is neither God nor creature, neither mind nor body, neither substance nor accident, which transmits light without being transparent, which resists without resistance, which though immobile is moved with the tube, which is everywhere and nowhere, which does everything and nothing. These are the wonderful qualities of void space: as space it exists and performs miracles, as void it is nothing and does nothing; as space it has length, breadth, and depth, as void it excludes length, breadth, and depth. If desired, I shall show that all these fine properties follow necessarily from a void space.

Since a long series of fine things is fatiguing in the end by its very length, I think Father Noel grew weary on this occasion from having given birth to so many; and that, foreseeing a like fatigue on the part of his readers, he wanted to descend from a graver to a less serious style, to refresh them with a little raillery in order that, after having supplied them with so many things calling for the effort of admiration, he might give them, of his charity, something for amusement. I was the first to feel the effect of this benevolence, and whoever reads his letter afterwards will experience it too; for no one, reading what I wrote, but will laugh at the inferences Father Noel draws from it and at those antitheses opposed with so nice a care that it is easy to see he was more concerned with making his terms antithetical to each other than conformable to reason and truth.

For to take up these objections one by one: *this space, he says, is neither God nor creature*. Mysteries having to do with the Divine Nature are too holy for us to profane with our disputes; they should be an object of worship for us and not a subject of discourse. So that without discussing them in any way I submit my judgment entirely to what they shall decide who have the right to decide.

*Neither mind nor body*. It is true that space is neither mind nor body but is space; just as time is neither mind nor body but is time; and just as time does not cease to be although it is neither of these things, so void space may perfectly well be, without having to be either mind or body.

*Neither substance nor accident*. True, if we understand by the word substance what is either mind or body. For in this sense space will be neither substance nor accident but will be space; just as in this same sense time is neither substance nor accident, but is time; because in order to be, it is not necessary to be either substance or accident certain of the Jesuits maintaining that God is neither one nor the other although he is the Supreme Being.

*Which transmits light without being transparent*. These words are so lacking in light that they are dark to me. For I do not understand what meaning the word transparent has for Father Noel, since he finds that it cannot be said of void space. For if like all opticians he understands by *transparence* the absence of any hindrance to the passage of light, I do not see why he denies it to our space, which lets light pass freely. So that speaking on this subject with my small knowledge, I should have said to him that the words *transmit light*, which belong only to his way of imagining light, mean the same as *let light pass* and *it is transparent*, that is, offers no obstacle to light, in which I find neither absurdity nor contradiction.

*It resists without resistance*. Since he judges of the resistance of this space only by the fact that it takes time for bodies to move in it, and since we have had so much to say on the nullity of this inference, it will be seen that he is wrong in saying it resists; and it will be found on the contrary that this space does not resist or that it is without resistance, in which I see nothing but what is perfectly conformable to reason.

*Which though immobile is moved with the tube*. Here Father Noel shows how little he understands the opinion he wishes to refute; and I should have to beg him to observe in this connection that when an opinion is embraced by a number of learned men, we should not attach importance to objections that appear fatal when they are very easy to anticipate, because we should suppose that those who maintain this opinion are already aware of them, and that since they stick to their opinion in spite of the obviousness of the objections, they have found an answer to them. But to examine this difficulty in particular, if these antitheses or contraries had not dazzled his mind as much as they charmed his fancy, he would undoubtedly have noticed that, whatever may seem to be the case, the vacuum is not moved with the tube, and that immobility is as natural to space as motion is to body. To make this truth evident we must observe that space in general comprehends all natural bodies, each one of which individually occupies a certain part of it, but that although they are all mobile, the space they fill is not. For when a body is moved from one position to another, it merely changes place, without carrying with it the place it occupied while at rest. In fact what does it do except leave its first immobile place, successively to take up others equally immobile? But the place it quits remains still firm and unshakeable, so that either it is filled by another body succeeding that which has gone or it is left empty if no successor presents itself; but whether void or filled, ever equally at rest, this vast space, whose immensity embraces the universe, is as stable and immobile in each of its parts as in its totality. Therefore I cannot see how Father Noel could maintain that the tube communicates its motion to the void space, which, offering neither consistency for pushing nor a hold for pulling and without susceptibility to weight or to any attractive force, obviously cannot be made to change. Father Noel was led astray by the fact that when the tube was carried from one place to another, he saw no change inside it, and so he thought the space continued to be the same since it was always like itself. But he should observe that the space enclosed by the tube in one position is not the same as the space enclosed by it in the following position, and that the tube in the course of its motion continually acquires new spaces; so that the space that was empty in its first position is filled with air when it quits it to take the second, in which it makes void the space encountered whereas this space was filled with air before; but both of these spaces, alternately filled and void, always remain equally immobile. Whence it is evident that it is out of the question to believe that the void space changes place; and what is strangest is that the substance with which Father Noel fills it is such that according to his own hypothesis it could not be carried by the moving tube; for since it would enter and leave the glass through its pores with perfect ease without in any way adhering to it, like water in a sieve, it is obvious that it would not be carried along with it, just as we see that this same tube does not transport light, which penetrates it easily and freely, and that our space itself, when exposed to sunlight, changes rays when it changes place without carrying with it to its second place the light which filled it in the first, and in different positions it receives different rays as well as divers spaces.

Finally Father Noel is amazed that it should *do everything and nothing*, that it should *be everywhere and nowhere*, that it should perform *miracles though not existing*, that it should have *dimensions without having them*. If these words have any meaning, I confess that I do not understand it; therefore I do not consider myself obliged to answer them.

There you have, Sir, Father Noel's objections and the things that shock him in my view. But since they are evidence rather of his not understanding my opinion than of his gainsaying it and since he seems to find obscurity rather than error in it, I thought he would find its clarification in my letter if he would take the trouble to read it more carefully; and that therefore I was under no obligation to answer him since a second reading would sufficiently resolve the doubts arising from the first.

With reference to the second part of his letter, which is taken up with the changing of his first opinion and the establishing of his second opinion, he first states why he denies the *vacuum*. The reason he gives is that the *vacuum* cannot be perceived by any of the senses; whence he takes occasion to say that just as I deny the existence of matter [in the top of the tube] for this reason alone that it gives no sensible indication of its presence and that the mind conceives no necessity for it, he can with as much force and more deny the *vacuum* because it has this in common with the matter, that it is perceived by no sense. His words are:
> We say that there is water because we see and touch it; we say that there is air in an inflated balloon because we feel its resistance; that there is fire because we feel the heat; but the true vacuum touches none of our senses.

But I am surprised that Father Noel should compare things so dissimilar, and that he should not have observed that, as there is nothing so opposed to being as non-being or to affirmation as negation, we proceed to their demonstration by opposed methods, and that what establishes one overthrows the other. For what is needed for the knowledge of non-being except to know the utter lack of every kind of quality and effect; whereas if a single one appeared, we would infer on the contrary the real existence of a cause producing it? And then he says:
> Consider, Sir, which of us two is the more to be believed, you who assert the existence of a space hidden to sense and serving neither art nor nature, which you make use of only to decide a very doubtful question, etc.

But I leave it to you to decide, Sir, when we see nothing and the senses perceive nothing in a place, which is on firmer ground, he who asserts that there is something although he perceives nothing or he who thinks there is nothing because he does not see anything.

After Father Noel has declared, as we have just seen, his reason for excluding the vacuum, and has found grounds for denying it in that very privation of qualities which so justly gives occasion to others to believe in it and is the only sensible means of proving its existence, he now undertakes to show that it is a body. To this end he thought up a definition of body expressly conceived to fit our space that he might easily draw his inference from it. His words are:
> I define body as that which is composed of separate parts, and I say that every body is space when it is considered between its boundaries, and that every other space is body because it is composed of separate parts.

But to show that our space is not void it is not a question here of giving it the name of *body*, as Father Noel has done, but of showing that it is a *body*, as he claims to have done. Not that it is not permissible for him to give to what has separate parts any name that pleases him; but he will win small advantage from this liberty, for the word *body* as a result of his use of it becomes equivocal. So that there will be two kinds of things, entirely different and even heterogeneous, called *body*: one, that which has separate parts, for we shall call that *body*, following Father Noel; the other, a material substance, mobile and impenetrable, for we shall call that *body* in common parlance. But he will not be able to conclude from

this nominal resemblance a resemblance of real properties or to show in this way that what has separate parts is the same thing as a material, immobile, impenetrable substance, because it is not in his power to make them agree in nature as well as in name. Just as, if he had given to what has separate parts the name *water*, *mind*, or *light*, which he could have done as easily as give it that of *body*, he could not have drawn the conclusion that our space was any of these things. Thus when he has called *body* what has separate parts and says as a consequence of that definition, 'I say that every space is body,' we should take the word *body* in the sense he has just given it; so that if we substitute the definition in place of the thing defined, which can always be done without changing the meaning of a proposition, it will be found that the conclusion, *every space is body*, is nothing but *every space has separate parts*, but not *every space is material*, as Father Noel fancied. I shall not dwell longer on an inference so patently weak, since I am speaking to an excellent mathematician and since you have as much skill in discovering defects in reasoning as you have strength to avoid them.

The Reverend Father Noel, going further, wishes to show what this body is; and to establish his view he begins with a long discourse, in which he claims to prove the continual and necessary mixture of the elements, but shows nothing except that some parts of one element are found among those of another, and that they are confounded rather by accident than by nature; so that it might come about that they would separate without violence and return of themselves to their original unmixed state. For the natural mingling of two bodies occurs when their separation makes them change both their name and their nature. Such is the mingling of all metals and of all things made up of different elements, because when the mercury which enters into the composition of gold has been removed, what remains is no longer gold. But in the mixture Father Noel imagines for us we see only a violent confusion of certain vapors scattered in the air, which remains there like dust, without appearing to enter into the composition of the air, and similarly for the other mixtures. And as for that of water and air, which he offers as the best demonstrated and which he says is peremptorily proved by those bellows made by water falling into a chamber almost entirely closed (which you see explained at length in his letter), it is strange that Father Noel has not noticed that the air which he says emerges from the water is nothing but the outside air carried with it by the falling water, which air is completely free to go in by the same opening (wider than the opening from which the water comes), so that the water, spreading out as it falls into this opening, carries in with it all the air it meets and envelops, preventing its escape by the violence of its fall and the impact of its motion; so that air, continually entering through this opening and unable ever to leave by it, escapes with violence through the opening it finds free. Since it is by this experiment alone that Father Noel proves the mixture of water and air and since the experiment in no way shows it, he is found not at all to have proved it.

The mixture he least proves and is most concerned with is the mixture of fire with the other elements; for all that can be concluded from the experiments of the handkerchief and the cat is that certain of their greasiest and most oily particles catch fire from the friction, since they are already so disposed by the heat. He then declares it to be his opinion that our space is filled with this fiery matter, spread out and intermingled, as he supposes without proof, in all the elements and extended over the whole universe. This is the matter he puts in the tube. As for the suspension of the liquid, he attributes it to the weight of the outside air. In this I was delighted to see him adopting the view of those who have the most penetratingly examined these experiments; for you know that the letter written by the great Torricelli to Ricci more than four years ago shows that at that time he already held this opinion, and that more and more all our men of science are in agreement and support each other on this point. However, we are waiting for the confirmation of the experiment which is to be performed on one of our high mountains. But I do not hope to hear the results for some time because, in answer to letters I wrote more than six months ago, I have always been told that the tops of the mountains are inaccessible because of the snow.

This then is Father Noel’s second opinion; and although there seems to be little difference between this matter and the matter he puts in the tube in his first letter, it is nevertheless greater than appears, as I shall show.

In his first view nature abhorred a vacuum and made that horror felt; in his second view nature gives no indication of the horror she has of the vacuum and does nothing to prevent it. In the first he attributed an attractive faculty to this subtle matter and to all other bodies; in the second he does away with all attraction both active and passive. Finally he attributed many properties to it in the first of which he deprives it in the second. So that if there are several steps in the descent to nothingness, this matter is now on the last, and it seems there is only some remnant of prejudice that prevents him from throwing it headlong in.

But I should like to know from Father Noel how he comes to have such an ascendancy over nature and to exercise so absolute an empire over the subservient elements that they change their properties as he changes his mind, and that the universe accommodates its effects to the inconstancy of his intentions. I do not understand what blindness can be proof against such light or how any faith can be placed in what oneself causes to be or not to be with such ease.

But the chief difference I find between the two opinions is that Father Noel affirmatively asserted the truth of the first and that he proposes the second simply as an opinion. This is the influence of my first letter and the chief effect it had on his mind; so that, just as I had replied to his first opinion that I did not believe it met the conditions necessary for the affirmation of a thing, so I shall say to the second opinion that since he offers it only as an idea and since neither reason nor sense bears witness to the matter he establishes, I leave him in his opinion, as I leave in their opinion those who think there are dwellers in the moon and that in the inaccessible regions about the poles there are men entirely different from ourselves.

throughout the whole universe, and that he gives to the outer air the force to suspend the liquid. Whence it is easy to see that this idea is in no respect different from M. Descartes', since Father Noel concurs in the cause of the suspension of the quicksilver as well as in the matter which fills the apparently empty space, as is seen by his own words on page 6 where he says that this matter, which he calls *subtle air*, is the same as that M. Descartes calls *subtle matter*. Therefore I have believed myself less obliged to answer him, since I should make my answer to the father of this opinion.

As I was writing these last lines Father Noel did me the honor of sending me his book on another subject, bearing the title, *The Plenum of the Vacuum*. He charged the person who took the trouble to deliver it to assure me there was nothing in it against myself, and that any words that seemed to be harsh were addressed not to me but to the Reverend Father Valerianus Magni, Capuchin. And the reason he gave is that Father Magni affirms the existence of the vacuum, whereas I only profess to oppose those who speak dogmatically on this subject. But Father Noel would have acquitted me of this charge better if he had made his testimony as public as the suspicion he had given rise to.

I glanced through this book, and I found he has a different idea there, that he puts in our tube a matter close to his first, but attributes the suspension of the quicksilver to a quality he assigns to it which he calls *moving levity*, and not to the weight of the outside air, as in his letter.

To make a little survey of the book in brief compass, the title promises in the first place to demonstrate the plenum by new experiments and to confirm it by mine. At the beginning of the book Father Noel sets himself up as the defender of nature, and by an allegory, perhaps a little drawn out, he conducts a suit-at-law in which he makes her complain of the belief in the void as of a calumny; and without her having imparted to him her resentment or having charged him to defend her, he assumes the office of her advocate. And in this capacity he asserts that he will expose the imposture and false depositions of the witnesses against her — this is how he refers to our experiments — and promises to produce witness for witness, that is, experiment for experiment, and to show that ours have been badly understood and worse verified. But in the body of the book, when it is a question of carrying out these large promises, he speaks only to doubt; and having given hopes of so high a vengeance, he but brings in guesses instead of convictions. For in the third chapter, when he wishes to establish that the apparent vacuum is a body, he simply says he finds it much more reasonable to say that it is a body. When it is a question of showing the mixture of the elements, he only adds some very weak things to those he had mentioned in his letter. When it is a question of showing that the world is a plenum, he gives no proof. It is on such empty appearances he establishes his *ether*, imperceptible to sense, with the imaginary levity he attributes to it.

What is strange is that Father Noel, after having given doubts to support his view, confirms it by false experiments. However he proposes them with such boldness that they would be accepted as true by everyone who has not seen the opposite; for he says that the eyes show, that all this cannot be denied, that we see it with our eyes (although our eyes show us the opposite). Thus it is evident he has seen none of the experiments he talks about, and it is strange he should have spoken with so much assurance of things he did not know and of which he had been given anything but a faithful account. For I prefer to believe that he was himself deceived and not that he wanted to deceive others, and the esteem I have for him makes me judge that he was too credulous rather than lacking in sincerity. Certainly he has reason to complain of those who told him that a bellows full of this apparent vacuum, when quickly opened and closed, emits a substance sensible as air; and that when a tube filled with quicksilver and this same vacuum is turned upside down, the quicksilver falls as slowly in the vacuum as in the air, the vacuum retarding its natural motion as much as the air, and in short many other things he reports. For I assure him on the contrary that the air enters and the quicksilver falls in this vacuum with the utmost impetuosity, etc.

Finally, that you may see Father Noel does not understand the experiments recorded in my printed statement, I draw your attention to this point among others: I said in the first experiments of mine he gave an account of,
> that a glass syringe with a carefully fitted piston having been completely immersed in water and its opening closed by a finger touching the bottom of the piston (thus obliging the hand and arm to be in the water), only a moderate force is required to draw the piston up and make it separate from the finger, without any water coming in (which the philosophers believed could not be done with any finite force); and thereby the finger is felt to be strongly and painfully pulled, and the piston leaves an apparently empty space, into which it does not appear any body can have entered, since it is entirely surrounded by water which could have had no access to it because the opening had been closed; and if the piston is drawn higher, the apparently empty space becomes greater, but the finger is not felt to be more pulled.
Father Noel thought that the words, *is not felt to be more pulled*, have the same meaning as *is no more felt to be pulled*; whereas according to all the rules of grammar they mean that the finger does not feel a greater pull. And since he knows the experiments only through reading them, he thought the finger actually no longer felt any pull, which is absolutely false, for the pull continues to be felt just as before. But Father Noel’s hypothesis is so accommodating that he demonstrates, as a necessary consequence of his principles, why the finger no longer feels any pull, although it is absolutely false that it does not. I think he will be able to give as easily the reason for the opposite by the same principles. But I do not know what esteem the judicious will have for his method of demonstration if he proves with equal force the affirmative and the negative of the same proposition.

From which you see, Sir, that Father Noel bases this invisible matter on false experiments in order to explain other experiments he has imperfectly understood. And so it was right and proper that he should make use of a matter we would be unable to see and cannot understand to reply to experiments he has not seen and has not understood. When he is better informed about them, I do not doubt that he will change his mind, especially with respect to his *moving levity*. Therefore the reply to this book should be postponed until Father Noel has corrected it and has recognized the falsity of the facts and the imposture of the witnesses he offers in opposition and until he no longer bases his charges against the belief in the vacuum on experiments badly understood and worse verified.

While writing these words I have just received a printed notice from Father Noel which overthrows the greater part of his book: he withdraws the *moving levity* of the *ether* and calls back the weight of the outside air to suspend the quicksilver. So that I find it rather hard to refute Father Noel's opinions, since he is more prompt in changing them than one can be in replying to him; and I begin to see that his conduct is very different from mine because he makes his opinions public as fast as they occur to him; but the very fact that they contradict each other is sufficient to show their want of solidity, since the power with which he disposes of this matter is evidence enough that he is its author and consequently that it exists only in his imagination.

All who resist truth suffer from a like inconstancy of thought and they who fall into such variableness are to be suspected of denying truth. Accordingly it is curious to see among the defenders of the plenum the great number of opinions clashing with each other; one supports *ether* (and excludes every other substance); another, the spirits of the liquid [in the tube] to the prejudice of *ether*; another, the air contained in the bodies' pores (and banishes everything else); another, rarefied air void of every other body. Finally there are those who, not having dared to place the immensity of God there, have chosen among men a person so illustrious by birth and merit that his mind could be placed there and made to fill the universe. So each of them has all the rest for enemies; and as all conspire to destroy one alone, he necessarily succumbs. But since they only triumph over each other, they are all victorious without a single one of them being able to profit by his victory, because all this advantage comes from their own confusion. So that it is not necessary to fight with them to destroy them, since it is enough to abandon them to themselves, for they make up a body divided against itself, whose members opposed to each other rend themselves within, whereas the friends of the vacuum remain in a unity always the same, which by this very fact is so related to truth that it should be followed until truth appears to us openly. For it is not in entanglement and tumult that truth should be sought; it cannot be found apart from that maxim which permits us to decide only about evident things, and which forbids us to affirm or to deny those which are not. This is the just mean and perfect balance that you keep to with such advantage and that I, by a good fortune I can never acknowledge enough, was always brought up in with singular method and more than paternal care.

There you have, Sir, the reasons that have restrained me, reasons I did not think I ought longer to conceal from you. And although it may seem that I write this rather for my own interest than for your curiosity, I hope this doubt will not go so far as yourself, since you know that I have much less uneasiness about these fantastic points of honor than passion to converse with you, and that I find much less charm in defending my opinions than in assuring you that I am with all my heart, Sir, your very humble and very obedient servant,

Pascal

## ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT EXPERIMENT CONCERNING THE EQUILIBRIUM OF FLUIDS

Devised by M. Pascal
To COMPLETE THE TREATISE PROMISED BY HIM IN HIS *ABRIDGMENT ON THE VACUUM* AND CARRIED OUT BY M. PERIER ON ONE OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS IN AUVERGNE.

When I published my abridgment under the title: *New experiments concerning the vacuum*, etc., in which I had made use of the maxim on the horror of the vacuum because it was universally accepted and because I did not yet have convincing proofs to the contrary, I continued to feel certain difficulties which made me seriously doubt the truth of that maxim; to clear up these difficulties I thought at that time of the experiment here recorded, which would make it possible for me to know with certainty what I ought to believe. I have called it the great experiment on the equilibrium of fluids because it is the most significant of all the experiments that can be made on this subject in that it shows the equilibrium of air and quicksilver, which are the lightest and the heaviest of all fluids known in nature. But because it was impossible to carry out the experiment here in Paris, because there are only a very few places in France suited to this purpose, and because Clermont in Auvergne is one of the most convenient, I asked my brother-in-law, M. Perier, councilor on the Board of Excise of Auvergne, to be at the trouble of doing it there. It will be seen from the letter I wrote him at that time what my difficulties were and just what this experiment is.

### COPY OF THE LETTER OF M. PASCAL THE YOUNGER TO M. PERIER, November 15, 1647

Sir,

I would not interrupt the official duties with which you are constantly occupied in order to discuss physical speculations with you if I did not know that they will help to refresh you in your leisure hours and that whereas they would be a burden to others, you will find amusement in them. I have the less hesitation in doing this as I know the pleasure you take in such conversations. This one will be only a continuation of those we have had together about the vacuum. You know what the philosophers have thought on this subject: all have held as a maxim that nature abhors a vacuum, and almost all, going further, have maintained that she cannot permit it and that she would destroy herself sooner than suffer it. Thus opinions have been divided: some have been content to say only that she abhorred it, and others have maintained she could not suffer it. I tried in my abridgment of the *Treatise on the Vacuum* to destroy this latter opinion, and I think the experiments I give there are sufficient to make it manifestly clear that nature can and actually does suffer a space as large as we please, void of every substance known to us and perceptible to sense. I am now trying to examine the truth of the former opinion and to find experiments which will show whether the effects attributed to the horror of the vacuum should really be attributed to it, or whether they should be attributed to the weight and pressure of the air; for, to tell you frankly what I think, it is hard for me to believe that nature, which is not animate or sensitive, is capable of horror, since the passions presuppose a soul capable of feeling them, and I incline much more to impute all these effects to the weight and pressure of the air, because I consider them only as particular cases of a universal proposition on the equilibrium of fluids, which is to constitute the larger part of the treatise I have promised. Not that I did not have these same thoughts at the time I wrote my abridgment; but through lack of convincing experiments I did not then dare (and I do not yet dare) depart from the maxim of the horror of the vacuum, and I even used it as a maxim in my abridgment, having then no further design than to combat the opinion of those who maintain that the vacuum is absolutely impossible, and that nature would suffer her own destruction rather than the least void space. Indeed I do not consider it permissible for us lightly to depart from the maxims we hold from antiquity unless we are constrained by proofs indubitable and invincible. But in this case I hold it would be an extreme weakness to have the slightest scruple, and that in fine we should have more veneration for evident truths than obstinate attachment to received opinions. I could not give you better evidence of how circumspect I am before giving up ancient maxims than to remind you of the experiment I recently made in your presence with two tubes, one inside the other, which demonstrates a vacuum in a vacuum. You saw that the quicksilver in the inner tube remained suspended at the same height as in the ordinary experiment, when it was counterbalanced and pressed by the weight of the whole mass of the air, and that on the contrary it all fell down without height or suspension when because of the surrounding vacuum it was no longer at all pressed or counterbalanced by any air, which had been removed on all sides. You saw afterwards that this height or suspension of the quicksilver increased or diminished as the pressure of the air increased or diminished, and finally that all the different heights or suspensions of the quicksilver were always proportional to the pressure of the air.

Certainly after this experiment one might well be persuaded that it is not the abhorrence of a vacuum, as we suppose, which causes the suspension of the quicksilver in the ordinary experiment, but the weight and pressure of the air which counterbalances the weight of the quicksilver. But because all the effects of this last experiment with the two tubes, which are explained so naturally by the pressure and weight of the air alone, can yet be explained with some probability by the abhorrence of a vacuum, I hold to that ancient maxim, resolved however to seek the complete clearing up of this difficulty by a decisive experiment. I have thought of one which can of itself suffice to give us the light we seek if it can be carried out accurately. It is to perform the ordinary vacuum experiment several times on the same day, in the same tube, with the same quicksilver, now at the bottom and now at the top of a mountain at least 500 or 600 fathoms high, to find out whether the height of the quicksilver suspended in the tube will be the same or different in the two situations. Doubtless you already see that this experiment will decide the question, and that if it should happen that the height of the quicksilver is less at the top than at the bottom of the mountain (as I have many reasons for believing it will be, although all who have considered this matter are against me), it will follow necessarily that the weight and pressure of the air is the only cause of the quicksilver’s suspension and not the horror of the vacuum, since it is perfectly certain that there is much more air pressing down on the foot of the mountain than on its summit; whereas it could hardly be said that nature abhors a vacuum at the foot of the mountain more than at its summit.

But as great things are ordinarily found to be accompanied by difficulty, I anticipate much of it in the carrying out of this plan, which requires that an unusually high mountain be picked out near a city in which there is a person capable of bringing to this test all the necessary accuracy. For if the mountain were distant, it would be difficult to carry to it the vessels, the quicksilver, the tubes, and many other necessary things, and to undertake troublesome journeys as many times as might be required for finding on the mountain tops clear and suitable weather, which is not often met with there. And since it is as rare to find persons outside of Paris with such qualities as it is to find places satisfying the conditions, I counted myself happy on this occasion to have fallen in with both, since our town of Clermont is at the foot of the high mountain of the Puy de Dôme, and since I hope that you will grant me of your goodness the favor of being willing to make the experiment yourself. In this assurance I have led all our natural philosophers in Paris to hope that the experiment will be performed, and among others the Rev. Father Mersenne, who has already pledged himself, in letters he has written to Italy, Poland, Sweden, Holland, etc., to communicate the results to the friends he has acquired there by his merit. I do not specify the means of carrying out the experiment, because I well know that you will omit none of the circumstances necessary for doing it with precision.

Only I beg you to do it as soon as you possibly can and to excuse the liberty I am taking, which is due to my impatience to learn the outcome of the experiment, without which I cannot complete the treatise I have promised the public or satisfy

the desire of so many persons who are waiting to hear it and who will be infinitely obliged to you. Not that I wish to diminish my gratitude by the number of those who share it with me, since I want on the contrary to participate in theirs and thus remain so much the more, Sir,

Your very humble and very obedient servant,

Pascal

M. Perier received this letter at Moulins, where he was kept by the king’s business, so that however great his desire to perform the experiment promptly he was unable to do it until last September.

You will see the reasons for this delay, the account of the experiment, and the precision he brought to it, in the following letter which I had the honor of receiving from him.

> COPY OF THE LETTER OF M. PERIER TO M. PASCAL THE YOUNGER, September 22, 1648
> Sir,
>
> At last I have made the experiment you have so long been desiring. I would have given you this satisfaction sooner; I was prevented, as much by the official business I was on in Bourbonnais as because since my arrival snow or mist has so covered the Puy de Dome, on which I was to make the experiment, that even in this season, which is the finest of the year here, I had difficulty in finding a day on which it was possible to see the summit of this mountain, which is usually in the midst of clouds and sometimes above them although at the same time it is fine weather on the plain; so that my own and the season's convenience did not meet until the 19th of this month. But the success with which I performed the experiment on that day amply consoled me for the petty annoyance of so many delays I had been unable to avoid.
>
> I am sending you a full and faithful account, wherein you will see with what precision and care I performed the experiment, to which I also added the precaution of having for witnesses certain persons as learned as irreproachable, that the sincerity of their testimony might leave no doubt of the certainty of the experiment.

> Copy of the account of the experiment by M. Perier
>
> Last Saturday, the 19th of this month, was very unsettled; nevertheless since the weather seemed pretty good at 5 o'clock in the morning and the summit of the *Puy de Dome* was fully visible, I decided to ascend the mountain to make the experiment. To this end I gave notice of my intention to several persons of condition in the town of Clermont who had asked me to let them know the day when I would go up, of whom some are churchmen and others laymen. Among the churchmen were the Very Rev. Father Bannier, Minim of this city, who has several times been Superior, and M. Mosnier, Canon of the Cathedral of this city; and among the laymen, M. Laville and M. Begon, councilors on the Board of Excise, and M. La Porte, doctor of medicine and practitioner in the city, all very capable men not only in their professions but also in all good learning, with whom I was delighted to carry out this fine project. Accordingly on that day at 8 o'clock in the morning we were all together in the garden of the Minim Fathers, which is almost the lowest place in the town, where the experiment was begun as follows:
>
> First I poured into a vessel sixteen pounds of quicksilver, which I had rectified during the three preceding days; and having taken two glass tubes of the same size, each four feet long, hermetically sealed at one end and open at the other, I performed with each of them the ordinary vacuum experiment in the above mentioned vessel, and having brought the two tubes together and placed them one against the other without lifting them out of the vessel, I found that the quicksilver left in each of them was at the same level, 26 inches, 3½ lines above the surface of the quicksilver in the vessel. I did the experiment in the same place, in the same two tubes, with the same quicksilver, and in the same vessel two more times; it was always found that the quicksilver in the two tubes was at the same level and had the same height as the first time.
>
> That done, I fixed one of the tubes in its vessel as a continuous experiment. I marked on the glass the height of the quicksilver, and leaving the tube in the same place it had been, I asked the Rev. Father Chastin, one of the religious of the house, a man as pious as he is capable, who talks very well on these matters, to be at the pains of observing from time to time during the whole day whether any change came about. And with the other tube and a part of the same quicksilver I went with the above-mentioned gentlemen to perform the same experiments on the top of the *Puy de Dome*, about 500 fathoms above the Minims, where it was found that there was left in the tube only 23 inches, 2 lines of quicksilver, whereas there had been found at the Minims, in the same tube, 26 inches, 3½ lines, and that thus there was a difference of 3 inches, 1½ lines; which overcame us all with wonder and astonishment, and so surprised us that for our own satisfaction we wanted to repeat the experiment. This is why I did it five times very accurately, at different places on the summit of the mountain, now inside in the little chapel, now outside, now in a sheltered spot, now exposed to the wind, now in fine weather, now during the rain and mists which occasionally visited us, each time having very carefully eliminated all air from the tube; the quicksilver was always found to be at the same height of 23 inches, 2 lines, which when subtracted from the 26 inches, 3½ lines found at the Minims makes the difference of 3 inches, 1½ lines. Which fully satisfied us.
>
> Afterwards while descending the mountain I repeated the same experiment on the way, always with the same tube, the same quicksilver, and the same vessel, at a place called *Lafon de l'Arbre*, much higher than the Minims yet nearer to them than to the summit of the mountain; and there I found that the height of the quicksilver left in the tube was 25 inches. I did it a second time in the same place, and the said M. Mosnier, mentioned above, had the curiosity to want to perform the experiment himself. Accordingly he did it in this same place, and the same height of 25 inches was always found, which is less than that observed at the Minims by 1 inch, 3½ lines and greater than that we had just observed on top of the *Puy de Dome* by 1 inch, 10½ lines, a circumstance which increased our satisfaction not a little, since we saw that the height of the quicksilver decreased as the height of the places increased.
>
> Finally on our return to the Minims I found the vessel I had left as a continuous experiment with its quicksilver suspended at the same height at which I had left it, 26 inches, 3½ lines, in which height the Rev. Father Chastin, who had remained there to observe, reported there had been no change during the entire day, although the weather had been extremely variable, now clear, now rainy, now dank with mists, and now windy.
>
> I repeated the experiment with the tube I had taken to the *Puy de Dome*, in the same vessel with the tube of the continuous experiment; I found the quicksilver was at the same level in both tubes and at the same height of 26 inches, 3½ lines, as had been found that morning in this same tube and as it had remained the whole day in the tube of the continuous experiment.
>
> I repeated the experiment again for the last time, not only in the same tube I had used on the *Puy de Dome*, but also with the same quicksilver and in the same vessel I had carried up there, and I always found the quicksilver at the same height of 26 inches, 3½ lines which had been found in the morning. And now we were completely confirmed in the certainty of the experiment.

> The next day the Very Rev. Father Delamare, priest of the Oratory and Canon Theologian of the Cathedral, who had been present at what had taken place on the morning of the preceding day in the garden of the Minims, and to whom I had reported what had happened on the *Puy de Dome*, invited me to perform the same experiment at the foot and on top of the highest tower of *Notre Dame de Clermont* to find out if there would be a difference. To satisfy the curiosity of a man of such distinguished merit, who has given all France proofs of his ability, I performed on the same day the usual vacuum experiment in a private house, situated in the most elevated part of the city, 6 or 7 fathoms above the garden of the Minims and on a level with the foot of the tower. We found the height of the quicksilver there was about 26 inches, 3 lines, which is less than that found at the Minims by about ½ line.

This account having cleared up all my difficulties, I do not conceal the extreme satisfaction it gave me; and having seen there that a difference in elevation of 20 fathoms made a difference in the height of the quicksilver of 2 lines, and that a difference of 6 or 7 fathoms made a difference of about ½ line, differences which it was easy for me to test in this city, I performed the ordinary vacuum experiment at the top and at the bottom of the Tower of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, whose height is 24 or 25 fathoms; I found a difference of more than 2 lines in the height of the quicksilver; and afterwards I performed the experiment in a private house 90 steps up, where I found an evident difference of ½ line; results which agree perfectly with what is said in M. Perier’s account.

All students of nature can make the test for themselves at their leisure.

Many consequences can be drawn from this experiment, such as:

- A way of knowing whether two places are at the same level, that is, equidistant from the center of the earth, or which of the two has the greater altitude, however far apart they may be, even if they should be each other’s antipodes; which would be all but impossible by any other means.
- The little certainty there is in the thermometer’s indication of degrees of heat (contrary to common opinion), and that its water sometimes rises with increasing heat and sometimes falls with decreasing heat, though the thermometer has always remained in the same place.
- The unequal pressure of the air, which at the same degree of heat is always much greater in the lowest places.

All these consequences will be unfolded at length in the *Treatise on the Vacuum*, along with many others as useful as they are interesting to students.

## To the Reader

My dear reader, the universal consensus of nations and the crowd of philosophers agree in establishing the principle that nature would rather suffer her own destruction than the least void space. Some of the most enlightened minds have adopted a more moderate principle: for although they have believed that nature abhors the vacuum, they have nevertheless thought that this repugnance had limits, and that with some violence it could be overcome; but no one has yet been found to advance the third principle: that nature has no repugnance for the vacuum, that she makes no effort to avoid it, and that she admits it without difficulty and without resistance. The experiments I placed before you in my abridgment do away, in my opinion, with the first of these principles, and I do not see how the second can hold up against the present experiment; so that I no longer make any difficulty about adopting the third: that nature has no repugnance for the vacuum, that she makes no effort to avoid it, that all the effects that have been attributed to her horror have their origin in the weight and pressure of the air, that it is their sole and true cause, and that through ignorance of it this imaginary horror of the vacuum had been made to order in an attempt to account for them. It is not on this occasion only that, when the weakness of men has been unable to find the true causes, their subtlety has substituted imaginary causes, to which they have given specious names filling the ears and not the mind. Thus it is said that the sympathy and antipathy of natural bodies are efficient causes, responsible for many effects, as if inanimate bodies were capable of sympathy and antipathy; it is the same with *antiperistasis* and with many other chimerical causes, which but give a vain solace to man’s hunger to know hidden truths, and which, far from revealing them, serve only to cover up the ignorance of such inventors and to feed that of their followers.

It is not however without regret that I depart from opinions so generally received; I only do it, constrained by truth, to whose force I yield. I resisted these new views as long as I had any excuse for following the old; the maxims I made use of in my abridgment sufficiently witness that. But at last the evidence of experiments forces me to quit opinions to which respect for antiquity had held me. Accordingly I only quitted them little by little, and only gradually did I give them up, for from the first of these three principles, that nature has an invincible horror of the void, I passed to the second, that she feels horror but not invincibly; and thence I finally came to believe in the third, that nature has no horror of the void.

Thus far have I been brought by this last experiment on the equilibrium of fluids, which I would not think I had imparted to you in its entirety if I did not reveal my motives for wanting it tried; this is why I am publishing my letter of last November 15th, addressed to M. Perier, who undertook the labor of carrying out the experiment with all the accuracy and precision one could wish. It is to him alone that all those who have so long been wanting to know the results are indebted.

As by a particular good fortune this universal desire had made the experiment famous before its appearance, I am sure it will not become less celebrated after having been performed, and that it will give as much satisfaction as the expectation of it caused impatience.

It would not be right to prolong this impatience; and that is why I could not refrain from giving out the experiment in advance, against my earlier intention of not publishing it until the complete treatise (which I promised you in my abridgment), in which I shall unfold the consequences I have drawn from it and which I had put off finishing until this last experiment, because it is to complete my demonstrations. But since the treatise cannot appear at this time, I have been unwilling to withhold the experiment longer, as much to deserve more gratitude from you for being in haste as to avoid blame for the wrong I should think I was doing you by a longer delay.

Containing the explanation of the causes of divers effects of nature which had not been well understood until now and especially of those that had been attributed to the horror of the vacuum.

## TREATISE ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

### Chapter 1. That liquids weigh in proportion to their height

If we fasten to a wall several vessels, one as in the first figure, another inclined as in the second, another very wide as in the third, another narrow as in the fourth, another only a little tube ending at the bottom in a vessel which is wide but has almost no depth as in the fifth figure, and if we fill them all with water up to the same height and make openings of the same size in their bases, which we close with stoppers to keep the water in, experiment shows that the same force is required to prevent the stoppers from coming out, for although the amount of water in each vessel is entirely different, its height is the same in all; and the measure of the force required is the weight of the water contained in the first vessel, which is uniform throughout, for if this water weighs 100 pounds, a force of 100 pounds will be required to hold in each of the stoppers, even that in the fifth vessel, though the water in it should not weigh an ounce.

To make an exact test of this we must stop the opening of the fifth vessel with a round piece of wood, cased in tow like the plunger of a pump, which fits the opening and slides in it with such nicety that it does not stick and yet keeps the water in; and we must attach to the center of this piston a cord, which is then passed through the small tube and attached to one arm of a balance, on the other arm of which we hang a weight of 100 pounds; we shall find a perfect equilibrium between this 100 pound weight and the water in the small tube, weighing an ounce; and however little we take away from the 100 pounds, the weight of the water will lower the piston, and consequently lower the arm of the balance to which it is attached and lift that from which hangs the weight of a little less than 100 pounds.

If the water should freeze and the ice not stick to the vessel (as in fact it ordinarily does not), the other arm of the balance will need only an ounce to counterbalance the weight of the ice; but if we apply heat to the vessel so as to melt the ice, a weight of 100 pounds will be required to counterbalance the weight of the ice melted to water, although we are supposing it to be only an ounce.

The same thing would happen if the openings we stop were at the side or even at the top; and it would even be easier to make the test that way.

*Plate I, Figure VI*. We must have an entirely closed vessel and make two openings in the top, one very narrow, the other wider, and solder to each a tube of the same size as the opening; and we shall see that if we put a piston in the large tube and pour water in the small tube, it will be necessary to put a heavy weight on the piston to prevent the weight of the water in the small tube from pushing it up, just as in the first examples a weight of 100 pounds was required to prevent the weight of the water from pushing the pistons down, since the opening was beneath; and if it were at the side, an equal force would be required to prevent the weight of the water from pushing the piston toward that side.

And if the tube filled with water should be a hundred times wider or a hundred times narrower, provided the water were always at the same height, the same weight would always be required to counterbalance the water; and however little the weight is diminished, the water will fall and cause the diminished weight to rise.

#### Rule for the force required to make the water stand

But if we poured water in the tube to twice the height, twice the weight would be required on the piston to counterbalance the water; and similarly if we made the opening into which the piston fits twice as big, it would be necessary to double the force in order to hold down the double piston; whence we see that the force required to prevent the water from flowing out is proportional to the height of the water in the tube and not to the area of its base; and that the measure of this force is always the weight of all the water contained in a column having the height of the water in the tube and the base of the opening into which the piston fits.

What I have said of water is to be understood of every other kind of liquid.

### Chapter 2. Why liquids weigh in proportion to their height

It is seen from all these examples that a mere thread of water can counterbalance a great weight; it remains to show the cause of this multiplication of force; that is what we shall do in the following experiment.

*Plate I, Figure VII*. New kind of machine to multiply forces

If a vessel full of water, closed on all sides, has two openings, one a hundred times larger than the other, with a piston carefully fitted to each, a man pressing the small piston will match the strength of a hundred men pressing the piston in the hundredfold greater opening, and will overmaster ninety-nine.

And whatever be the ratio of the openings, if the forces applied to the pistons are as the openings, there will be equilibrium. Whence it is apparent that a vessel full of water is a new mechanical principle and a new machine for multiplying forces to any amount desired, since a man by this means will be able to lift any burden proposed.

And we must find it wonderful to meet again in this new machine that fixed order which is found in all the old machines, such as the lever, the wheel, the endless screw, etc., which is that the distance covered is increased in the same ratio as the force. For it is obvious that since one of these openings is a hundred times the other, if the man who pushes the small piston drove it down one inch, he would push the other up only the hundredth part of an inch; for since this pressure is transmitted because of the continuity of the water, which joins the two pistons and makes it impossible for one to move without pushing the other, it is obvious that when the small piston moves one inch, the water which it has pushed, pushing the other piston, since it finds this opening a hundred times greater, occupies only a hundredth part of the height, so that distance covered is to distance covered as force to force. Which can even be taken as the true cause of this effect, it being clear that to move a hundred pounds of water one inch is the same thing as to move a pound of water a hundred inches, and that thus when a pound of water is so placed with respect to a hundred pounds of water that the hundred pounds cannot move one inch without making the pound move a hundred inches, they must remain in equilibrium, one pound having as much force to make a hundred pounds move one inch as a hundred pounds have to make one pound move a hundred inches.

We can also add for greater clarity that the water under these two pistons is equally pressed; for if one piston is a hundred times heavier than the other, it is also in contact with a hundred times as many parts of water, and so each part is equally pressed; therefore all must be at rest because there is not more reason why one part should give way than another; so that if a vessel filled with water has only one opening, an inch in area, for example, in which we put a piston carrying a weight of one pound, this weight acts against all the parts of the vessel generally because of the continuity and fluidity of the water. But to determine how much of this action is felt by each part, the rule is as follows: each part an inch in area, like the opening, is acted against as if pushed by the weight of one pound (without counting the weight of the water, which I do not mention here for I am considering only the weight of the piston), because the pound weight presses the piston in the opening, and each part of the vessel, more or less great, is acted upon more or less, exactly in proportion to its size, whether this part is over against the opening or to the side, near or far, for the continuity and fluidity of the water makes all those things equal and indifferent; so that the material of which the vessel is made must have enough resistance in all its parts to hold up against all these pressures; if its resistance is anywhere less, it breaks; if it is greater, the vessel supplies what is necessary, and the rest, on this occasion, remains useless; so that if a new opening is made in the vessel, there will be required to keep the water from spurting out a force equal to the resistance this part should have, that is, a force which is to that of one pound as this new opening is to the original opening.

Here is another proof which only geometers will be able to follow, and which may be passed over by others.

I lay down as a principle that a body never moves by its own weight without downward displacement of its center of gravity. Whence I prove that the two pistons represented in *Plate I, Figure VII* are in equilibrium, as follows: for their

common center of gravity is at the point which divides the line joining their individual centers of gravity in the ratio of their weights; let them move now if possible; therefore the distances covered will be to each other inversely as the weights, as we have shown; but if we take their common center of gravity in this second position, we shall find it precisely in the same place as before; for it will always be found at the point which divides the line joining their individual centers of gravity in the ratio of their weights; therefore, because of the parallelism of the lines of their motions, it will be found at the intersection of the two lines joining the centers of gravity in the two positions; therefore the common center of gravity will be at the same point as before; therefore the two pistons, considered as a single body, have moved without any lowering of the common center of gravity, which is against the principle; therefore they cannot move; therefore they will be at rest, that is, in equilibrium. q.e.d.

## SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

By this method I have demonstrated in a little treatise on mechanics the reason for all the multiplications of forces found in all the other mechanical instruments so far invented. For I show in all of them that the unequal weights which are in equilibrium by mechanical advantage are so disposed by the construction of the machines that their common center of gravity could never descend, no matter what positions they took; whence it follows they must remain at rest, that is, in equilibrium.

Let us accept then as certainly true that if in a vessel filled with water and having openings there are forces at these openings proportional to them, the forces are in equilibrium; this is the foundation and the reason of the equilibrium of liquids, of which we are going to give several examples.

### By this new device of mechanics we understand why liquids weigh according to their height.

This device of mechanics for multiplying forces, when once understood, gives the reason why liquids weigh in accordance with their height and not in accordance with their expanse in all the effects we have recorded.

For it is obvious that in Plate I, Figure VI the water in a small tube counterpoises a piston carrying a hundred pounds because the vessel beneath is itself a vessel filled with water, having two openings, at one of which is the large piston and at the other the water in the tube, which is actually a piston carrying its own weight, which must counterbalance the other piston if their weights are as the openings.

Also in Plate I, Figure V the water in the fine tube is in equilibrium with a weight of one hundred pounds, because the vessel at the bottom, which is wide and shallow, is a closed vessel filled with water having two openings, one wide, at the bottom, where the piston is, the other small, on top, where the fine tube is, whose water is actually a piston carrying its own weight and counterbalancing the other because the weights are proportional to the openings; for it makes no difference whether the openings are opposite each other or not, as has already been said.

Wherein we see that the water of these tubes does nothing that copper pistons equally heavy would not do; since a copper piston weighing an ounce would be as much in equilibrium with the hundred pound weight as the thread of water weighing an ounce; so that the cause of the equilibrium of a small weight with a greater, as in all these examples, is not that these bodies weighing so little and yet counterpoising much heavier bodies are liquid, for that is not common to all the examples, since those in which little copper pistons counterbalance such heavy ones show the same thing; but it is that the substance in the bottom of the vessels extending from one opening to the other is liquid, for that is common to all and is the true cause of the multiplication.

Also in the example of Plate I, Figure V if the water in the little tube should freeze and that in the wide vessel beneath remained liquid, a hundred pounds would be required to sustain the weight of this ice; but if the water in the bottom freezes, whether that in the upper tube freezes or remains liquid, only an ounce is required to counterbalance it.

Whence it is clearly apparent that it is the fluidity of the body joining the two openings which causes this multiplication of forces, because its foundation is, as we have already said, that a vessel filled with water is a mechanical instrument for multiplying forces.

Let us pass to other effects whose explanation is discovered by this machine.

## EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

### Chapter 3. Examples of the equilibrium of liquids with their explanation.

Plate I, Figure VIII. If a vessel filled with water has two openings, in each of which a tube has been soldered, and if we pour water in both up to the same height, it will be in equilibrium.

For since the heights are the same, the water will be proportional to the surface, that is, to the opening; therefore the water in each tube is really a piston whose weight varies as the opening; therefore there will be equilibrium by the preceding demonstrations.

Thence it is that if we pour water in one of these tubes only, it will make the water in the other rise until the same height has been reached in both, and then there will be equilibrium; for then they will be two pistons whose weights are proportional to the openings.

### Why water rises as high as its source.

This is the reason why water rises as high as its source.

(The following experiments require that the vessel be filled up to the mouth of the tubes with the heavier of the liquids.)

But if we put different liquids in the tubes, as water in one and quicksilver in the other, the two liquids will be in equilibrium when their heights are proportional to their weights; that is to say, when the water is fourteen times higher than the quicksilver, because quicksilver as such is fourteen times heavier than water, for they will be two pistons, one of water, the other of quicksilver, whose weights will be proportional to the openings.

And even if the tube filled with water should be a hundred times finer than the tube filled with quicksilver, this thread of water would hold in equilibrium all that great mass of quicksilver, provided the water were fourteen times higher.

All that I have heretofore said of tubes should be understood of any vessel whatsoever, regular or not, for we meet with the same equilibrium; so that if, instead of the two tubes we have represented at the two openings, we should attach two vessels also emptying into these openings, but wide in some places, narrow in others, and in short entirely irregular in their whole length, and pour liquids in them until they had the specified height, these liquids would be as much in equilibrium in these irregular tubes as in the uniform tubes, because liquids weigh only according to their height and not according to their expanse.

This could easily be demonstrated by inscribing in both vessels many regular small tubes; for it would be shown by what we have demonstrated that two of these inscribed tubes, corresponding to each other, one in each vessel, are in equilibrium; therefore all those in one vessel would be in equilibrium with all those in the other. Those who are used to the inscriptions and circumscriptions of geometry will have no trouble in understanding this; and it would be very difficult to demonstrate it to others, at least geometrically.

Plate I, Figure IX. If we place in a river a tube curved back at its lower end, filled with quicksilver, in such a way that its upper end is always out of the water, the quicksilver will fall part way until it has reached a certain height, when it will fall no lower, but will remain suspended at this point, so that its height is the fourteenth part of the height of the water above the recurved end; so that if the distance from the top of the water to the recurved end is fourteen feet, the quicksilver will fall until it is only one foot higher than the recurved end, at which

## SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

height it will remain suspended; for the weight of the quicksilver which weighs inside the tube will be in equilibrium with the weight of the water weighing outside the tube, because the heights of these liquids are proportional to their weights, and their areas do not count for equilibrium; for the same reason it is also a matter of indifference whether the recurved end is wide or not and whether accordingly little or much water weighs upon it.

Also if we lower the tube, the quicksilver rises, for the weight of the water is greater; and if on the contrary we raise it, the quicksilver falls, for its weight is greater than that of the water; and if we incline the tube, the quicksilver rises until it has again reached the required height, which the inclining of the tube had diminished, for an inclined tube has less height than a vertical tube.

Plate I, Figure X. The same thing happens in a plain tube, that is, not recurved; for in such a tube open at both ends, filled with quicksilver and plunged into a river, provided that the upper end emerges from the water, if the lower end is fourteen feet from the surface, the quicksilver will fall until what is left has a height of only one foot; and there it will hang suspended by the weight of the water; which is easy to understand; for the water, in contact with the quicksilver from beneath and not from above, tries to push it up, as if it were a piston, and with so much the greater force as the water has greater depth; so that since the weight of the quicksilver makes the same effort to fall that the weight of the water makes to push it up, everything remains counterpoised.

Also if the quicksilver were not there, it is obvious that the water would enter the tube and rise to a height of fourteen feet, which is that of its level; therefore, the foot of quicksilver weighing as much as the fourteen feet of water whose place it takes, it is natural that it keep the water in the same equilibrium in which the fourteen feet of water would keep it.

But if the tube were thrust so far down in the water that the upper end was submerged, then the water would enter the tube and the quicksilver would fall; for the water weighing inside as well as outside the tube, the quicksilver would lack the necessary counterpoise for its suspension.

### Chapter 4. On the equilibrium of a liquid with a solid.

I am now going to give examples of the equilibrium of water with solid bodies, such as a cylinder of solid copper, which can be suspended in the water as follows.

Plate I, Figure XI. A very long tube is required, say twenty feet, which widens at the lower end like a funnel; if this lower end is round and has fitted into it a copper cylinder so accurately turned that it can enter and leave the opening of the funnel, sliding back and forth there without allowing any water to escape and thus acting as a piston, we shall see that if we put the funnel with the cylinder in it in a river, making sure that the end of the tube emerges from the water, and if, holding the tube with the hand, we abandon the copper cylinder to its fate, this solid cylinder will not fall, but will remain suspended because the water is in contact with it from beneath and not from above (for it cannot get into the tube); and thus the water pushes it up in the same way it pushed the quicksilver in the preceding example, making the same effort as the weight of the copper makes to fall; and thus the opposed forces are in equilibrium. To be sure, for this result the cylinder must be far enough beneath the surface of the water to give the water the depth necessary for counterbalancing the copper; so that if the cylinder is a foot

## EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

in height, there must be nine feet from the surface of the water to the bottom of the cylinder, because copper as such has nine times the weight of water; accordingly if the water is too shallow, as would be the case if the tube were drawn up toward the top of the water, the cylinder’s weight wins out and it falls; but if the tube is thrust further down than is required, say twenty feet, so far is the cylinder from being able to fall by its own weight that on the contrary we should have to employ a great force to separate it and pull it away from the funnel, for the weight of the water pushes it up with a force of twenty feet. But if we pierce the tube and the water, entering, weighs upon the cylinder from above as well as from below, then the cylinder will fall of its own weight, like the quicksilver in the other example, because it no longer has the counterweight needed for its suspension.

Plate I, Figure XII. If this tube which we have just described is curved over and a wooden cylinder is introduced and the whole is put into water, but in such a way that the upper end emerges, the wood will not rise, although it is surrounded by water, but on the contrary it will sink down into the tube because the water is in contact with it from above and not from below; for the water cannot enter the tube, and thus it pushes the cylinder down with all its weight and not at all up, for it is not in contact with it from below.

Plate I, Figure XIII. But if the cylinder were flush with the water, that is, if it were only sunk in such a way that there was no water above it but also none of it above the water, then it would be pushed neither up nor down by the weight of the water, which would be in contact with it neither from above nor from below (since it cannot enter the tube), but only on all sides; accordingly the cylinder would not rise for nothing lifts it, and on the contrary it would fall, but by its own weight only.

But if the lower end of the tube were bent to one side like a crutch and a cylinder were put in and the whole immersed, still in such a way that the upper end is out of the water, the weight of the water will push the cylinder laterally into the tube, because the water is not in contact with it on the opposite side, and the water will act in this way with so much the more force as it has more depth.

### Chapter 5. Of bodies entirely immersed in water.

Plate I, Figure XV. We see from the above that water pushes up bodies it is in contact with from below, that it pushes down those it is in contact with from above, and that it pushes to one side those it is in contact with on the opposite side; whence it is easily concluded that when a body is entirely immersed in water, since the water is in contact with it from above, from below, and on every side, it tries to push it up, down, and sideways in every direction; but since its depth is the measure of the force it exerts in all these efforts, it is easy to see which of them must prevail.

For it is apparent at once that since the water has the same depth with respect to all the lateral surfaces, it will push them equally; and accordingly the body will receive no lateral impulsion in any direction, any more than a weathervane between two winds of equal strength. But since the water is deeper at the lower surface of the body than at the upper, it is obvious that it will push it more up than down, and since the difference between the two levels of the water is the height of the body itself, it is easy to understand that the water pushes it more

## SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

up than down with a force equal to the weight of a volume of water equal to the body.

### A body in water is counterpoised by an equal volume of water.

So that a body in water is carried there as if in the pan of a balance whose other pan carried an equal volume of water.

### Hence it comes about that some bodies sink.

Whence it is apparent that if the body is of copper or some other substance heavier than an equal volume of water, it sinks; for its weight wins out against that counterbalancing it.

### Others rise.

If the body is of wood or some other substance lighter than an equal volume of water, it rises with as much force as its weight is exceeded by the weight of water.

### Others neither rise nor sink.

And if the body has the same weight as water, it neither sinks nor rises, like wax, which stays in water almost where it is put.

This is the reason why a well bucket is not hard to pull up so long as it is in the water, and why we do not feel its weight until it begins to come out, just as a bucket filled with wax would not be more difficult to pull up while it was in the water; but when they are in the water, they have a counterpoise which they no longer have when they have been drawn out, just as a balance pan carrying a hundred pounds is not hard to lift if the other pan is equally laden.

### Copper weighs more in air than in water.

This is why when copper is in water we find that it is less heavy precisely by the weight of a volume of water equal to its own; so that if it weighs nine pounds in air, it weighs but eight in water because the equal volume of water counterbalancing it weighs a pound; and in sea water it weighs less because sea water is almost one forty-fifth heavier.

### Two bodies which are in equilibrium in air are not in equilibrium in water.

For the same reason two bodies, one copper, the other lead, of equal weight and consequently of different volume (since the same weight requires more copper), will be found to balance each other in the scales; but if the scales are put in water, the equilibrium is lost, for each body being counterbalanced by a volume of water equal to its own, and the volume of the copper being greater than that of the lead, the copper has a greater counterpoise, and accordingly the weight of the lead is the master.

### Nor even in moist air.

Thus two weights of different material having been perfectly balanced with the greatest precision to which men can attain, if they are in equilibrium when the air is very dry, they are no longer so when the air is moist.

### All bodies in water are pushed up by its weight, not down.

By the same principle when a man is in water, so far is the weight of the water from pushing him down that on the contrary it pushes him up, but he weighs more than it; and that is why he nonetheless goes down, but with much less violence than in air because he is counterpoised by a volume of water equal to his own, which weighs almost as much as he does; and if it weighed the same, he would float. And so by kicking the ground or making the slightest effort against the water, he rises and floats; and in mud baths a man could not sink, and if he is pushed down, he rises of himself.

## EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

For the same reason a man bathing in a tub lifts his arm without effort as long as it is in the water; but when he thrusts it out of the water, he feels that it is heavy because it is no longer counterbalanced by a volume of water equal to its own, as it was in the water.

### How it is that bodies float.

Finally bodies which float on the water weigh exactly as much as the water whose place they occupy; for the water, in contact with them from below and not from above, only pushes them up.

And this is why a lead plate convex in shape floats, because it occupies a large place in the water because of this shape; whereas if it were a solid mass, it would never occupy more than the place of a volume of water equal to the volume of its matter, which would not suffice to balance it.

### Chapter 6. On compressible bodies in water.

It is seen from everything I have shown how water acts against all bodies in it, pressing them on every side; whence it is easy to judge that if a compressible body is submerged, the water should compress it inward toward the center; and that is exactly what it does, as will be seen in the following examples.

Plate I, Figure XIV. If a bellows with a very long tube, say twenty feet, is placed in water in such a way that the nozzle emerges, it will be hard to open, if the little holes which are in one of the wings have been stopped, whereas it would be opened without any trouble if it were in the air, because the water compresses it from every side with its weight; but if all the necessary force is employed and it is opened, however little this force is relaxed, the bellows closes again with violence (whereas it would remain wide open if it were in air) because of the weight of the mass of water pressing against it. Also the deeper it is in the water the more difficult it is to open because there is a greater depth of water to support.

Plate I, Figure XVI. Similarly if we put a tube in the opening of a balloon and bind the balloon about the end of the tube, which is twenty feet long, pouring quicksilver in the tube until the balloon is full and putting the entire apparatus in a cistern of water, so that the end of the tube emerges from the water, we shall see the quicksilver rise from the balloon into the tube, up to a certain height, because since the weight of the water presses the balloon from all sides, the quicksilver it contains, being pressed equally at every point except where the tube enters (for the water has no access there since the mouth of the tube is above the surface of the water), is pushed from the places where it is pressed toward the place where it is not pressed; and thus it rises in the tube up to a certain height at which it weighs as much as the water outside the tube.

Wherein the same thing happens as if we pressed the balloon between the hands; for we should without difficulty make the liquid in it rise in the tube, and it is obvious that the surrounding water presses it in the same way.

Plate I, Figure XVII. It is for the same reason that if a man puts the end of a glass tube twenty feet long on his thigh, and if, holding it there, he seats himself in a tank filled with water so that the upper end of the tube emerges from the water, his flesh will swell where the mouth of the tube is and a large and painful tumor will be formed, as if the flesh were sucked and drawn by a cupping glass; because the weight of the water compressing his body from all sides except the place where the mouth of the tube is (which the water cannot reach because the

## SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

tube, into which it cannot enter, prevents its getting there), the flesh is pushed from the places where it is compressed to the place where it is not; and the greater the depth of water, the larger the swelling, and when the water is withdrawn, the swelling goes down; and similarly if water is poured into the tube, for the weight of the water affecting this part of the body as well as the others, there is no more swelling there than elsewhere.

This effect is perfectly conformable to the preceding one, for the quicksilver in the one case and the man’s flesh in the other, since they are everywhere pressed except at the mouth of the tube, are pushed into the tube as much as the force of the water’s weight can push them.

If we put in the bottom of a tank filled with water a balloon in which the air is not under much pressure, we shall see that it will be noticeably compressed; and in proportion as the water is removed, the balloon will gradually expand, because the weight of the mass of the water which is above it presses it on all sides toward the center, until the spring of this compressed air is as strong as the weight of the water pressing the balloon.

If we put at the bottom of the same tank of water a balloon filled with air at high pressure, we shall not notice any compression; not that the water does not press it; for the contrary is apparent from the other balloon and from the one containing quicksilver, from the bellows and from all the other examples, but the water has not enough force to compress it noticeably, because it was already very much compressed; just as when a spring is very stiff, like that of a crossbow, it cannot be noticeably bent by a moderate force which would bend a weaker spring perfectly noticeably.

We must not be surprised that the weight of the water does not noticeably compress this balloon and that nevertheless we very considerably compress it merely by laying our finger on it, although we press it then with a force less than that of water. The reason for this difference is that when the balloon is in the water, the water presses it on all sides, whereas when we press it with the finger, it is pressed in one place only; but when we press it with the finger in one place only, we make a large dent inasmuch as the neighboring parts are not pressed and thus easily accommodate what is expelled from the part that is pressed; so that since the matter driven from the one place that is pressed is distributed to all the rest, each place has little to take care of; and thus there is a dent in that place which becomes very noticeable by comparison with all the surrounding parts, which are without it.

But if we succeeded in pressing all the other parts as well as that one, each part giving back what it had received from the first, the first would return to its original state because the rest would themselves be pressed as well as it; and as there would now be only a general compression of all parts towards the center, we should no longer see a compression in any particular place; and we should not be able to judge of the general compression except by a comparison of the two spaces occupied by the balloon; and as they would differ very little, it would be impossible to notice it. Whence we see how much difference there is between pressing one part only and pressing all the parts generally.

It is the same with a body every part of which is pressed save one; for a swelling occurs there from the emptying, as it were, of the others, as could be seen in the example of the man in the water with a tube on his thigh. Also if we press the

## EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

same balloon between the hands, although we try to touch each of its parts, there will always be one which escapes between the fingers and swells out into a tumor; but if it were possible to press the balloon everywhere equally, we should never be able noticeably to compress it, whatever effort we made, provided the air in the balloon were already under considerable pressure; this is what happens when it is in the water, for the water is in contact with it on all sides.

### Chapter 7. Of animals in water. Why they are not noticeably compressed by the weight of the water.

All this reveals to us why water does not compress the animals in it, although it presses generally all bodies it surrounds, as we have shown by so many examples. For it is not that the water does not press them but as we have already said, since it is in contact with them on all sides, it can cause neither swelling nor depression in any particular part but only a general condensation of all the parts toward the center, which would not be noticeable unless great and which can only be extremely slight because flesh is very compact.

For if the water were in contact with a body in one part only or if it were in contact with it in all but one, provided the body were at a considerable depth, the result would be very noticeable, as we have shown; but since all parts are equally pressed, nothing is seen.

Why the weight of the water is not felt.

It is easy to pass from this to the reason why animals in water do not feel its weight.

For the pain we feel when something presses us is great if the compression is great; because the part compressed is drained of blood, and the flesh, the nerves, and the other parts composing it are pushed out of their natural place, and this violence cannot occur without pain. But if the compression is slight, as when the skin is grazed by the finger with such delicacy that the blood is not driven from the part touched and that neither the flesh nor the nerves are displaced or in any way altered, there can also be no sensible pain; and if we are touched in this way in every part of the body, we should feel no pain from so slight a compression.

And this is what happens to animals in water; for the weight compresses them, to be sure, but so little that it is by no means noticeable, for the reason we have given; so that no part being pressed or drained of blood, no nerve or vein or fleshy part being displaced (for since the whole body is equally pressed, there is no more reason why they should be pressed toward one part than toward another) and everything remaining in short without change, everything should remain without pain and without awareness.

And we should not be surprised that these animals do not feel the weight of the water and that nevertheless they would certainly feel the weight of our finger if we only rested it on them, although they were thereby pressed with less force than by the water; for the reason for this difference is that when they are in water, they are pressed on all sides generally, whereas when they are pressed with the finger, they are pressed in one place only. But we have shown that this difference is the reason why they are quite noticeably compressed by the tip of the finger and are not noticeably compressed by the weight of the water, even if it should be increased a hundredfold; and as sensation is always proportional to compression, this difference is the reason why animals feel the pressure of the finger and not the weight of the water.

And thus the true reason why animals in water do not feel its weight is that they are equally pressed from all sides.

Also if we put a worm in dough, even though we should press the dough between our hands, we could never crush the worm or even injure it or compress it, because we would be pressing it in all its parts. The following experiment will serve as proof. We must have a glass tube, closed at the lower end and half filled with water, into which we put three things: a little balloon half filled with air, a second balloon entirely filled with air, and a fly (for it lives in lukewarm water as well as in air); and we must put a piston into the tube which will go as far as the water. If we press the piston with whatever force we like, as by putting a large number of weights on top of it, the water thus pressed will press everything it contains; accordingly the soft balloon will be quite noticeably compressed, but the hard balloon will be no more compressed than if there were nothing pressing it, nor the fly either, which will feel no pain under this great weight; for we shall see it, free and lively, walking along the glass and even flying away as soon as it is released from this prison.

No special brilliance is needed to draw out of this experiment everything we had already demonstrated.

We see the weight presses all these bodies as much as it can.

We see that it compresses the soft balloon; consequently it also presses the one beside it, for the same reason holds for both. But we see that no compression appears.

Whence then comes this difference? Whence could it come except from the single thing in which the two balloons differ, which is that one is filled with compressed air, which has been forcibly pumped into it, whereas the other is only half full; and thus the slack air which is in one is capable of great compression, but not the air in the other, because it is very compact and the water which presses it, surrounding it on all sides, can make no perceptible impression on the balloon, which makes an arch against it on all sides?

We also see that the fly is not compressed. Why, except for the same reason the balloon filled with air is not? And finally we see it feels no pain for the same reason.

But if we put dough instead of water in the bottom of the tube, and the balloon and the fly in the dough, and put the piston on top and pressed it, the same thing would happen.

Therefore since the condition of being pressed on all sides makes it impossible for the compression to be either noticeable or painful, must we not agree that this is the sole reason why the weight of the water cannot be felt by animals in it?

Let it no longer be said then that the reason is that water does not weigh upon itself, for it weighs everywhere the same; or that it weighs in a different fashion from solid bodies, for all weights are of the same nature; and here is a solid weight that a fly supports without feeling it.

And if anyone is still not satisfied, let the piston be removed and let water be poured into the tube until the water taking the piston’s place weighs as much as the piston itself; it cannot be doubted that the fly will no more feel the weight of the water than that of the piston. Whence comes then this insensibility to so great a weight in these two examples? Is it because the weight is water? No, for when the weight is solid, there is the same insensibility. Let us say then that it is only because the fly is surrounded by water, for that alone is common to the two examples; accordingly it is the true reason.

Also if it happened that all the water above the fly should freeze, provided there was left a little above it unfrozen and that thus it was entirely surrounded by water, it would no more feel the weight of this ice than it did the weight of the water before.

And if all the water in the river should freeze except for about a foot at the bottom, the fish swimming there would no more feel the weight of that ice than the weight of the water into which it would later melt.

And thus animals in water do not feel its weight, not because it is only water that weighs down on them but because it is water that surrounds them.

## TREATISE ON THE WEIGHT OF THE MASS OF THE AIR

### Chapter 1. That the mass of the air has weight, and that it presses with its weight all the bodies it surrounds.

No one denies today that the air is heavy. We know that a balloon weighs more when inflated than when empty, which is sufficient proof; for if the air were light, the more of it we put in the balloon the more levity the whole would have, for the whole would have more than a part would have; but since on the contrary the more air we put in the heavier the whole is, it follows that each part is itself heavy and consequently that the air is heavy.

Those who want longer proofs have only to look them up in the authors who have expressly dealt with this matter.

If it be objected that air is light when it is pure but that the air which surrounds us is not pure air because it is mixed with vapors and gross bodies, and that it is only because of these foreign bodies that it is heavy, I reply in a word that I do not know pure air and that it might be hard to find; but I speak in this treatise only of the air as it exists in the state in which we breathe it, without considering whether it be composite or not; and it is that body, simple or composite, which I call air and of which I say that it is heavy: a fact which cannot be denied, and that is all I require in what follows.

This principle laid down, I shall stop only to draw certain consequences.

1.  Since each part of the air is heavy, it follows that the whole mass of the air (that is, the whole sphere of the air) is heavy; and since the sphere of the air is not infinite in its extent, since it has limits, so also the weight of the mass of all the air is not infinite.
2.  Just as the mass of the water of the sea presses with its weight the earth beneath it, and just as, if it covered the whole earth instead of a part of it only, it would press with its weight the whole surface of the earth; so since the mass of the air covers the entire surface of the earth, this weight presses its every part.
3.  Just as the bottom of a bucket containing water is more pressed by the weight of the water when the bucket is full than when it is half full, and is the more pressed the deeper the water; so high places like mountain tops are not so pressed by the weight of the mass of the air as are low places like valleys, because there is more air above the valleys than above the mountain tops; for all the air alongside the mountain weighs on the valley and not on the summit, because it is above the one and below the other.
4.  Just as bodies in water are pressed on all sides by the weight of the water above, as I have shown in the *Treatise on the equilibrium of liquids*, so bodies in the air are pressed on all sides by the weight of the mass of the air above.
5.  As animals in water do not feel its weight, so for the same reason we do not feel the weight of the air; and as we could not conclude that water has no weight from our not feeling it when we are immersed in it, so we cannot conclude that air is not heavy because we do not feel it to be so. We have shown the reason for this in the *Equilibrium of liquids*.
6.  Just as if we had got together a great heap of wool twenty or thirty fathoms high, this mass would be compressed by its own weight, and the bottom part would be much more compressed than the middle part or the part near the top because it would be pressed by a greater amount of wool; so the mass of the air, which like wool is a compressible and heavy body, is compressed by its own weight; and the air on the bottom, that is, in low-lying places, is much more compressed than that higher up, as on mountain tops, because it carries a greater weight of air.
7.  Just as if we took a handful of that mass of wool from the bottom in its compressed state and keeping it still compressed in the same way, put it in the middle of the mass, it would of itself increase in size since it was nearer the top, because it would have to carry the weight of a lesser amount of wool there; so if we contrived in some way to take air, as it is down here and compressed as it is, to the top of a mountain, it would have to increase in size of itself and attain to the condition of the air surrounding it on the mountain top, because it would carry a lesser weight of air in this place than below. Consequently if we took a balloon only half filled with air, and not entirely inflated as they usually are, and carried it up a mountain, it should be more inflated on the mountain top and should increase in size in proportion to its being less pressed; and the difference should be perceptible if the weight of the quantity of air alongside the mountain from which it is freed is considerable enough to cause a sensible effect and difference.

These consequences are so necessarily bound up with their principle that the one cannot be true without the others being equally so; and since it is certain that the air reaching from the earth to the top of its sphere has weight, all our conclusions therefrom are equally true.

But however certain we find these conclusions, it seems to me that everyone, even though accepting them, would want to see the last consequence confirmed by experiment, because it contains both all the rest and its own principle; for it is certain that if we saw a balloon, as described above, expand as it is carried higher, we could not possibly doubt that this expansion came from the fact that the air in the balloon was more pressed below than above, since there is nothing else that could cause it to expand, it being even colder on the mountain tops than in the valleys; and this compression of the air in the balloon could have no other cause than the weight of the mass of the air, for the air was taken as it was in the low altitude and was not compressed, since the balloon was even soft and only half filled. Consequently this would absolutely prove that the air is heavy; that the mass of the air is heavy; that it presses with its weight all the bodies it surrounds; that it presses low-lying places more than high places; that it is itself compressed by its own weight; that the air is more compressed below than above. And since in physics experiments have much more force of persuasion than arguments have, I do not doubt that everyone would want to see the latter confirmed by the former.

But if the experiment were made, I should have this advantage that in case there occurred no difference in the inflation of the balloon on the highest mountains, that would not invalidate my conclusion, because I could say they are not yet sufficiently high to cause a perceptible difference; whereas if there should be a very considerable difference, as of one-eighth or one-ninth, certainly the experiment would be decisive in my favor, and there could no longer be any doubt of the truth of everything I have established.

But I must say at once without further delay that the test has been made, and successfully, as follows.

**Experiment made in two places, differing in altitude by about 500 fathoms.**

If we take a balloon half filled with air, flaccid and soft, and carry it at the end of a string up a mountain 500 fathoms high, it will expand of itself as we go up, and when we are at the top, it will be entirely full and rounded out as if we had blown in more air; and as we go down again, it will little by little lose its roundness, passing through the same degrees, so that when we reach the bottom, the balloon will have returned to its original state.

This experiment proves conclusively everything I have said about the mass of the air; and it was necessary to establish that firmly, since it is the foundation of the whole discourse.

It only remains to point out that the mass of the air is heavier at one time than at another, namely, when it carries more vapor or is more compressed by cold.

Let us observe then,
1.  that the mass of the air is heavy;
2.  that its weight is limited;
3.  that it is heavier at one time than at another;
4.  that it is heavier in certain places than in others, as in valleys;
5.  that it presses with its weight all the bodies it surrounds, and presses the more the heavier it is.

### Chapter 2. That the weight of the mass of the air produces all the effects hitherto attributed to the horror of a vacuum.

This chapter is divided into two sections: in the first is an account of the principal effects attributed to the horror of the vacuum; and in the second it is shown that they come from the weight of the air.

#### First Section. Account of the effects attributed to the horror of a vacuum.

There are certain effects which it is claimed nature produces because of her horror of a vacuum. The chief are:

1.  It is hard to open a bellows whose apertures have been carefully stopped; and if we try to do it, we feel resistance as if its sides were glued together. And the piston of a sealed syringe resists when we try to pull it up, as if it were stuck to the bottom.
    > It is claimed that this resistance comes from nature's horror of the vacuum which would be made in the bellows if it could be opened up; which is confirmed by the fact that the resistance ceases as soon as the stoppers are removed and the air can get in to fill the bellows when it is opened.
2.  Two polished bodies when placed together are hard to separate and seem to adhere.
    Similarly a hat when put on a table is hard to snatch up.
    Similarly a piece of leather when put on a paving stone and suddenly lifted, loosens and lifts up the stone.
    > It is claimed that this adhesion comes from nature's horror of the vacuum which would exist during the time it would take the air to get from the edges to the center.
3.  When a syringe is dipped in water, if the piston is pulled up, the water follows and rises as if it adhered to the piston.
    Similarly the water rises in a suction pump, which is actually nothing but a long syringe, and follows the piston when it is lifted, as if it adhered to it.
    > It is claimed that the rising of the water comes from nature's horror of the vacuum which would be made in the place left by the piston if the water did not rise, because the air cannot get in; which is confirmed by this, that if holes are made through which the air can get in, the water no longer rises.
    In the same way if we put the nozzle of a bellows in water and suddenly open the bellows, the water rises to fill it because the air cannot get in, and especially if we stop the air holes in the wing.
    Similarly when we put our mouth in water and suck, we draw up the water for the same reason; for the lungs are like a bellows, of which the mouth would be the nozzle.
    Similarly in breathing we draw in the air as a bellows in opening draws in the air to fill up its capacity.
    Similarly when we put lighted wicks in a saucer filled with water and a glass over them, as the flame of the wicks dies down, the water rises in the glass because the air in the glass, which had been rarefied by the flame, is now condensed by the cold and draws the water up and makes it rise along with itself as it contracts, in order to fill the place it is leaving; just as the piston of a syringe draws the water up with it when we lift it.
    Similarly cupping glasses draw the flesh and cause a swelling, because the air inside the glass, rarefied by the candle flame, is now condensed by the cold when the flame is extinguished and draws the flesh with it to fill the place it leaves, as it drew the water in the preceding example.
4.  If we put a bottle filled with water mouth down in a vessel filled with water, the water in the bottle remains suspended without falling.
    > It is claimed that the water does not fall because of nature's horror of the vacuum which would be made in the place left by the water in falling, for the air could not get in; this explanation is confirmed by the fact that if a hole is made through which the air can get in, all the water falls immediately.
    We can make the same test with a tube, ten feet long say, stopped at the upper end and open at the bottom; for if it is filled with water and the lower end is dipped in a vessel of water, all the water in the tube remains suspended, whereas it would fall at once if the top of the tube had been opened.
    We can do the same thing with a like tube, stopped at the top and recurved at the bottom, without putting it in a vessel of water as was done with the other one; for if it is filled with water, this water too will remain suspended, whereas if the top were opened, the water would at once spurt out with violence from the recurved end as from a fountain.
    Finally the same thing can be done with a plain tube, without its being recurved, provided it be very narrow at the bottom; for if it is stopped at the top, the water will remain suspended, whereas it would fall with violence if we opened the upper end.
    It is for the same reason that a cask filled with wine does not give up a drop of it, though the spigot be open, unless we make an opening in the top to admit air.
5.  If we fill with water a tube in the shape of an inverted crescent (which is ordinarily called a siphon), and let each leg dip in a vessel filled with water, then unless the two vessels are at exactly the same level, all the water in the higher vessel will rise in the leg dipping in it to the top of the siphon and will pass through the other leg into the lower vessel; so that if water is constantly supplied to the higher vessel, the flow will be continuous.
    > It is claimed that this rising of the water comes from nature's horror of the vacuum which would be made in the siphon if the water in the two legs fell from each into the corresponding vessels, as it actually does fall when an opening is made in the top of the siphon through which the air can get in.

There are several other like effects I omit because they are all similar to those of which I have spoken and because in all there appears only this, that all the contiguous bodies resist the effort made to separate them when air cannot get in between them, whether this effort comes from their own weight, as in the examples in which water rises and remains suspended in spite of its weight, or whether it comes from forces we use to separate them, as in the first examples.

These are the effects commonly attributed to the horror of the vacuum; I am going to show that they come from the weight of the air.

#### Second Section. That the weight of the mass of the air produces all the effects that have been attributed to the horror of the vacuum.

If we have clearly understood in the *Treatise on the equilibrium of liquids* how liquids act with their weight against all bodies in them, we shall have no difficulty in understanding how the weight of the mass of air, acting upon all bodies, produces all the effects that had been attributed to the horror of the vacuum, for they are exactly alike, as we shall show in each instance.

1.  That the weight of the mass of the air causes the difficulty in opening a bellows with all its apertures stopped.

That it may be understood how the weight of the mass of the air causes the difficulty we experience in opening a bellows when the air cannot get in, I shall point out a like resistance caused by the weight of water. All that is needed is to recall what I said in the *Equilibrium of liquids* (*Plate I, Figure XIV*), that a bellows with a tube of twenty feet or more, placed in a tank of water in such a way that the end of the tube emerges from the water, is hard to open, and so much the harder as the water is deeper; which comes obviously from the weight of the water above, for when there is no water, the bellows opens very easily; and in proportion as water is poured in, the resistance increases and is always equal to the weight of the water carried by the bellows, because since the water cannot get in because the tube is outside, we could not open the bellows without lifting and holding up the whole mass of the water; for the water displaced by opening the bellows, not being able to enter it, is forced to go elsewhere and thus to raise the level of the water, which cannot be done without effort; whereas if the bellows were broken and the water could get in, we could open and close it without resistance because the water would go in through the breaks as fast as the bellows was opened, and so we could open it without having to lift up the water.

I do not think anyone will be tempted to say that this resistance comes from the horror of the vacuum, and it is absolutely certain that it comes from the weight of the water alone.

But what I say of water should be understood of any other fluid; for if we put the bellows in a tank filled with wine, we shall feel a like resistance to opening it, and likewise if we put it in milk, in oil, in quicksilver, and in short in any fluid whatsoever. It is then a general rule and a necessary effect of the weight of fluids: that if a bellows is put in any fluid whatsoever in such a way that it cannot get into the body of the bellows, the weight of the fluid above prevents our opening the bellows without feeling resistance, because we could not do it without holding up the fluid; and consequently, applying this general rule to the particular case of the air, it will be true that when the air is kept from entering a bellows, the weight of the mass of the air above prevents our opening the bellows without feeling resistance, because we could not open it without lifting the whole mass of the air; but as soon as we make an opening in it, we open and close it without resistance because the air can get in and out, and so when we open the bellows, we do not have to lift the mass of the air; which is entirely conformable to the example of the bellows in water.

Whence we see that the difficulty in opening a sealed bellows is only a particular case of the general rule concerning the difficulty of opening a bellows in any fluid whatsoever when the fluid has no access to it.

What I have said of this effect I shall say of each of the others, but more succinctly.

2.  That the weight of the mass of the air is the cause of the difficulty we experience in separating two polished bodies when placed together.

That it may be understood how the weight of the mass of the air causes the resistance we feel when we want to separate two polished bodies that have been placed together, I shall give an example of an altogether similar resistance caused by the weight of the water, which will leave no room for doubt that the air causes this effect.

We must here again recall what was set forth in the *Equilibrium of liquids* (*Plate I, Figure XI*):

That if we put a copper cylinder, turned on a lathe, in the opening of a funnel, also turned on a lathe, so that they fit so perfectly that the cylinder easily enters and slides back and forth in the funnel but without letting any water escape between, and if we put this machine in a tank of water in such a way that the stem of the funnel emerges from the water (which stem may have a length of twenty feet if necessary); if with the cylinder at a depth of fifteen feet in the water, holding the funnel with the hand, we let loose the cylinder and abandon it to its fate, we shall see that not only will it not fall although it seems there is nothing to hold it up, but even that it will be difficult to pull it out of the funnel although it is in no way stuck to it; whereas it would fall by its own weight with violence if it were at a depth of only four feet in the water, and still more violently if it were entirely outside the water. I have also shown the reason for this, which is that the water, in contact with the cylinder from below and not from above (for it does not touch its upper surface because the funnel keeps it from getting there), pushes it from the side it touches toward the side it does not touch, and thus pushes it up and presses it against the funnel.

The same thing should be understood of every other fluid; and consequently

if two bodies are polished and placed together and if we hold the upper one with the hand and let the other go, the lower one remains suspended because the air is in contact with it from beneath and not from above, for it cannot get in between the two bodies and consequently it cannot reach the surfaces in contact; whence it follows by a necessary effect of the weight of all fluids in general that the weight of the air must push this body up and press it against the other, so that if we try to separate them, we meet with great resistance; which is entirely conformable to the effect of the weight of water.

Whence we see that the difficulty in separating two polished bodies is only a particular case of the general rule concerning the pressure of all fluids in general when they are in contact with a body on one of its surfaces and not on the opposite surface.

### 3. That the weight of the mass of the air is the cause of the rise of water in syringes and pumps.

To explain how the weight of the mass of the air makes water rise in pumps as the plunger is lifted, I shall show an entirely similar effect of the weight of water, which will make the reason perfectly clear as follows:

If we fit a syringe with a long piston, ten feet say, hollow throughout its length, with a valve at the lower end so arranged that it opens downward but not upward, so that the syringe is incapable of lifting water or any liquid above the level of the liquid because the air can enter it perfectly freely through the hollow piston; if now we put the opening of the syringe in a vessel filled with quicksilver and the whole in a tank of water in such a way that the top of the piston emerges from the water, when we lift the piston, the quicksilver will rise and follow it as if it adhered to it; whereas it would not rise at all if there were no water in the tank, because the air is entirely free to enter the body of the syringe through the hollow piston.

So the fear of the vacuum is not the cause; for if the quicksilver did not rise to fill the place left by the piston, there would be no vacuum since the air may freely enter; but it is only because the mass of the water weighing upon the quicksilver in the vessel and pressing it in all its parts except where the opening of the syringe is (for the water cannot reach there since it is kept away by the body of the syringe and by the piston), the quicksilver, pressed in every place but one, is pushed by the weight of the water toward that one as soon as the piston by being lifted leaves it a free place to enter, and balances in the syringe the weight of the water which weighs on the quicksilver outside.

But if holes are made in the syringe so the water can get in, the quicksilver will no longer rise because the water enters and is as much in contact with the quicksilver at the mouth of the syringe as elsewhere, and thus since all of it is equally pressed, none of it rises. All this was clearly demonstrated in the *Equilibrium of liquids*.

We see in this example how the weight of the water makes the quicksilver rise; and we could produce a similar effect with the weight of sand by removing the water from the tank; if instead of water we pour in sand, the weight of the sand will make the quicksilver rise in the syringe because it presses, just as the water did, everywhere except at the mouth of the syringe, and thus it pushes the quicksilver and forces it to rise in the syringe.

And if we put our hands on the sand and press it, we shall make the quicksilver rise higher inside the syringe and keep on rising to a height at which it can counterpoise the pressure outside.

The explanation of these effects makes it very easy to understand why the weight of the air causes water to rise in ordinary syringes as the piston is drawn up; for since the air is in contact with the water in the vessel everywhere except at the opening of the syringe (from which it is kept away by the syringe and the piston), it is obvious that the weight of the air, pressing the water in every place but that one, must push it thither and make it rise, as the piston by being lifted leaves room for it to come in, and counterbalance within the syringe the weight of the air which weighs outside, for the same reason and by the same necessity as the quicksilver rose, pressed by the weight of the water and by the weight of the sand, in the example we have just given.

It is then obvious that the rising of water in syringes is only a particular case of the general rule that when a fluid is pressed in every place but one by the weight of some other fluid, this weight pushes it toward the place where it is not being pressed.

### 4. That the weight of the mass of the air causes water to be suspended in tubes stopped at the upper end.

To make it understood how the weight of the air holds water suspended in tubes stopped at the upper end, I shall point out an entirely similar example of a like suspension caused by the weight of water, which will make the reason perfectly clear.

And first it may be said at once that this effect is entirely comprehended in the preceding; for just as I have shown that the weight of the air makes water rise in syringes and holds it suspended there, so the same weight of the air holds water suspended in a tube. That this effect may not lack, any more than the rest, another entirely like it to which it may be compared, I shall say that nothing is needed to this end but to remember what was said in the *Equilibrium of liquids* (*Plate I, Figure IX*), namely, that a tube ten feet long or more, recurved at the bottom and filled with quicksilver, having been put in a tank of water so that the upper end emerges from the water, part of the quicksilver remains suspended inside the tube, that is, at the height where it can counterbalance the water which weighs outside; and that a like suspension takes place even in a tube not recurved, simply open at both ends, with the upper end emerging from the water.

Now it is obvious that this suspension does not come from the horror of a vacuum, but only from this, that the water, weighing outside and not inside the tube and in contact with the quicksilver on one side and not on the other, holds it suspended by its weight at a certain height; therefore if the tube is pierced so that the water can get in, straightway all the quicksilver falls, because since the water is in contact with it everywhere and acting within as well as without, the quicksilver no longer has a counterpoise. All this was said in the *Equilibrium of liquids*.

Since this is a necessary effect of the equilibrium of fluids, it is not strange that when a tube is filled with water, stopped at the top and recurved at the bottom, the water remains suspended in it; for the air, weighing on the part of the water at the recurved end and not on the part in the tube (since it is prevented by the stopper), must of necessity hold the water suspended inside to counterbalance its own weight outside, exactly as the weight of the water held the quicksilver in equilibrium in the example we just gave.

And similarly when the tube is not recurved; for because the air is in contact with the water from below and not from above (since the stopper prevents contact there), it is absolutely necessary that the weight of the air hold up the water, exactly as the water held up the quicksilver in the example just given, and as the water pushes up and holds suspended a copper cylinder it is in contact with from below and not from above; but if the stopper is removed, the water falls, for the air is in contact with the water below and above and weighs inside and outside the tube.

Whence we see that the action of the air in holding liquids suspended with which it is in contact on one side and not on the other is a case of the general rule that fluids contained in any kind of tube whatsoever, immersed in another fluid which presses them from one side and not from the other, are suspended by the equilibrium of the fluids.

### 5. That the weight of the mass of the air makes water rise in siphons.

To explain how the weight of the air makes water rise in siphons I am going to show that the weight of water makes quicksilver rise in a siphon open at the top so that it is freely accessible to the air; whence we shall see how the weight of the air produces this effect. This I shall do as follows.

If one leg of a siphon is about one foot high and the other about one foot, one inch, and if we make an opening in the top of the siphon in which we insert a tube twenty feet long and carefully soldered to the opening, and if, having filled the siphon with quicksilver, we put each of its legs in a vessel also filled with quicksilver and the whole in a tank of water, fifteen or sixteen feet deep in the water, with the end of the tube therefore out of the water, then if there is any difference at all in level between the two vessels, say an inch, all the quicksilver in the higher vessel will rise in the siphon to the top and will pass through the other leg into the lower vessel in a continuous flow; and if we keep the higher vessel supplied with quicksilver, the flow will never cease; but if we make an opening in the siphon through which the water can get in, immediately the quicksilver will fall from each leg into the vessels and water will take its place.

This rising of quicksilver does not come from the horror of the vacuum, for the air has perfectly free access to the siphon; accordingly if we emptied the tank of water, the quicksilver would fall from each leg into the corresponding vessel, and the air would take its place, coming in through the open tube.

It is then obvious that the weight of the water causes the quicksilver to rise, because the water weighs upon the quicksilver in the vessels and not upon that in the siphon; and for this reason the water by its weight forces the quicksilver to rise and to flow as it does; but as soon as the siphon has been pierced and the water can enter, it no longer makes the quicksilver rise, because it weighs inside as well as outside the siphon.

But for the same reason and by the same necessity as the water thus makes the quicksilver rise in a siphon when it weighs on the vessels and has no access to the interior of the siphon, so also the weight of the air makes water rise in ordinary siphons, because it weighs on the vessels in which the legs of the siphon dip and has no access to the body of the siphon, which is entirely closed; and as soon as an opening is made in the siphon, the water no longer rises, but on the contrary falls into each vessel, and air takes its place because then the air weighs inside as well as outside the siphon.

It is obvious that this last effect is only a case of the general rule, and that if we really understand why the weight of the water makes the quicksilver rise in the example we gave, we shall see at the same time why the weight of the air makes water rise in ordinary siphons; this is the reason it must be made perfectly clear why the weight of the water produces this effect, and why it is the higher vessel which empties into the lower vessel rather than the other way around.

To this end it must be observed that, the water weighing on the quicksilver in each of the vessels and not at all on that in the legs of the siphon dipping in the vessels, the quicksilver in the vessels is urged by the weight of the water to rise in each leg of the siphon all the way up and still higher, if that were possible, because the water is sixteen feet deep and the siphon is only one foot high, and one foot of quicksilver is equal in weight to only fourteen feet of water; whence it is seen that the weight of the water pushes the quicksilver in each leg all the way up and still has some force left; whence the quicksilver in each leg being pushed up by the weight of the water, they contend at the top of the siphon, pushing each other, so that the one having the greater force must prevail.

Now that will be easy to calculate; for it is clear that since the water has greater depth above the vessel which is an inch lower, it pushes up the quicksilver in the longer leg more forcibly than that in the other leg by the force which an inch of depth gives it; whence it seems at first the result should be that the quicksilver should be pushed from the longer leg into the shorter; but we must consider that the weight of the quicksilver in each leg resists the effort made by the water to push it up, but they do not resist equally, for since the quicksilver of the long leg has an inch more of height, it resists more forcibly by the force given it by the height of one inch; therefore the quicksilver in the longer leg is more pushed up by the weight of the water by the force of an inch of water, but it is more pushed down by its own weight by the force of an inch of quicksilver; but an inch of quicksilver weighs more than an inch of water; therefore the quicksilver in the shorter leg is pushed up with more force, and consequently it must rise and continue to rise as long as there is any quicksilver in the vessel in which it dips.

Whence it is apparent that the reason why the higher vessel empties into the lower is that quicksilver is a heavier liquid than water. The opposite would happen if the siphon were filled with oil and the whole were in the same tank of water, for then the oil in the lower vessel would rise and flow through the top of the siphon into the higher vessel for the same reasons just given; for the water still pushing the oil in the lower vessel with more force because it has an inch more of depth and the oil in the long leg resisting and weighing more by its extra inch of height, since an inch of oil weighs less than an inch of water, the oil in the long leg would be pushed up with more force than the oil in the other leg, and consequently it would flow and would pass from the lower vessel to the higher vessel.

And finally if the siphon were filled with a liquid which had the same weight as the water in the tank, then neither would the water in the higher vessel pass into the other vessel nor that in the lower pass into the higher, but everything would remain at rest, for by calculating all the forces we shall see that they are all equal.

That is what had to be firmly grasped if we were to have a thorough understanding of why liquids rise in siphons; after which it is too easy to see why the weight of the air makes water rise in ordinary siphons and pass from the higher vessel into the lower for us to give more time to it, since it is only a case of the general rule we have just given.

### 6. That the weight of the mass of the air causes the swelling of the flesh when a cupping glass is applied.

To explain how the weight of the mass of the air makes the flesh swell where a cupping glass is applied, I shall cite an entirely similar effect caused by the weight of water, which will leave no doubt in the mind.

It is the effect recorded in the *Equilibrium of liquids* (*Plate I, Figure XVII*), where I showed that a man applying to his thigh the end of a glass tube twenty feet long and seating himself in this condition at the bottom of a tank of water in such a way that the upper end of the tube emerges from the water, his flesh swells at the opening of the tube as if there were suction in that place.

Now it is evident that this swelling does not come from the horror of the vacuum, for the tube is completely open and the swelling would not occur if there were only a little water in the tank; and it is altogether certain that it comes from the weight of the water only, because the water, pressing the flesh everywhere except at the entrance of the tube (for it finds no access there), drives the blood and the flesh there to make the swelling.

And what I say of the weight of the water is to be understood of the weight of any other liquid; for if our man seats himself in a tank of oil, the same thing will happen as long as that liquid is in contact with every part of his body but one. But if the tube is removed, the swelling goes down because the water now exerting its action upon that part as well as on the others, there will be no more effect there than elsewhere.

This being understood, we shall see that when we put a candle on the flesh and a cupping glass over it, as soon as the flame is extinguished, the flesh necessarily swells; for the air in the cupping glass, which was highly rarefied by the flame, having become condensed by the cold following upon the extinction of the flame, the weight of the air is in contact with the body everywhere except beneath the cupping glass (for there is no access there); and consequently the flesh must swell there, and the weight of the air must drive the adjacent blood and flesh, which it presses, into that part which it does not press, for the same reason and by the same necessity that the weight of the water did in the example I gave, when it was in contact with the body in every place but one; whence it is apparent that the behavior of the cupping glass is only a particular case of the general rule concerning the action of all fluids upon a body with all parts of which they are in contact save one.

### 7. That the weight of the mass of the air is the cause of the attraction that takes place in suction.

Only a word is now required to explain why when we apply our mouth to water and suck, the water comes in; for we know that the weight of the air presses the water everywhere except where the mouth is, for it is in contact with it everywhere except there; and thence it is that when the respiratory muscles, lifting the chest, enlarge the capacity of the interior of the body, the air inside, having more space to fill than before, has less force to prevent the water from entering the mouth than the air outside, which weighs on the water everywhere except in this one place, has force to make it enter.

That is the cause of this attraction, which differs in no respect from the attraction of syringes.

### 8. That the weight of the mass of the air is the cause of the drawing of milk by infants from their nurses' breasts.

Similarly a baby with its lips about the nipple of its nurse’s breast, when it sucks, draws in milk, because the breast is pressed on all sides by the weight of the surrounding air except in the part which is in the child’s mouth; and that is why as soon as the respiratory muscles make more room in the child’s body, as has just been said, and nothing is in contact with the nipple of the breast but the air inside, the air outside, which has more force and compresses the breast, pushes the milk through this opening where there is less resistance; which is as necessary and as natural as for the milk to come out when the nipple is pressed between the hands.

### 9. That the weight of the mass of the air is the cause of the drawing in of air in breathing.

And for the same reason when we breathe, air enters the lungs, because when the lungs open and the nose and all the passages are free and open, the air which is in contact with these passages, pushed by the weight of all its mass, enters and falls by the natural and necessary action of its weight; which is so understandable, so easy, and so simple that it is strange recourse should have been had to the horror of the vacuum, to occult qualities, and to causes so remote and so chimerical, to find a reason, since it is as natural for air to enter and to fall in this way into the lungs when they open as for wine to fall into a bottle when it is poured in.

This is the way in which the weight of the air produces all the effects hitherto attributed to the horror of the vacuum. I have explained the chief of them; if any remain, it is so easy to understand them after these that I should think I was being both superfluous and tedious if I sought out others to treat in detail; and it may even be said they had all been seen already, as in their source, in the preceding treatise, since all these effects are only particular cases of the general rule concerning the equilibrium of fluids.

## Chapter 3. That as the weight of the mass of the air is limited, so the effects it produces are limited.

Since the weight of the air produces all the effects hitherto attributed to the horror of the vacuum, it should be the case that since this weight is not infinite but has limits, its effects too should be limited; which is confirmed by experiment, as what follows will show.

As soon as we raise the piston of a suction pump or of a syringe, the water follows, and if we continue to raise it, the water will keep on following, but not to any height whatsoever, for there is a certain point it does not pass, which is approximately at the height of thirty-one feet; so that as long as we only raise the piston to this height, the water rises and remains always in contact with the piston, but as soon as we raise the piston higher, it no longer draws the water with it, but the water remains motionless and suspended at that height without rising further, and to whatever height we raise the piston beyond, the water lets it go without following it.

The cause of which is that the mass of the air weighs approximately as much as water at a depth of thirty-one feet; so that as it makes the water rise in the syringe because it weighs outside and not inside, in order to counterbalance the water it makes it rise to the height at which it has the same weight as itself, and then the water in the syringe and the air outside weighing equally, the whole is in equilibrium, just as water and quicksilver are in equilibrium when their heights are to each other [reciprocally] as their weights, as we have so often shown in the *Equilibrium of liquids*; and as the water rose only for the reason that the weight of the air forced it to, when it has arrived at that height at which the weight of the air can no longer make it rise, no other cause moving it, it remains at that point.

And whatever the size of the pump, the water always rises to the same height, because liquids do not weigh according to their bulk but according to their height, as we have shown in the *Equilibrium of liquids*.

But if we draw up quicksilver in a syringe, it will rise to a height of two feet, three inches, and five lines, which is precisely the height at which it weighs as much as thirty-one feet of water, because it will weigh as much then as the mass of the air.

And if we draw up oil in a pump, it will rise to about thirty-four feet and no more; because it weighs as much at this height as water at thirty-one feet, and consequently as much as the air; and similarly with all other liquids.

A tube stopped at the top and open at the bottom, having been filled with water, if it has any length we please less than thirty-one feet, all the water will remain suspended in it; because the weight of the mass of the air is capable of holding it there.

But if it is longer than thirty-one feet, the water will fall part way, that is, until it has a height of only thirty-one feet; and then it will remain suspended at this height without falling lower, just as in the *Equilibrium of liquids* we saw that the quicksilver in a tube placed in a tank of water fell part way until it came to rest at the height at which it weighed as much as the water.

But if we were to put in the tube quicksilver instead of water, the quicksilver would fall until it came to rest at the height of two feet, three inches, and five lines, which exactly corresponds to thirty-one feet of water.

And if we slant a little these tubes in which water and quicksilver remain suspended, these liquids will rise until they have returned to their former height, which was diminished by the slanting, because the weight of the air prevails as long as they are below that height and is in equilibrium when they have reached it; which is exactly like what is recorded in the *Treatise on the equilibrium of liquids* of a tube of quicksilver immersed in a tank of water; and if the tube is straightened, the liquids fall again, always to return to the same height.

Thus in a siphon all the water in the higher vessel rises and passes into the lower vessel as long as the leg of the siphon dipping in it is of any length we please less than thirty-one feet; because, as I have said elsewhere, the weight of the air is quite capable of lifting water to this height and holding it suspended there; but as soon as the leg dipping in the higher vessel exceeds this length, the siphon no longer works (that is, the water in the higher vessel no longer rises to the top of the siphon to pass into the other vessel, because the weight of the air cannot lift it higher than thirty-one feet); so that the water divides at the top of the siphon and falls in each leg into the corresponding vessel until it comes to rest at the height of thirty-one feet above each vessel, and remains suspended at this height by the weight of the air which counterbalances it.

If we slant the siphon a little, the water will rise in both legs until it has again reached the height which the slanting had diminished; and if we slant it until the top of the siphon has an elevation of only thirty-one feet above the surface of the higher vessel, the water in the leg dipping in that vessel will be at the top of the siphon, so that it will fall into the other leg; and thus the water in the higher vessel always taking its place, there will be a continuous flow, but in a thin trickle only; and if we slant the siphon more, the water will flow at the full capacity of the tube.

The same thing must be understood of all other liquids, allowance being made for the ratio of their weights.

Thus if we try to open a bellows, as long as we do not use more than a certain amount of force, we shall be unable to do it; but if we pass that point, we shall open it. Now the required force is as follows: if the wings of the bellows are a foot in diameter, there will be needed to open it a force able to lift a vessel filled with water one foot in diameter, like the wings, and thirty-one feet high, which is the height to which water rises in a pump. If the wings are only six inches in diameter, there will be needed to open the bellows a force equal to the weight of the water in a vessel six inches in diameter and thirty-one feet high, and similarly of the rest; so that by hanging to one of the wings a weight equal to that of the water just specified we shall open the bellows, and a lesser weight could not do it, because the weight of the air pressing it is exactly equal to that of thirty-one feet of water.

The same weight will raise the piston of a sealed syringe, and the same weight will separate two polished bodies placed together; so that if they are an inch in diameter, by applying to them a force equal to the weight of thirty-one feet of water one inch in diameter we shall separate them.

## Chapter 4. That as the weight of the mass of the air increases when it is more laden with moisture and diminishes when it is less laden, so the effects it produces increase and diminish proportionally.

Since the weight of the air causes all the effects we are considering and since that weight is not always the same for the same place but constantly varies according to the humidity, its effects should not always be uniform but, on the contrary, constantly variable; this is confirmed by experiment, which shows that the measure of thirty-one feet of water, which we gave to serve as an example, is not a precise measure always accurate; for water does not rise in pumps exactly to this height and always remain suspended there; on the contrary sometimes it rises to thirty-one and a half feet, then returns to thirty-one feet, then falls again three inches more, then suddenly rises a foot, following the variations of the air, and all that with the same freakishness with which the air passes from murky to clear.

And experiment shows that the same pump lifts water higher at one time than at another by one foot, eight inches. So that a pump, and for the same reason a siphon, can be made of such a height that at one time they will work and at another time they will not, according as the air is more or less laden with moisture or for some other reason weighs more or less; which would make a rather interesting experiment and not too hard if we used quicksilver instead of water, for in that way such long tubes would not be needed.

Hence we are to understand that water remains suspended in tubes at a lesser height at one time than at another and that a bellows is easier to open at one time than at another precisely in the same ratio, and similarly with the other effects; for what is said of one applies exactly to all the rest, each in accordance with its own nature.

## Chapter 5. That since the weight of the mass of the air is greater over low places than over high places, so the effects produced by it there are proportionately greater.

Since the weight of the mass of the air produces all the effects we are considering and since that mass is not the same over every place on the earth because it is greater over the lower places, the effects should be different there too; as indeed experiment confirms, showing that the measure of thirty-one feet I had taken as an example is not the height to which water rises in pumps everywhere in the world; for it rises to different heights in all places not at the same level (the lower the altitude the higher the water rises and the higher the altitude the lower the water rises); so that by experiments made in places differing in altitude by five or six hundred fathoms a difference of four feet, three inches has been found, so that the same pump which lifts water in one place to a height of thirty feet, four inches lifts it, under the same atmospheric conditions, in another place some five hundred fathoms higher only to a height of twenty-six feet, one inch, which constitutes a difference of one-sixth.

The same thing should be understood of all the other effects, each in its own fashion; that is to say, for example, that two polished bodies are more difficult to separate in a valley than on a mountain top, and so on.

But as five hundred fathoms of altitude cause four feet, three inches difference in the height of the water, lesser altitudes make proportionately lesser differences; one hundred fathoms about ten inches, twenty fathoms about two inches, and so on.

The best instrument for observing such variations is a glass tube, stopped at the top, recurved at the bottom, three or four feet long, to which a strip of paper has been pasted, divided into inches and lines; for if we fill it with quicksilver, we shall see that part of the quicksilver will fall and part of it will remain suspended, and we shall be able to notice exactly the point at which it will be suspended; and it will be easy to observe the variations which will take place there because of the varying humidity following upon changes in the weather, and those which will take place through the tube’s being carried to a higher altitude; for leaving it in the same place, we shall see that as the weather changes the quicksilver will rise and fall, and we shall see that it will vary from one time to another by one inch, six lines, which correspond exactly to one foot, eight inches of water, which I gave in another chapter for the difference caused by changes in weather.

And carrying the tube from the foot of a mountain to the summit, we shall see that when we have gone up ten fathoms the quicksilver will have fallen close to a line, when we have gone up twenty fathoms it will have fallen two lines, when we have gone up a hundred fathoms it will have fallen nine lines. And as we go down, the quicksilver will rise again by the same amounts.

All this was tested on the Puy de Dôme in Auvergne, as can be seen in the account of that experiment; and these measurements of quicksilver correspond exactly to those we have just given of water.

The same thing is to be understood with respect to the difficulty in opening a bellows, and of the rest.

Wherein we see that exactly the same thing happens in the effects produced by the weight of the air as in those produced by the weight of water; for we saw that a bellows immersed in water and hard to open because of the weight of the water, is the less so, the nearer we bring it to the surface; and that the quicksilver in a tube immersed in water remains suspended at a greater or lesser height according as it is more or less deep in the water; and all these effects, whether of the weight of the air or of that of water, are such necessary consequences of the equilibrium of fluids that there is nothing clearer in the world.

## Chapter 6. That as the effects of the weight of the mass of the air increase or diminish according as that weight increases or diminishes, they would cease entirely if we were above the air or in a place where there were none.

Having now seen that the effects hitherto attributed to the horror of the vacuum but actually due to the weight of the air always depend upon its quantity and that as it increases, they increase and as it diminishes, they diminish; and that for this reason we see in the tube filled with quicksilver the quicksilver remains suspended at a height so much the lower as the tube is carried to a higher altitude, because less air is left above it, just as the quicksilver in a tube immersed in water falls as the tube is lifted toward the surface of the water, because less water is left to counterbalance it; we may conclude with assurance that if we carried the tube to the top of the extreme limit of the air and lifted it entirely out of the air's sphere, the quicksilver would fall entirely since there would no longer be any air to counterbalance it, just as the quicksilver in the tube immersed in water falls entirely when we draw the tube entirely out of the water.

The same thing would happen if we could remove all the air from the room in which the experiment was made; for if there were no longer any air weighing upon the recurved end of the tube, we must believe that the quicksilver would fall, no longer having a counterpoise.

But because both of these experiments are impossible, since we cannot go above the air and since we could not live in a room entirely emptied of air, it is sufficient to remove the air, not from the entire room, but only from about the tube’s recurved end to keep the air away from it, in order to see if all the quicksilver will fall when there is no longer any air to counterbalance it; and this can easily be done as follows:

We must have a tube recurved at the bottom, closed at the end A and open at the end B, and another tube, straight throughout, open at both ends, M and N, but with the end M inserted and soldered into the recurved end of the other tube, as in the figure.

> We must stop B, which is the opening of the recurved end of the first tube, with the finger or otherwise, as with a pig’s bladder, and invert the whole tube (that is to say, the two tubes, which actually make only one, since they open into each other), fill it with quicksilver and then put the end A at the top again and the end N in a basin of quicksilver; what will happen is that the quicksilver of the upper tube will fall in its entirety and all of it will be caught in the curved end, unless a part of it flows into the lower tube by the opening at M; but only part of the quicksilver in the lower tube will fall and part of it will remain suspended at a height of from twenty-six to twenty-seven inches, according to the place and time of the experiment. Now the reason for this difference is that the air weighs upon the quicksilver in the basin at the bottom of the lower tube, and accordingly it holds the quicksilver inside suspended and in equilibrium; but it does not weigh on the quicksilver at the recurved end of the upper tube (for the finger or the pig’s bladder closing it keeps the air out); so that as there is no air weighing on this part, the quicksilver in the tube is free to fall since nothing holds it up and opposes its falling.

But since nothing is lost in nature, if the quicksilver in the curved end does not feel the weight of the air because the finger stopping the opening keeps it away, the finger itself, by compensation, suffers much pain, for it endures all the weight of the air pressing down from above and nothing holds it up from below; therefore it feels itself pressed against the glass and, as it were, drawn and sucked inside the tube, and a swelling forms, as if under a cupping glass, because the weight of the air pressing our finger, our hand, and our whole body everywhere except at the end of the finger (where it has no access), that part swells and feels pain for the reason just given.

And if we remove our finger from the opening, the quicksilver in the recurved end will suddenly rise in the tube to a height of from twenty-six to twenty-seven inches, because the air suddenly falling on the quicksilver will immediately lift it to the height capable of counterbalancing it, and even, because of the violence of its fall, it lifts the quicksilver a little beyond the limit; but the quicksilver will afterwards fall a little lower and then it will rise again, and after some goings and comings, as of a weight suspended at the end of a string, it will come to rest at a certain height, at which it exactly counterbalances the air.

Whence we see that when the air does not weigh on the quicksilver at the recurved end, all the quicksilver in the tube falls, and that consequently if we had taken the tube to a place where there was no air or, if possible, beyond the air's sphere, all the quicksilver would fall.

### Conclusion of the last three chapters.

Whence it may be concluded that as the weight of the air is great, small, or null, so the height to which water rises in the pump is great, small, or null, and that the height is always exactly in proportion to the weight, as effect to cause.

The same thing must be understood with respect to the difficulty of opening a sealed bellows, and so on.

## Chapter 7. How far water rises in pumps everywhere on the earth.

From everything we know it follows that there are as many different measures of the height to which water rises in pumps as there are different conditions of place and weather for taking the measurement; and that thus if we are asked to what height suction pumps lift water in general, we could not give an exact answer to the question, or even to this other: to what height pumps lift water at Paris, unless the state of the air is also specified, since they lift water higher when the air is more laden with moisture; but it is quite possible to say to what height pumps lift water at Paris when the air is most laden, for everything is specified. But without stopping at the different heights to which water is lifted in each place according as the air is more or less laden, I shall take the height of the water when the air carries its mean burden of moisture as the natural height of that place, because it is midway between the two extremes and by knowing that measurement we shall know the other two, because we have only to add or subtract ten inches. Accordingly I shall give the height to which water rises everywhere in the world, whatever the altitude, when the air has its average moisture.

But first it must be understood that in all pumps at the same altitude water rises to exactly the same height (I always mean in the same state of the atmosphere), for since the air has the same height there and consequently the same weight, the weight produces like effects.

And that is why I shall first give the height to which water is raised in places at sea level, because the sea is all exactly at the same level (that is to say, equally distant at all points from the center of the earth), for liquids cannot otherwise come to rest since the higher parts would flow down; and so the height to which we find water rises in pumps at any place whatever on the coast will be common to all places in the world on the coast, and it will be easy to infer from that the height to which water will rise in places higher or lower by ten, twenty, one hundred, two hundred, or five hundred fathoms, since we have given the differences caused by such differences in altitude.

At sea level suction pumps lift water to the height of approximately thirty-one feet, two inches (that is, when the air has its average moisture).

This is the measure common to all places in the world at sea level; whence it follows that a siphon lifts water in those places as long as its shorter leg is less than thirty-one feet, two inches, and that a sealed bellows is opened by the weight of water having that height and the width of its wings; which is in conformity with the general rule. It is easy to know from this to what height water is raised by pumps in places ten fathoms higher; for since I have said that ten fathoms of altitude cause a decrease of one inch in the height to which water rises, it follows that at those places the water rises only to thirty-one feet, one inch.

And in the same way we find that in places twenty fathoms above sea level water rises to only thirty-one feet.

In those one hundred fathoms above sea level water rises to only thirty feet, four inches.

In those with an altitude of two hundred fathoms water rises to twenty-nine feet, six inches.

In those with an altitude of about five hundred fathoms water rises to almost twenty-seven feet.

Similarly we could make observations for the rest. And for places lower than sea level we shall find in the same way the heights to which the water rises by adding, instead of subtracting, the differences caused by these differences in altitude.

### Consequences

1.  From all this it is easy to see that a pump never lifts water at Paris to thirty-two feet and never lifts it to less than twenty-nine and a half feet.
2.  We also see that a siphon whose short leg is thirty-two feet long never works at Paris.
3.  That a siphon whose short leg is twenty-nine feet long or less always works at Paris.
4.  That at Paris a siphon whose short leg is exactly thirty-one feet long sometimes works and sometimes does not work, depending on the humidity of the air.
5.  That a siphon with a short leg twenty-nine feet long always works at Paris and never works in a higher place, such as Clermont in Auvergne.
6.  That a siphon ten feet high works everywhere in the world, for there is no mountain high enough to keep it from working; and that a siphon fifty feet long works nowhere in the world, for there is no cave deep enough to make a sufficient depth of air to raise water thus high.
7.  That water rises in the pumps at Dieppe, when the air has its average moisture, to thirty-one feet, two inches, as I have said, and when the air is most laden to thirty-two feet; that it rises in pumps on mountains five hundred fathoms above the sea, when the air has its mean burden of moisture, to twenty-six feet, eleven inches, and when it is least laden to twenty-six feet, one inch; so that there is a difference between this height and that occurring at Dieppe when the air is most laden of five feet, eleven inches, which is almost one-fourth of the height occurring on mountains.
8.  Just as we see that in all places at the same level water rises to the same height and that it rises less in those of greater elevation, so, conversely, if we see that water rises to the same height in two different places, we can conclude they have the same altitude, and if it does not rise to the same height, we can judge by the difference how much higher one place is than the other; which is a way of finding the altitudes of places, however far apart, quite exactly and very easily; since instead of using a suction pump, which would be hard to make thus long, we need only take a tube three or four feet in length, filled with quicksilver and stopped at the top, such as we have often spoken of, and see at what height the quicksilver remains suspended, for its height corresponds perfectly to the height to which water rises in pumps.
9.  We also see from this that the degrees of heat are not accurately marked in the best thermometers; since all the different heights at which the water remains suspended have always been attributed to the rarefaction or condensation of the air inside the tube, but we learn from these experiments that changes in the outside air, that is, in the mass of the air, have a great deal to do with them.

I pass over a large number of other consequences which follow from this new knowledge, as for example the means it gives us of finding out the exact extent of the air’s sphere and of the vapors called the atmosphere; since by taking exact observations for every hundred fathoms and noting the differences caused by the first hundred, by the second hundred, and by all the remaining hundreds we would be able to determine accurately the entire height of the air. But I leave all that to devote myself to what is essential to the subject.

## Chapter 8. How much each place in the world is pressed by the weight of the mass of the air.

We learn from these experiments that since the weight of the air and the weight of the water in pumps are in equilibrium, they weigh exactly the same, and that by thus knowing the height to which water rises everywhere in the world we know at the same time how much each place is pressed by the weight of the air above it, and consequently:

That places beside the sea are pressed by the weight of the air above them, up to the top of its sphere, exactly as much as if instead of this air there were substituted a column of water thirty-one feet, two inches in height.

Places with an altitude of ten fathoms as much as if they carried thirty-one feet, one inch of water.

Places with an altitude of five hundred fathoms as much as if they carried twenty-six feet, eleven inches of water, and similarly of the rest.

## Chapter 9. How much the entire mass of all the air in the world weighs.

We learn from these experiments that the air at sea level has the same weight as water at a height of thirty-one feet, two inches; but because the air weighs less on places above sea level and therefore does not weigh the same on all places on the earth, and even weighs everywhere differently, we cannot calculate a fixed measure which will show how much all places in the world, reduced to an average altitude, are pressed by the air; but we can arrive at a measure by conjecture approaching very closely to the true measure, as for example we may assume that all places on the earth in general, reduced to an average altitude and considered as equally pressed by the air, are as much pressed as if they carried thirty-one feet of water; and it is certain that the error in this assumption is not half a foot of water.

Now we have seen that the air over mountains five hundred fathoms high weighs as much as water at the height of twenty-six feet, eleven inches.

And consequently all the air from sea level to the mountain tops five hundred fathoms high weighs as much as water at the height of four feet, one inch, and since that is about one-seventh of the entire height, it is obvious that the air lying between the sea and these mountains is about one-seventh of the entire mass of the air.

We learn from these same experiments that the heavy vapors in the air, when it is most charged with them, weigh as much as water at a height of one foot, eight inches, since to counterbalance themselves, they raise the water in the pumps to this height above the height at which the water already counterbalanced the weight of the air; so that if all the vapors above a region were reduced to water, as happens when they are converted to rain, they could produce only one foot, eight inches of water over that region. And if storms sometimes occur in which the rainfall comes to a greater height, it is because the wind carries vapor there from neighboring regions.

We also see from this that if the whole sphere of the air were pressed and compressed against the earth by a force which, pushing it from above, reduced it to the smallest possible compass below and reduced it to water, it would then have a height of only thirty-one feet.

And consequently that we must consider the whole mass of the air, in its present free state, as if it had formerly been like a mass of water thirty-one feet deep about the entire earth, which should have been extremely rarefied and dilated and converted into this state we call air, in which it occupies more space, to be sure, but keeps exactly the same weight as thirty-one feet of water.

And as there would be nothing easier than to calculate how many pounds all the water surrounding the earth to a height of thirty-one feet would weigh and as a child who knows addition and subtraction could do it, we should find by the same calculation how many pounds all the air there is weighs, since it is the same thing; and if we work it out, we shall find the weight of the mass of the air is approximately eight millions of millions of millions of pounds.

I wanted to give myself this pleasure, and this is how I did the reckoning.

I supposed that the diameter of a circle is to its circumference as 7 is to 22.

I supposed that when the diameter of a sphere is multiplied by the circumference of its great circle, the product is the area of the spherical surface.

We know that the circumference of the earth has been divided into 360 degrees. This division was arbitrary, for it could have been divided into more or less than 360, if desired, as could also the celestial circles.

It has been found that each of the degrees contains 50,000 fathoms.

Leagues in the neighborhood of Paris are 2,500 fathoms, and consequently there are 20 leagues to a degree; some count 25, but they also give only 2,000 fathoms to the league, which comes to the same thing.

Each fathom has 6 feet.

A cubic foot of water weighs 72 pounds.

Whereupon it is very easy to make the desired calculation.

For since the great circle, or circumference, of the earth is 360 degrees,

The distance around it is, therefore, 7,200 leagues.

And by the ratio of the circumference to the diameter its diameter will be 2,291 leagues.

Therefore multiplying the diameter of the earth by the circumference of its great circle, we shall find that its spherical surface has 16,495,200 square leagues.

That is to say 103,095,000,000,000 square fathoms.

That is to say 3,711,420,000,000,000 square feet.

And since a cubic foot of water weighs 72 pounds

It follows that a prism of water with a base of 1 square foot and 31 feet high weighs 2,232 pounds.

Therefore if the earth were covered with water to a height of thirty-one feet, there would be as many prisms of water thirty-one feet high as there are square feet in its surface (I know full well they would not be prisms but sectors of a sphere, and I purposely neglect to be precise).

And consequently the earth would carry as many units of water, each weighing 2,232 pounds, as it has square feet in its surface.

Therefore all this mass of water would weigh 8,283,889,440,000,000,000 pounds.

Therefore the mass of all the air there is has this same weight of 8,283,889,440,000,000,000 pounds.

That is to say, eight million million million, two hundred eighty-three thousand eight hundred eighty-nine million million, four hundred forty thousand million pounds.

### Conclusion of the two preceding treatises

I have recorded in general in the preceding treatises all the effects which it has hitherto been believed nature produces to avoid a vacuum; wherein I have shown it is absolutely false that they occur for this imaginary reason. And I have demonstrated on the contrary by arguments and experiments absolutely convincing that the weight of the mass of the air is their true and only cause. So that it is now certain there is no effect in the whole of nature produced by her to avoid a vacuum.

After that it will not be difficult to show that nature does not abhor a vacuum, for this way of speaking is improper, since created nature, which is here in question, being inanimate is not capable of passion; accordingly such speech is metaphorical, and nothing more is meant by it than that nature makes the same efforts to avoid the vacuum that she would make if she abhorred it; so that in the

opinion of those who speak in this fashion, it is the same thing to say that nature
abhors a vacuum and to say that nature makes great efforts to prevent a vacuum.
Therefore, since I have shown that she does nothing to avoid the vacuum, it follows
that she does not abhor it, for to go on with the same figure, as we say of a man
that he is indifferent to a thing if we never observe in any of his actions a movement
of desire or aversion for this thing, so we must say of nature that she is
perfectly indifferent to the vacuum since we never see her doing anything either
to seek it or to avoid it (I always mean by the word vacuum a space empty of all
bodies perceptible to sense).

It is perfectly true (and this is what led the ancients astray) that water rises in
a pump when there is no opening for the air to get in and there would therefore
be a vacuum if the water did not follow the plunger, and also that water no
longer rises as soon as there are cracks through which the air can enter to fill the
pump; whence it seems the water rises only to prevent a vacuum since it rises
only when there would be a vacuum.

It is certain likewise that a bellows is hard to open when its apertures are so
carefully stopped that the air cannot get in and that therefore if it were opened,
there would be a vacuum, whereas this resistance ceases when the air can enter to
fill the bellows, so that resistance is met only when there would be a vacuum;
whence it seems that resistance occurs only from fear of a vacuum.

Finally it is certain that all bodies in general make great efforts to follow each
other and to keep united whenever there would be a vacuum between them if
they were separated, and never otherwise; and that is why the conclusion has
been drawn that their adhesion comes from the fear of the vacuum.

But to show the weakness of this inference I shall make use of the following
example: when a bellows is in the water in the way I have often described so that
the tip of the tube, which I suppose to be twenty feet long, is out of the water
and exposed to the air and the apertures which are in one of the wings are carefully
stopped to keep the water out, we know that the bellows is opened with
difficulty, and with the greater difficulty the more water there is above it, and
that if we remove the stoppers from the airholes and the water is free to come in,
the resistance ceases.

If we wanted to argue in the same way about this effect as about the others,
we should say: when the apertures are stopped and therefore, if the bellows were
opened, air would come in by the tube, it is opened with difficulty, and when the
water can get in to fill the bellows instead of air, the resistance ceases. Therefore,
since the bellows resists when air would enter and not otherwise, the resistance
comes from its horror of the air.

Everybody would laugh at this inference because there can be another cause
for the bellows’ resistance. And indeed it is obvious that we could not open it
without raising the water since the water we would displace in opening it could
not enter the body of the bellows, and therefore it would have to find room for
itself elsewhere and would have to raise the whole mass, and that is what causes
the resistance; which does not occur when the bellows has apertures through
which the water may enter, for then, whether we open or close the bellows, the
water neither rises nor falls, because the water displaced enters the bellows as fast
as it is displaced; accordingly the bellows is opened without resistance.

That is perfectly clear, and consequently we must consider that the bellows
cannot be opened without two things happening: one, that air certainly does
enter, the other, that the mass of the water is lifted; and it is the latter which
causes the resistance and the former is quite unrelated to it, although it takes
place at the same time.

Let us speak in the same way about the difficulty experienced in opening in the
air a bellows with all its apertures stopped; if it were forcibly opened, two things
would happen: one, that there certainly would be a vacuum, the other, that it
would be necessary to lift and hold up the whole mass of the air; and it is the
latter which causes the resistance encountered and the former has nothing to do
with it; accordingly the resistance increases and diminishes in proportion to the
weight of the air, as I have shown.

The same thing must be understood of the resistance encountered in separating
all bodies between which there would be a vacuum; for the air cannot get in,
otherwise there would not be a vacuum. And so we could not separate them without
lifting and holding up the entire mass of the air, and that is what causes
the resistance.

There you have the true cause of the adhesion of bodies between which there
would be a vacuum, which we have remained so long without knowing because
we have remained so long in false opinions, from which we have only gradually
emerged; so that there have been three different periods in which different views
have been held.

There were three errors in the world which absolutely prevented our knowing
the true cause of the adhesion of bodies.

The first error is that almost from the beginning the air was believed to have
levity, because the ancient authors said so and because those whose profession
it is to believe them followed them blindly and would have remained eternally of
that opinion if abler persons had not freed them from it by the force of experiment;
so that it was not possible to think that the weight of the air was the cause
of the adhesion of bodies when the air was thought not to have any weight.

## THE WEIGHT OF THE AIR

The second error is that it was imagined that the elements do not weigh when
in themselves, for no other reason than that we do not feel the weight of water
when we are in it and that a bucket of water is easy to lift as long as it is still there
and only begins to make its weight felt when it leaves the water; as if these effects
could come from no other cause or rather as if this cause were not out of the
question, there being no reason to believe that the water we draw in a bucket has
weight when it is taken out of the water and no longer has any when it is poured
back in, that it loses its weight when confounded with the rest and regains it
when it quits the level of the water. Strange ways that men seek to conceal their
ignorance! Because they could not understand why we do not feel the weight of
the water and were unwilling to admit it, they said it has no weight in water, to
satisfy their vanity by the overthrow of truth, and in this way it became an accepted
opinion; and that is why as long as men clung to this fancy it was impossible
to believe that the weight of the air was the cause of these effects; since
even if they had known that the air is heavy, they would still have said that it does
not weigh when in itself, and therefore they would not have believed that it
produced any effect by its weight.

This is why I showed in the *Equilibrium of liquids* that water weighs when in
itself as much as when outside, and I explained there why in spite of that weight
a bucket is easy to lift in water and why we do not feel its weight; and in the
*Treatise on the weight of the mass of the air* I showed the same thing with respect to
the air in order to clear up all doubts.

The third error is of a different sort; it is not with respect to the air, but has to
do with the effects they attributed to the horror of the vacuum, about which they
had completely false ideas.

For they imagined that a pump lifts water not only to ten or twenty feet, which
is perfectly true, but even to fifty, a hundred, a thousand, and to any height
desired, without limit.

They also believed that it is not only hard to separate two polished bodies
placed together, but absolutely impossible, that an angel could not do it, nor
any created force, with a hundred exaggerations too idle to mention; and similarly
of the rest.

This is an error of fact so ancient that we do not know its origin; even Heron,
one of the first and most excellent authors to write on the raising of water, expressly
states, as a thing that may not be doubted, that the water of a river can be
carried over a mountain to be poured into the valley on the other side, provided
it be a little lower, by means of a siphon placed on the summit with its legs extending
down the sides, one in the river, the other in the next valley; and he
asserts that the water will rise from the river to the mountain to redescend into the
other valley, whatever the height of the mountain.

All those who have written of these matters have said the same thing; and even
all our fountain builders still claim today that they can make suction pumps
which will raise water sixty feet, if desired.

Not that either Heron or these authors or these artisans, and still less the philosophers,
carried their experiments very far, for if they had tried to raise water
only forty feet, they would have found it impossible; but they had seen suction
pumps and siphons six feet, ten feet, twelve feet long, which did not fail to work,
and they had never seen the water fail to rise in all the experiments they had
happened to make. So that they did not imagine there was a certain point beyond
which it would be otherwise. They thought they were dealing with a necessity of
nature, whose order could not be changed; and since they believed the water rose
because of an invincible horror of the vacuum, they were sure it would continue
to rise, as it had begun, without ever ceasing; and in this way inferring from
what they did see to what they did not see, they gave out both as equally true.

And it was believed with such certainty that the philosophers have made of it
one of the chief principles of their science and the foundation of their treatises
on the vacuum. It is laid down every day in the classroom and everywhere in the
world, and as far back as our written records go all men have held to this opinion,
without anyone's ever having opposed it until now.

Perhaps this example will open the eyes of those who dare not think an opinion
doubtful if it has from all time been universally accepted by all men, since simple
artisans have been capable of convicting of error all the great men called philosophers.
For Galileo declares in his *Dialogues* [^1] that he learned from the Italian
fountain makers that pumps lift water only to a certain height, after which he
tested it himself; and others afterwards made the experiment in Italy, and since
then in France with quicksilver, more conveniently, but only showing the same
thing in several different ways.

Before this was known, it could not be demonstrated that the weight of the
air was what raised water in pumps, for that weight, since it is limited, could not
produce an infinite effect.

But all these experiments did not suffice to show that the air produces these
effects, because although they freed us from one error, they left us in another.
For certainly it was learned from all these experiments that water rises only to a
certain height, but it was not learned that water rose higher in places of lower
altitude. It was thought on the contrary that it always rose to the same height,
that it was everywhere invariable; and since the weight of the air never occurred
to anyone, it was imagined that the nature of the pump is such that it lifts water
to a certain limited height and no further. Accordingly Galileo considered it as
the pump's natural height, and called it *la altessa limitatissima* [the fixed elevation].

How then could it have been imagined that this height was variable according
to the variety of places? Certainly that was not likely; and yet this last error made
it still impossible to prove that the weight of the air is the cause of these effects,
for since that weight is greater at the foot of a mountain than at the top, it is
manifest that the effects will be proportionately greater there.

That is why I came to the conclusion that we could arrive at the proof only
by making the experiment in two places differing from each other in altitude by
four or five hundred fathoms. And I selected for this purpose the Puy de Dome
in Auvergne for the reason I gave in a little pamphlet I had printed as early as
the year 1648, as soon as the experiment had been successfully made.

This experiment, having revealed that water rises in pumps to quite different
heights according to the variety of place and weather and that its height is always
proportional to the weight of the air, perfected our knowledge of these effects;
it put all doubts to rest; it showed their true cause; it established that it is not the
horror of the vacuum; and in short it supplied all the illumination anyone could
wish on this subject.

Let it be explained now, if possible, otherwise than by the weight of the air
why suction pumps lift water less high by one-quarter on the Puy de Dome in
Auvergne than at Dieppe.

Why the same siphon lifts water and transfers it at Dieppe and not at Paris.

Why two polished bodies placed together are more easily pulled apart on a
belfry than in the street.

Why a bellows with all its apertures stopped is easier to open on top of a house
than in the yard.

Why, when the air is more laden with moisture, the piston of a sealed syringe
is harder to draw up.

Finally why all these effects are always proportional to the weight of the air,
as effect to cause.

Does nature abhor a vacuum more on mountains than in valleys, more in wet
weather than in clear weather? Does she not hate it equally on a belfry, in an attic,
and in the yard?

Let all the disciples of Aristotle bring together all the strongest arguments
there are in the writings of their master and of his commentators to account for
these things by the horror of the vacuum, if they can; if not, let them recognize
that experiments are the true masters to follow in physics, that the experiment
made on the mountains overturned the universal belief everywhere held that nature
abhors a vacuum and opened up this knowledge which can nevermore be
forgotten, that nature has no horror of the vacuum, that she does nothing to
avoid it, and that the weight of the mass of the air is the true cause of all the
effects hitherto attributed to that imaginary cause.

## ON GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION
(On the Geometrical Mind)

1. We may have three main objects in the study of truth: first, to find it when
we are seeking it; second, to demonstrate it after we have found it; third, to
distinguish it from error by examining it.

I shall not speak of the first; I shall deal especially with the second, which
includes the third. For if we know how to prove the truth, we shall know at the
same time how to distinguish it from error, since by examining whether the proof
we give conforms to the rules we know we shall find out whether the truth has
been exactly demonstrated.

Geometry, which excels in all three of these ways, has expounded the art of
finding unknown truths. This art, which is called analysis, would be useless to
discuss after all the excellent books that have been written about it.

The art of demonstrating truths already found and of making them so clear
that their proofs cannot be refuted is the only art I wish to give. To that end I
have only to expound the method used by geometry, which geometry itself
teaches perfectly by example without ever putting it into words. And because
this art consists of two main parts, the proving of each proposition individually
and the arranging of all the propositions in the best order, my treatise will have
two sections, of which one will contain the rules of geometrical demonstrations,
that is, scientific and perfect demonstrations, and the other will contain the rules
of geometrical order, that is, scientific and complete order; so that the two sections
taken together will include everything necessary for guiding the reason in
proving truths and in distinguishing them from errors. My intention is to give
these rules in their entirety.

### Section 1. Concerning the method of geometrical demonstrations, that is, scientific and perfect demonstrations

I can give no clearer idea of the procedure we should follow to make our
demonstrations convincing than by expounding the method observed in
geometry.

But first I must give the idea of a method still more eminent and complete,
but a method to which man could never attain. For what goes beyond geometry
goes beyond man. Nevertheless I must say something about it although it is
impossible to put it into practice.

This true method, which would produce demonstrations of supreme excellence
if it were possible to attain to it, would consist of two main rules: to use no term
of which we had not already clearly explained the meaning, and never to put
forward any proposition unless demonstrated by truths already known; that is,
in a word, to define all the terms and to prove all the propositions. But to follow
the very order I am expounding I must state what I understand by definition.

Geometry recognizes only those definitions which logicians call nominal, impositions
of a name, that is, on things clearly designated by terms perfectly well
known. I speak of such definitions only.

Their usefulness and function is to clarify discourse and to make it more concise
by expressing by the name we impose what would otherwise require several
terms, in such a way, however, that the name imposed remains deprived of every
other meaning, if it has any, keeping only that one to which it has been uniquely
assigned. For example, if we need to distinguish among the numbers those which
can be divided into two equal parts from those which cannot, in order to avoid
the frequent repetition of this condition we give it a name as follows: I call every
number that can be divided into two equal parts an even number.

This is a geometrical definition, because after a thing, in this case every number
that can be divided into two equal parts, has been clearly pointed out, it is given
a name emptied of all other meaning, if it has any, that it may take the meaning
of the thing pointed out.

Whence it is evident that there is great freedom of definition and that definitions
are never subject to contradiction, for nothing is more permissible than to
give whatever name we please to a thing we have clearly pointed out. Only we
must be careful not to take advantage of our freedom to impose names by giving
the same name to two different things.

Not that it is inadmissible to do so if we avoid confusion by not extending the
consequences of one to the other.

But if we fall into this vice, we can apply to it a most sure and infallible remedy,
which is to substitute in the mind the definition in place of the thing defined and
always to have such an awareness of the definition that every time we speak, for
example, of an even number, we mean precisely a number that can be divided
into two equal parts, and that we understand these two things as being so inseparably
joined in thought that as soon as one of them occurs in discourse the
mind at once attaches the other to it. For geometers and all those who proceed
scientifically impose names on things only for concision of discourse and not to
impoverish or alter the idea of the subjects of discourse. And they expect the
mind always to supplement with the whole definition the short terms, which they
use only to avoid the confusion caused by a multitude of words.

Nothing acts more quickly and more effectively against the surprise attacks
of captious sophists than this method, which we must always have ready for use,
and which alone suffices to banish every kind of difficulty and equivocation.

With these things well understood, I return to my account of the true order,
which consists, as I was saying, in defining everything and in proving everything.

Certainly this method would be beautiful, but it is absolutely impossible. For
it is evident that the first terms we wished to define would presuppose others for
their explication, and that similarly the first propositions we wished to prove
would suppose others that preceded them. And thus it is clear we should never
arrive at the first propositions.

Accordingly, as we proceed ever further with our investigations, we come of
necessity to primitive words which can no longer be defined and to principles so
clear that it is no longer possible to find others more clear for their demonstration.
Whence it is apparent that men are naturally and inevitably powerless to deal with
any science whatsoever in an absolutely perfect order.

But it does not follow that we should abandon every kind of order. For there
is one, the order of geometry, which is indeed inferior in that it is less convincing
but not in that it is less certain. It does not define everything and does not prove
everything, and in this it yields to the perfect order. But it assumes only things
clear and invariant by the natural light, and that is why it is perfectly true, nature
supporting it in default of discourse. This order, the most perfect possessed by
man, does not consist either in defining everything and proving everything or in
defining nothing and proving nothing; but it consists in holding to the mean of
not defining things clear and understood by all men and defining all the rest, of
not proving all the things known by men and proving all the rest. They sin
equally against this order who undertake to define everything and prove everything
and who fail to define and prove those things which are not self-evident.

This is perfectly illustrated by geometry. It does not define space, time, motion,
number, equality, or their like, which are very numerous, because these terms
point out so naturally the things they signify to those who understand the language
that whatever clarification we might want to give would contribute more
obscurity than instruction. For nothing is more ineffectual than the discourse of
those who try to define these primitive words. What need is there, for example,
to explain what we mean by the word *man*? Are we not sufficiently aware of what
the thing is we wish to designate by this term? And what help did Plato think he
was giving us by saying that man was a two-legged animal without feathers? As
if the idea of man I naturally have and cannot express were not clearer and more
certain than that given me by his useless and even ridiculous explanation, since a
man by losing his two legs does not lose his humanity and a capon by losing his
feathers does not take on humanity.

There are even those who go to the absurdity of explaining a word by the
word itself. I know of some who have defined light in this way: '*Light* is a luminary
motion of luminous bodies,' as if we could understand the words luminary
and luminous without understanding the word light [*lumière*].

We cannot undertake to define being without falling into this absurdity, for
we cannot define any word without beginning with these words *it is*, either explicitly
or implicitly. Therefore, to define being we would have to say *it is*, and
thus use the word defined in the definition.

It is sufficiently clear from this that there are words incapable of definition.
And if nature had not made up for this defect by giving a like idea to all men,
all our expressions would be confused; whereas we make use of them with the
same assurance and the same certainty we should have if they had been explained
in a perfectly unambiguous way, because nature itself has given us, without
words, a clearer understanding of them than we gain through art with all our
explanations.

Not that all men have the same idea of the essence of those things I say it is
impossible and useless to define.

For, to take an example, time is of this kind. Who can define it? And why try,
since all men know what we mean when we speak of time, without further designation?
There are nonetheless many different opinions as to the essence of time.
Some say that it is the motion of a created thing; others, the measure of motion,
etc. Therefore it is not the nature of these things that I say is known by all; it is
simply the relation between the name and the thing, so that at the expression
time everyone considers the same object (which is sufficient to make it unnecessary
to define this term) although afterwards, looking into the nature of time, we may
come to have different opinions when we have set ourselves to thinking about it.
For definitions are made only to point out the things named and not to reveal
their nature.

Not that we may not call by the name time the motion of a created thing, for,
as I was just saying, in nothing is there more freedom than in definitions. But as
a result of this definition there will be two things called by the name time: one is
what everybody naturally understands by this word and what all who speak our
language name with this term; the other will be the motion of a created thing,
for this too will be called by that name in accordance with the new definition.
We shall have, therefore, to avoid ambiguity and to keep the consequences separate.
For it will not follow that what we naturally understand by the word time
is in fact the motion of a created thing. We were free to give these two things the
same name, but we shall not therefore be free to make them coincide in nature
as well as in name.

Thus if the proposition is put forward: "Time is the motion of a created thing,"
we must ask what is meant by the word *time*, whether, that is, it keeps its usual
and commonly accepted meaning or whether it has been emptied of that meaning
to receive for this occasion, as its meaning, the motion of a created thing. If it
has been deprived of all other meaning, the statement cannot be contradicted,
and it will be an arbitrary definition with the result, as I have said, that there will
be two things having the same name. But if it has been allowed to keep its usual
meaning and nevertheless it is maintained that what this word means is the motion
of a created thing, the statement can be contradicted. It is no longer an
arbitrary definition; it is a proposition requiring proof unless it is evident of itself,
in which case it will be a principle and an axiom but never a definition, because
in this statement it is not understood that the word *time* signifies the same thing
as the words, the motion of a created thing, but it is understood that what is meant
by the term *time* is this supposed motion.

If I had not known how necessary it is that this should be perfectly understood
and how, in familiar speech as in that of science, occasions like the one I have
given as an example constantly arise, I should not have lingered over it. But it
seems to me, from my experience of the confusion of disputes, that it is im-

[^1]: See Galileo: *Two New Sciences*, pp. 137-8

possible to go too thoroughly into that exactness of mind for the sake of which I am writing this whole treatise more than for the subject I deal with in it.

For how many people are there who think they have defined time when they have said that it is the measure of motion, leaving it meanwhile its usual meaning!

And yet they have made a proposition and not a definition. How many are there likewise who think they have defined motion when they have said: *Motus nec simpliciter actus nec mera potentia est, sed actus entis in potentia*. And nevertheless if they let the word motion keep its usual meaning, as they do, it is not a definition but a proposition; and in this way confounding the definitions they call nominal, which are the true definitions, arbitrary, permissible, and geometrical, with those they call real, which are really propositions by no means arbitrary but subject to contradiction, they take the liberty of making the latter as well as the former; and each defining the same things in his own fashion by a freedom which is as forbidden in this kind of definition as it is permitted in the first, they mix up everything, and losing all order and all light, they lose themselves and wander in a maze of inexplicable difficulties.

We shall never get into such trouble if we follow the order of geometry. That wise science is very far from defining such primitive words as space, time, motion, equality, majority, decrease, all, and those others which the generality of men understand without explanation. But with the exception of these the remaining terms used by geometry are so clarified and defined that we have no need of a dictionary to understand any one of them, so that in a word all these terms are perfectly intelligible either by the natural light or by the definitions given.

This is the way geometry avoids all those vices which may be encountered in connection with the first point, which is to define only those things that need to be defined. It observes the same conduct with respect to the second point, which is to prove those propositions that are not evident. For when geometry has reached the first truths that can be known, it stops there and requires that they be granted since it has nothing clearer to prove them with; so that all the propositions of geometry are perfectly demonstrated either by the natural light or by proofs.

Whence it is that if this science does not define and demonstrate everything, it is only because it is impossible for us to do so. But since nature supplies everything not given by the science, the order of that science, though it does not give a superhuman perfection, has all the perfection men are capable of. It seemed to me fitting at the very beginning of the treatise to give this. . . .

Perhaps it will be thought strange that geometry cannot define any of the things that are its principal objects; for it can define neither motion nor numbers nor space, and yet these are the three things it particularly considers and in accordance with whose investigation it takes the three different names of mechanics, arithmetic, geometry, this last word belonging both to the genus and to the species.

But we shall feel no surprise if we observe that, this admirable science concerning itself only with the simplest things, the very quality which makes them worthy of being its objects makes them incapable of definition; so that the lack of definition is rather a perfection than a defect because it does not come from their obscurity but on the contrary from their extreme evidence, which is such that although it is not so convincing as a demonstration, it is fully as certain. Geometry supposes then that we know what thing is meant by the words: *motion, number, space*; and without stopping uselessly to define them it penetrates their nature and lays bare their marvelous properties.

These three things, which comprise the entire universe, in accordance with the words: *Deus fecit omnia in pondere, in numero et mensura,* are reciprocally and necessarily related. For we cannot imagine a motion without something which moves, and this thing being one, that unity is the origin of all number. Finally, since motion is impossible without space, we see that these three things are contained in the first. Even time is included there too, for motion and time are correlative (fast and slow, which differentiate motion, having a necessary reference to time).

Thus there are properties common to everything, the knowledge of which opens the mind to the greatest marvels of nature.

The most important is constituted by the two infinites which are found everywhere, the infinitely great and the infinitely small.

For however fast a motion may be, we can conceive a faster, and make that still faster, and thus forever to infinity without ever reaching a motion so fast that we can no longer add to it. And on the contrary, however slow a motion may be, we can make it slower, and that still slower, and so to infinity without ever reaching such a degree of slowness that we cannot still descend to an infinity of lower degrees without falling into rest.

Similarly, however great a number may be, we can conceive a greater, and again a greater than that, and so to infinity without ever reaching one which can no longer be increased. And on the contrary, however small a number may be, such as 1/100 or 1/10,000, we can still conceive a smaller, and keep on to infinity without reaching zero or nothing.

However great a space may be, we can conceive a greater, and again a still greater, and so to infinity without ever reaching one which can no longer be increased. And on the contrary, however small a space may be, we can still consider a smaller, and keep on to infinity without ever reaching an indivisible space which no longer has any extension.

It is the same with time. We can always conceive a greater without a last, and a lesser without reaching an instant, a pure nothing of duration.

Which is saying, in a word, that whatever motion, whatever number, whatever space, whatever time we take, there is always a greater and a lesser, so that they all keep between nothing and infinity, being always infinitely distant from these extremes.

None of these truths can be demonstrated, and yet they are the foundations and the principles of geometry. But since the cause that makes them incapable of demonstration is not their obscurity but on the contrary their extreme evidence, this lack of proof is not a defect but rather a perfection.

Whence we see that geometry can neither define its objects nor prove its principles, but for the sole and favorable reason that both have by nature an extreme clarity, which is more powerfully convincing to reason than any discourse.

For what is more evident than this truth, that any number whatsoever can be increased? Can it not be doubled? That the speed of a motion can be doubled, and that a space likewise can be doubled? And also who can doubt that any number whatsoever can be divided in half, and its half again divided in half? For could that half be nothing? And how could these two halves, which would be two zeros, make a number? In the same way cannot the speed of a motion, however slow, be cut down by half so that it will traverse the same space in double the time; and how could it be that these two half-speeds, which would be two rests, should together make the first speed? Finally cannot a space, however small, be cut in two, and its halves again cut? And how could it be that these halves should be indivisible without any extension, these halves, which joined together, made the first extension?

Man has no natural knowledge prior to this knowledge and surpassing it in clarity. Nevertheless, that there may be an example of everything, we find minds excellent in every other respect shocked by these infinites and in no way able to accept them.

I have never known a man who thought a space could not be increased. But I have come across some, and very clever too, who maintained that a space could be divided into two indivisible parts, whatever absurdity might be involved. I tried hard to find the cause of this darkness in them, and I discovered there was only one main cause, which is that they could not conceive an infinitely divisible content, whence they conclude that it is not infinitely divisible.

It is a disease natural to man to believe that he possesses the truth directly, and this is the reason he is always inclined to deny whatever he cannot understand. Whereas in fact he naturally knows nothing but error and should accept as true only those things whose contradictory appears to him to be false. Consequently, whenever a proposition is inconceivable, we must suspend our judgment and not deny it for that reason, but examine its contradictory; and if we find this manifestly false, we may boldly affirm the original statement, however incomprehensible it is. Let us apply this rule to our subject.

There is no geometer who does not believe that space is infinitely divisible. One can no more be a geometer without this principle than one can be a man without a soul. And yet there is no geometer who understands an infinite division. We are sure of that truth only for the reason, certainly sufficient, that we perfectly grasp the falsity of the statement that by dividing a space we can reach an indivisible part, a part, that is, having no extension.

For what is more absurd than to maintain that by continuing to divide a space we finally arrive at a division such that when we divide it in half, each of the halves remains indivisible and without any extension at all, and that thus these two nothings of extension should together make an extension? For I should like to ask those who have this idea whether they distinctly conceive of two indivisibles as touching. If they touch everywhere, they are only one self-same thing; and therefore the two together are indivisible. If they do not touch everywhere, they touch only in part; therefore they have parts; therefore they are not indivisible. But if they confess, as indeed they do when we press them, that their proposition is as inconceivable as the other, let them recognize that it is not by our capacity to conceive these things that we should judge of their truth, since, though the two contradictories are both inconceivable, it is nevertheless necessarily certain that one of the two is true.

But to these imaginary difficulties, related only to our weakness, let them oppose these natural insights and solid truths: if it were true that space is composed of a certain finite number of indivisibles, it would follow that of two spaces, each a square (that is to say, having all its sides equal and similar) but one double the other, one would contain a number of these indivisibles double the number of the other. Let them keep this consequence well in mind, and then let them practise making squares out of points until they have found two of which one has double the points of the other, and then I shall make all the geometers in the world give place to them. But if this is naturally impossible, that is, if there is an invincible impossibility in making squares out of points of which one shall have double the points of the other, as I would demonstrate in this very place if it were worth the time, let them draw the conclusion.

And to comfort them in certain difficulties they would find, as in conceiving a space having an infinity of divisibles (in view of its being traversed in so short a time, during which time that infinity of divisibles would have been traversed), we must warn them that they must not compare things so disproportionate to each other as are the infinity of divisibles and the short time in which they are traversed, but that they should compare the whole of space with the whole of time, and the infinite divisibles of space with the infinite instants of time; and thus they will find we traverse an infinity of divisibles in an infinity of instants, and a little space in a little time, and in this there is no longer the disproportion that had overwhelmed them.

Finally, if it seems strange to them that a small space should have as many parts as a large space, let them also understand that they are proportionately smaller, and let them look at the heavens through a little pane of glass that they may grow familiar with this knowledge by seeing each part of the sky in each part of the glass. But if they cannot comprehend that parts so small as to be imperceptible to us can be divided into as many parts as can the heavens, there is no better remedy than to have them look at these delicate points through glasses which magnify each of them into a prodigious mass. Whence they will easily conceive that with the aid of another lens still more skillfully cut these points could be magnified to equal that firmament whose extent they wonder at. And thus these objects now appearing to them as very easily divisible, let them remember that nature is infinitely more powerful than art. For who has told them *in fine* that these lenses have changed the natural size of the objects or whether they have not, on the contrary, reestablished their true size, changed and shrunk by the shape of our eye as by glasses that make smaller?

It is a nuisance to stop for these trifles, but there are times for being childish.

It is enough to say to heads that are clear in this matter that two nothings of extension cannot make an extension. But because there are some who claim to escape from the light of this truth by the wonderful reply that two nothings of extension can just as well make an extension as two units, neither of which is a number, can, when brought together, make a number, we must reply to them that they could in the same way object that 20,000 men make an army although no one of them is an army, that 1,000 houses make a city though no one of them is a city, or that the parts make the whole though no one of them is the whole, or, to stay within the comparison of numbers, that two dyads make a tetrad and ten decades a century though a dyad is not a tetrad and a decade is not a century. But it is muddleheaded to confuse by comparisons so unequal the unchanging nature of things with their names, which are free, arbitrary, and dependent upon the caprice of those who gave them. For it is clear that to facilitate discourse we have given the name of army to 20,000 men, that of city to several houses, that of decade to ten units, and that from this freedom arise the names *unit, dyad, tetrad, decade, century*, different by the dictates of fancy, although the things referred to are actually of the same kind by their invariable nature and are all related to each other in such a way that they differ only by more and less in spite of the fact that, because of their names, a dyad is not a tetrad, nor a house a city any more than a city is a house. But again although a house is not a city, it is not, nevertheless, a nothing of a city. There is a great difference between not being a thing and being a nothing of it.

For in order that we may understand the matter thoroughly, we must know that the only reason why the unit is not in the class of numbers is that Euclid and the first writers on arithmetic, having several properties to give belonging to all numbers but the unit, in order to avoid repeating that such and such a condition obtains for all numbers but the unit, excluded the unit from the meaning of the word number in accordance with the freedom we have already mentioned of making arbitrary definitions. Also if they had wanted to, they would have excluded the dyad and the triad as well, and anything else they pleased (for we are the masters, provided we give warning); as on the other hand the unit takes its place, if we choose, among the numbers, and the fractions too. And in fact in general propositions we are obliged to consider them there to avoid saying each time: "In every number and in the unit and in fractions such and such a property is found." It is in this indefinite sense I have taken number in all my writings about it. But the same Euclid who took away the name of number from the unit, which was his privilege, to make it clear nevertheless that the unit is not nothing but is, on the contrary, of the same kind, thus defines homogeneous magnitudes:

> "Magnitudes," he says, "are said to be of the same kind when one by being multiplied can be made to exceed the other."

Consequently, since the unit can by being multiplied be made to exceed any number whatsoever, it is of the same kind as numbers precisely by its essence and unchanging nature, according to the same Euclid who would not have it called a number.

An indivisible with respect to an extension is a different matter; for not only does it differ in name, which is arbitrary, but it differs in kind by the above definition, since an indivisible multiplied as many times as we please is so far from being able to exceed an extension that it can never make anything but a single, unique indivisible, which is natural and necessary, as has already been shown. And since this last proof is based on the definition of these two things, indivisible and extension, we shall go on with the demonstration and complete it.

An indivisible is that which is without parts, and extension is that which has distinct separate parts.

On the basis of these definitions I say that two indivisibles when joined do not make an extension. For when they are joined each touches the other in a part; and thus the parts by which they are touching are not separate, since otherwise they would not be touching. However by definition they have no other parts; therefore they have no separate parts; therefore they are not an extension, by the definition which calls for separation of parts. The same thing can be shown by the same argument for all the other indivisibles joined to these. And therefore an indivisible, multiplied as many times as we please, will never make an extension. It is not then of the same kind as extension, by the definition of the same kind.

That is how we demonstrate that indivisibles are not of the same kind as extension. Hence it is that two units can indeed make a number since they are of the same kind, and that two indivisibles do not make an extension since they are not of the same kind. And therefore we see how little reason there is to compare the relation between the unit and numbers to that between indivisibles and extension.

But if we wish to find in numbers a comparison that will justly represent what we are considering in extension, we must take the relation of zero to the numbers, for zero is not of the same kind as numbers because it cannot by being multiplied be made to exceed them; so that zero is a true indivisible of number just as the indivisible is a true zero of extension. And we shall find a like relation between rest and motion, and between an instant and time; for they are all heterogeneous with respect to magnitude because though infinitely multiplied they can never make anything but indivisibles of extension, and for the same reason. And thus we shall find a perfect correspondence between these things; for all these magnitudes are infinitely divisible without ever being reduced to their indivisibles, so that all of them keep the middle ground between infinity and nothing.

Thus wonderfully has nature related these things, and such are the two marvelous infinites she has set before man, not for his mind’s grasp but for its wonder; and to close our consideration of them with a last remark, I shall add that these two infinites, although infinitely different, are nevertheless related to each other in such a way that the knowledge of one necessarily leads to the knowledge of the other.

For in numbers, from the fact that they can always be increased, it follows absolutely that they can always be decreased, and that clearly. For if we can multiply a number up to 100,000 times, say, we can also take a hundred thousandth part of it by dividing it by the same number we multiply it with, and thus every term of increase will become a term of division by changing the integer into a fraction. So that infinite increase includes necessarily infinite division.

In space too we find the same relation between these two opposed infinites. That is to say, from the fact that a space can be infinitely extended, it follows that it can be infinitely diminished, as is apparent from the following example: if we watch through a window a ship moving straight away from us, it is clear that the place in the glass where we see any fixed point we please on the ship will keep rising by a continuous motion as the ship moves away. Therefore if the ship continues its course to infinity, the point will continue to rise, and yet it will never reach the foot of the horizontal line drawn from the eye to the glass, so that it will get closer and closer without ever reaching it, incessantly dividing the space which remains under the horizontal point without ever reaching it. Whence we see that from the infinite extent of the vessel’s course there follows as a necessary consequence the infinite and infinitely small division of the little space remaining below the horizontal point.

Those who will not be satisfied with these reasons and continue in the belief that space is not infinitely divisible can never aspire to geometrical demonstrations, and although they may be enlightened in other things, they will have very little light in these, for it is easy to be a very clever man though a bad geometer. But those who clearly see these truths can admire the greatness and the power of nature in that double infinity which surrounds us on every side, and learn by the consideration of such marvels to know themselves, seeing themselves placed between an infinity and a nothing of extension, between an infinity and a nothing of number, between an infinity and a nothing of motion, between an infinity and a nothing of time. Whereupon we can learn to assess ourselves at our just value and to make reflections worth more than all the rest of geometry itself.

I felt obliged to consider at such length this double infinity for the sake of those who, though they do not understand it at first, can be persuaded of it. And although there are many who have light enough to do without this treatise, it may nevertheless be that, necessary to some, it will not be entirely useless to the rest.

## Section II. Concerning the art of persuasion

The art of persuasion has a necessary relation to the way in which men agree to what we put before them and to the circumstances of the things we want them to believe.

We all know that opinions are admitted into the soul through two entrances, which are its two chief powers, understanding and will. The more natural entrance is the understanding, for we should never agree to anything but demonstrated truths, but the more usual entrance, although against nature, is the will; for all men whatsoever are almost always led into belief not because a thing is proved but because it is pleasing. This way is low, unworthy, and foreign to our nature. Therefore everybody disavows it. Each of us professes to give his belief and even his love only where he knows it is deserved.

I am not speaking here of divine truths, which I am far from bringing under the art of persuasion, for they are infinitely above nature. God alone can put them into the soul, and in whatever way He pleases. I know He has willed they should enter into the mind from the heart and not into the heart from the mind, that He might make humble that proud power of reason, which claims the right to be judge over the things chosen by the will, and that He might cure the infirmity of that will, which is all corruption from its unclean loves. Whence it comes about that, whereas in speaking of human things we say they must be known before they can be loved (which has passed into a proverb), the saints on the contrary say in speaking of divine things that they must be loved in order to be known, and that we enter into truth only through charity, out of which they have made one of their most useful maxims.

Whereby it is apparent that God established this order above nature and entirely opposed to the order which should be natural to men in natural things. Nevertheless they have corrupted this order by dealing with profane things as they ought to deal with sacred things, because actually we believe almost nothing unless it pleases us. And this is why we are so loath to accept the truths of the Christian religion, which is entirely opposed to our pleasures. "Tell us agreeable things and we will listen to you," the Jews said to Moses; as if agreeableness should govern belief! And it is to punish this disorder by an order conformable to it that God sheds His light into our minds only after having tamed the rebelliousness of the will by a heavenly sweetness which charms and seduces it.

I speak then only of truths within our reach, and it is of them that I say the mind and the heart are the gates, as it were, through which they are received into the soul; but very few enter through the mind, whereas they are brought in in crowds through the rash caprices of the will without the counsel of reason.

These powers have each their principles and prime motives of action.

Those of the mind are natural and universally known truths, such as the whole is greater than the part, besides many particular axioms accepted by some and not by others, which, though false, when once admitted, are as powerful to gain belief as are the truest.

The principles of the will are certain desires natural and common to all men, such as the desire to be happy, which it is impossible for anyone not to have, besides many particular objects which each pursues for the sake of happiness and which, although actually pernicious, because they are capable of pleasing us, are as strong to move the will as if they constituted its true happiness.

So much for the powers which induce our consent.

But as for the qualities of the things we are to persuade men of, they differ widely.

Some are drawn as necessary conclusions from common principles and accepted truths. Of these it is possible to persuade without fail, for by showing their relation to principles that have been granted it is inevitably necessary that we convince, and it is impossible for them not to be received into the soul from

# On Geometrical Demonstration

The moment we have been able to join them to those truths already admitted there.

There are others which are bound up with the objects of our satisfaction; and these too are received with certainty. For as soon as the soul is made to see that a thing can bring her to what she sovereignly loves, it is inevitable that she embrace it with joy.

But those which have a double bond, with admitted truths and with the heart’s desires, are so certain of their effect that there is nothing more certain in nature. As on the other hand whatever is related neither to our beliefs nor to our pleasures is importunate to us, false, and completely foreign.

In all these cases there can be no doubt. But there are others where the things we wish to persuade of are firmly based on known truths, but at the same time are opposed to the pleasures which touch us most nearly. And these are in great danger of illustrating by an experience which is all too common what I said at the beginning: that this imperious soul, whose boast was to act only by reason, follows by a rash and shameful choice the desires of a corrupt will, whatever resistance the too enlightened mind may offer.

It is then that truth and pleasure hang doubtfully in the balance, and the knowledge of one and the feeling of the other engage in a struggle whose outcome is most uncertain since, to judge of it, we should have to know all that takes place in the innermost part of a man, which the man himself almost never knows.

Hence it is apparent that, no matter what we wish to persuade of, we must consider the person concerned, whose mind and heart we must know, what principles he admits, what things he loves, and then observe in the thing in question what relations it has to these admitted principles or to these objects of delight. So that the art of persuasion consists as much in knowing how to please as in knowing how to convince, so much more do men follow caprice than reason.

Now of these two, the art of convincing and the art of pleasing, I shall confine myself here to the rules of the first, and to them only in the case where the principles have been granted and are held to unwaveringly; otherwise I do not know whether there would be an art for adjusting the proofs to the inconstancy of our caprices.

But the art of pleasing is incomparably more difficult, more subtle, more useful, and more wonderful, and therefore if I do not deal with it, it is because I am not able. Indeed I feel myself so unequal to its regulation that I believe it to be a thing impossible.

Not that I do not believe there are as certain rules for pleasing as for demonstrating, and that whoever should be able perfectly to know and to practise them would be as certain to succeed in making himself loved by kings and by every kind of person as in demonstrating the elements of geometry to those who have imagination enough to grasp the hypotheses. But I consider, and it is perhaps my weakness that leads me to think so, that it is impossible to lay hold of the rules. At least I am sure that if anyone can, I know the persons, and that no one else has such clear and abundant light in this matter.

The reason for this extreme difficulty comes from the fact that the principles of pleasure are not firm and stable. They are different in all men, and they vary to such an extent in each individual that there is no man who differs more from another man than from himself at different times. A man has other pleasures than a woman has; a rich man and a poor man have different pleasures; a prince, a warrior, a merchant, a citizen, a peasant, the old, the young, the well, the sick, all vary in this respect; the slightest accidents change them.

However there is an art, the one I am going to expound, showing how truths are related to their principles, both of truth and of pleasure, provided the principles we have once admitted remain constant and are never denied.

But since there are few principles of this kind and since outside of geometry, which considers only very simple figures, there are almost no truths we always agree upon, and still fewer objects of pleasure we do not every hour change our mind about, I do not know whether it is possible to give fixed rules for making discourse conform to the inconstancy of our caprices.

The art which I call the art of persuading, and which is simply the management of perfect scientific proofs, consists of three essential parts: defining by clear definitions the terms to be used; laying down evident principles or axioms to prove the matter in question; always mentally substituting in the demonstration, in place of the things defined, their definitions.

The reason for this method is apparent, since it would be useless to put forward something capable of proof and to undertake its demonstration if we had not first clearly defined all unintelligible terms; and since likewise the demonstration must be preceded by the granting of the evident principles required for the demonstration, for if we do not make sure of the foundation, we can have no assurance of the building; and since finally while demonstrating we must mentally substitute the definition in place of the things defined, for otherwise we could be led astray by the different meanings encountered in the terms. It is easy to see that if we observe this method we are sure to convince, since, with all the terms so defined that they are understood and entirely free from ambiguity and with the principles granted, if in the demonstration we always substitute in thought the definitions in place of the things defined, the invincible force of the conclusions cannot fail of its full effect.

Accordingly no demonstration satisfying these conditions can ever have met with a shadow of doubt, and never can those demonstrations failing to satisfy them have any force.

It is very important, therefore, to understand and to appropriate them, and that is why, that they may be more easily grasped and more accessible, I shall give them all in these few rules which include everything necessary for the perfection of definitions, of axioms, and of demonstrations, and consequently of the entire method of geometrical proofs of the art of persuasion.

## Rules for Definitions, Axioms, and Demonstrations

### Rules for Definitions
1. Do not attempt to define any of those things so well known in themselves that we have no clearer terms to explain them by.
2. Do not leave undefined any terms that are at all obscure or ambiguous.
3. Use in the definition of terms only words perfectly well known or already explained.

### Rules for Axioms
1. Do not fail to ask that each of the necessary principles be granted, however clear and evident it may be.
2. Ask only that perfectly self-evident things be granted as axioms.

### Rules for Demonstrations
1. Do not attempt to demonstrate any of those things so self-evident that we have nothing clearer to prove them by.
2. Prove all propositions that are at all obscure, and use for their proof only axioms that are perfectly evident or propositions already granted or demonstrated.
3. Always substitute mentally the definitions in place of the things defined, so you will not be led astray by the equivocation of terms whose meanings have been restricted by the definitions.

These are the eight rules which contain the precepts for firm and abiding proofs, three of which are not absolutely necessary and can be neglected without error. It is even difficult and impossible, as it were, always to observe them exactly, although for the sake of perfection we should do so to the best of our ability. These three are those which come first in each of the divisions:

*   **For the definitions.** Do not define any of the terms that are perfectly well known.
*   **For the axioms.** Do not fail to ask that all the perfectly evident and simple axioms be granted.
*   **For the demonstrations.** Do not demonstrate anything very well known in itself.

For it is undoubtedly not a great fault to define and very clearly to explain things which are most clear in themselves, nor to fail to ask in advance that axioms be granted which no one can refuse to grant when the necessity for their use arises, nor finally to prove propositions which would be granted without proof.

But the five other rules are absolutely necessary, and we cannot dispense with them without an essential defect and frequently even error. That is why I shall repeat them here in detail.

### Necessary Rules for Definitions
*   Do not leave undefined any terms at all obscure or ambiguous.
*   Use in definitions only terms perfectly well known or already explained.

### Necessary Rule for Axioms
*   Ask only that evident things be granted as axioms.

### Necessary Rules for Demonstrations
*   Prove all propositions, using for their proof only axioms that are perfectly self-evident or propositions already demonstrated or granted.
*   Never get caught in the ambiguity of terms by failing to substitute in thought the definitions which restrict or explain them.

These five rules comprise everything necessary for making proofs convincing, unchanging, and in a word, geometrical; and the eight together make them still more perfect.

I pass now to the order in which propositions should be arranged if they are to have the right geometrical sequence.

After having established . . .

These are the rules of the art of persuasion, which are contained in these two principles: Define all the names imposed; prove everything, substituting in thought the definitions in place of the things defined.

Whereupon it seems to me in order to anticipate three chief objections that can be made: first, that this method is not at all new; second, that it is very easy to learn without there being any necessity of studying the elements of geometry, since it consists of these two rules that are known as soon as read; and third, that it is pretty useless since its use is almost confined to the objects of geometry alone.

It must then be shown that there is nothing so little known, nothing harder to practise, and nothing more useful and more universal.

As for the first objection, which is that these rules—everything must be defined and everything proved—are common knowledge in the world and that the logicians themselves have included them among the precepts of their art, I only wish it were true and so well known that I should not have had the labor of seeking with such care for the source of all the defects of reasoning, which are really common. But this is so little the case that with the single exception of geometers, who are so few in number as to be unique among a whole people and over a long period of time, we find no one who knows these rules. It will be easy to make this clear to those who have grasped perfectly the little I have said about them; but if they have not perfectly understood that, I admit they will have nothing to learn in this matter. But if these rules have found a way into their minds and have made a strong enough impression to take root and flourish there, they will feel how great a difference there is between what is said in this place and such approximations to it as some logicians may have made by chance here and there in their works.

Discerning minds know how much difference there is between two similar remarks, depending upon the place and accompanying circumstances. Will anyone really believe that two persons who have read and learned by heart the same book know it equally well, if one understands it in such a way that he knows all its principles, the force of its conclusions, the replies to the objections that can be made, and the entire organization of the work, whereas in the other the book is dead words and seeds which, though the same as those that produced such fertile trees, have remained dry and unfruitful in the sterile mind which received them in vain?

Not all those who say the same things possess them in the same way. And that is why the incomparable author of the *Art of Conversation*[^1] is at such pains to make it clear that we must not judge a man’s capacity by the excellence of an observation we have heard him make. Instead of carrying over to the speaker our admiration of the speech, we should, he says, penetrate the mind it comes from, try and find if he speaks by memory or by a happy chance, listen coldly and scornfully to see if he will resent our not having for what he says the esteem it deserves; we shall find more often than not that he will disavow it on the spot and that, led away from a thought whose worth he does not know, he will fall into another thoroughly common and ridiculous. We must then fathom how that thought is lodged in its author; how, whence, and to what extent he has made it his own; otherwise the judgment, acting in haste, will be judged rash.

I should like to ask fair-minded persons if this principle: "Matter is naturally and invincibly incapable of thought," and this other: "I think, therefore I am," are actually the same in the mind of Descartes and in the mind of St. Augustine, who said the same thing 1,200 years before.

Certainly I am very far from saying that Descartes is not its true author, even if he should have learned it only from the reading of that great saint; for I know how much difference there is between making a statement offhand, without considering it more fully and at length, and seeing in that statement an admirable succession of consequences, which proves that matter is distinct from mind, and making out of it a firm and consistently held principle of a whole physics, as it was the intention of Descartes to do. For without examining whether he was successful in carrying out his intention, I assume that he was, and it is on this assumption that I say the statement in his writings is as different from the same statement in those others who have made it in passing as a man full of life and force is different from a dead man.

One man will say a thing offhand without understanding its excellence where another will see a wonderful succession of consequences which make us say boldly that it is no longer the same observation, and that he no more owes it to him from whom he learned it than a splendid tree belongs to someone who scattered the seed, thoughtlessly and without knowing what it was, in a rich soil which derived this profit from the seed by its own fertility.

The same thoughts sometimes shoot up in another quite otherwise than in their author, unfertile in their native field, abundant when transplanted. But it happens much more often that a good mind itself makes its own thoughts bear all the fruit they are capable of, and that afterwards others, having heard them praised, borrow them and deck themselves out with them, but without knowing their worth; and it is then that the difference of the same observation in different mouths is most apparent.

It is in this fashion that logicians may have borrowed the rules of geometry without understanding their force, and thus it does not follow from their happening to include them among the rules proper to logic that they have entered into the spirit of geometry; and unless they give me other indications of it than the passing mention of these rules, I shall be very far from putting them on the level of that science, which teaches the true method for the conduct of reason. But on the contrary I shall be very much inclined to exclude them, and almost without hope of return. For to have mentioned these rules in passing without noticing that everything is contained in them, and instead of following their light to wander aimlessly in useless investigations, running after what they offer and cannot give, is certainly to show oneself as hardly clearsighted and as having failed to follow the light because one had not seen it.

The method of avoiding error is sought by everyone. The logicians profess to guide us to it, only the geometers reach it, and outside of their science and its imitators there are no true demonstrations. The entire art is contained in these precepts we have given, they alone are sufficient, they alone prove; all other rules are useless or harmful. This is what I have learned from a long experience of all kinds of books and men.

Wherefore I judge those who say that geometers give them nothing new by these rules because they actually had them but mixed up with a lot of others, useless or false, from which they could not separate them out, I judge them, I say, as I do those who, seeking a diamond of great price among many that are false, which they however could not tell from it, should boast, holding them all together, that they possess the diamond as truly as he who, without stopping at the worthless mass, puts his hand on the choice stone they are seeking and for which they did not throw away all the rest.

The defect of false reasoning is a malady which is cured by these two remedies. Another has been compounded of many useless herbs among which the good are mingled but remain without effect because of the bad qualities of the mixture.

To uncover all the sophisms and equivocations of captious arguments they have invented barbarous names which astonish those who hear them; and whereas all the windings of this tangled knot can be straightened out only by pulling one of the ends designated by the geometers, they have noted a monstrous number of others in which these are included, without their knowing which are the right ones.

And thus those who point out to us a number of different roads, which they say will take us where we want to go, although only two of them lead there, must be able to give them a particular mark. It will be said that geometry, which indicates the roads with certainty, only gives what had already been given by the others, because they actually gave the same thing and more, without its being seen that this present lost its value by its very abundance and that by adding they took away.

Nothing is more common than good things; the only question is how to discern them; it is certain that all of them are natural and within our reach and even known by everyone. But we do not know how to distinguish them. This is universal. It is not in things extraordinary and strange that excellence of any kind is found. We reach up for it, and we are further away; more often than not we must stoop. The best books are those whose readers think they could have written them. Nature, which alone is good, is familiar and common throughout.

I have no doubt then that these rules, because they are the true ones, should be simple, *naïve*, natural, as they are. It is not *Barbara* and *Baralipton* which form the reason. We must not force the mind to fly too high. Strained and painful behavior fills it with foolish presumption by giving it an elevation foreign to it and an empty and ridiculous inflation instead of solid and vigorous nourishment. And one of the main reasons which keep those who are beginning these studies out of the true road they ought to follow is the notion they get at the start that the good things are inaccessible because they bear the names: great, high, exalted, sublime. That spoils everything. I should like to call them humble, common, familiar. These names suit them better. I hate those inflated words. . . .

# Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle

## Definitions

I call arithmetical triangle a figure constructed as follows:

From any point, G, I draw two lines perpendicular to each other, GV, Gf, in each of which I take as many equal and contiguous parts as I please, beginning with G, which I number 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., and these numbers are the exponents of the sections of the lines.

Next I connect the points of the first section in each of the two lines by another line, which is the base of the resulting triangle.

In the same way I connect the two points of the second section by another line, making a second triangle of which it is the base.

And in this way connecting all the points of section with the same exponent, I construct as many triangles and bases as there are exponents.

Through each of the points of section and parallel to the sides I draw lines whose intersections make little squares which I call cells.

Cells between two parallels drawn from left to right are called cells of the same parallel row, as, for example, cells G, σ, π, etc., or φ, θ, etc.

Those between two lines drawn from top to bottom are called cells of the same perpendicular row, as, for example, cells G, φ, Δ, D, etc., or σ, θ, B, etc.

Those cut diagonally by the same base are called cells of the same base, as, for example, D, B, θ, χ, or d, ρ, π.

Cells of the same base equidistant from its extremities are called reciprocals, as, for example, E, R and F, φ, because the parallel exponent of one is the same as the perpendicular exponent of the other, as is apparent in the above example, where E is in the second perpendicular row and in the fourth parallel row and its reciprocal, R, is in the second parallel row and in the fourth perpendicular row, reciprocally. It is very easy to demonstrate that cells with exponents reciprocally the same are in the same base and are equidistant from its extremities.

It is also very easy to demonstrate that the perpendicular exponent of any cell when added to its parallel exponent exceeds by unity the exponent of its base.

For example, cell F is in the third perpendicular row and in the fourth parallel row and in the sixth base, and the exponents of rows 3 and 4, added together, exceed by unity the exponent of base 6, a property which follows from the fact that the two sides of the triangle have the same number of parts; but this is understood rather than demonstrated.

Of the same kind is the observation that each base has one more cell than the preceding base, and that each has as many cells as its exponent has units; thus the second base, φσ, has two cells, the third, Δρπ, has three, etc.

Now the numbers assigned to each cell are found by the following method:

The number of the first cell, which is at the right angle, is arbitrary; but that number having been assigned, all the rest are determined, and for this reason it is called the generator of the triangle. Each of the others is specified by a single rule as follows:

The number of each cell is equal to the sum of the numbers of the perpendicular and parallel cells immediately preceding. Thus cell F, that is, the number of cell F, equals the sum of cell C (the cell immediately above F) and cell E (the cell immediately to the left of F), and similarly with the rest.

Whence several consequences are drawn. The most important follow, wherein I consider triangles generated by unity, but what is said of them will hold for all others.

## First Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle all the cells of the first parallel row and of the first perpendicular row are the same as the generating cell.

For by definition each cell of the triangle is equal to the sum of the immediately preceding perpendicular and parallel cells. But the cells of the first parallel row have no preceding perpendicular cells (above them), and those of the first perpendicular row have no preceding parallel cells (to their left); therefore they are all equal to each other and consequently to the generating number.

Thus φ = G + 0 (where 0 represents a non-existent cell), that is, φ = G.
Δ = φ + 0, that is, Δ = φ.
σ = G + 0, that is, σ = G.
π = σ + 0, that is, π = σ.
And similarly of the rest.

## Second Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle each cell is equal to the sum of all the cells of the preceding parallel row from its own perpendicular row to the first, inclusive.

Let any cell, ω, be taken. I say that it is equal to R + θ + π + φ, which are the cells of the next higher parallel row from the perpendicular row of ω to the first perpendicular row.

This is evident if we simply consider a cell as the sum of its component cells.
For ω = R + C (by definition, where R is the cell immediately above ω, and C is the cell immediately to the left of ω).
And C = θ + B (where θ is the cell immediately above C, and B is the cell immediately to the left of C).
And B = π + Δ (where π is the cell immediately above B, and Δ is the cell immediately to the left of B).
And Δ = φ (since Δ is in the first perpendicular row, and φ is the cell immediately above it, which is also in the first perpendicular row, and they are equal by the preceding consequence).
Therefore ω = R + θ + π + φ.

## Third Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle each cell is equal to the sum of all the cells of the preceding perpendicular row from its own parallel row to the first, inclusive.

Let any cell, C, be taken. I say that it is equal to B + ρ + σ, which are the cells of the preceding perpendicular row from the parallel row of cell C to the first parallel row.

This is also apparent, as above, simply by the interpretation of cells.
For C = B + θ (by definition, where B is the cell immediately to the left of C, and θ is the cell immediately above C).
And θ = ρ + σ (where ρ is the cell immediately to the left of θ, and σ is the cell immediately above θ).
And σ = π (since σ is in the first parallel row, and π is the cell immediately to its left, which is also in the first parallel row, and they are equal by the first consequence).
Therefore C = B + ρ + σ.

## Fourth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle each cell exceeds by the generating number the sum of all the cells within the rectangle formed by its parallel and perpendicular rows, exclusive.

Let any cell, ξ, be taken. I say that ξ - G = R + θ + ρ + φ + π + σ + G (where G is the generating cell), which are all the numbers in the rectangle above and to the left of ξ, exclusive of ξ itself.

N.B. I have written in the enunciation "each cell exceeds by unity" because the generator is unity. If it were some other number, the enunciation should read: each cell exceeds by the generating number.

## Fifth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle each cell is equal to its reciprocal.

For in the second base, φσ, it is evident that the two reciprocal cells, φ, σ, are equal to each other and to G.

In the third base, Δρπ, it is also obvious that the reciprocals, π, Δ, are equal to each other and to G, and ρ is equal to itself.

In the fourth base it is obvious that the extremes, D, χ, are again equal to each other and to G.

And those between, B, ρ, are obviously equal since B = π + θ and ρ = θ + Δ. But π = Δ (by the first consequence) and θ = θ. Therefore B = ρ.

Similarly it can be shown for all the other bases that reciprocals are equal, because the extremes are always equal to G and the rest can always be considered as the sum of cells in the preceding base which are themselves reciprocals.

## Sixth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle the corresponding cells of parallel and perpendicular rows having the same exponents are equal.

For they are made up of reciprocal cells.

Thus, the cells of the second perpendicular row (e.g., φ, θ, B, R, S, N) are exactly the same as the corresponding cells of the second parallel row (e.g., σ, ρ, B, E, M, Q), such that φ = σ, θ = ρ, B = B, R = E, S = M, and N = Q.

## Seventh Consequence

[^1]: *Montaigne, Essays*, III, 8.

In every arithmetical triangle the sum of the cells of each base is double that of the preceding base.

Let any base, DBX, be taken. I say that the sum of its cells is double the sum of the cells of the preceding base, Aπ.

For the extremes D, X,
are equal to the extremes A, π,
and each of the rest B, θ,
is equal to two cells of the other base A+ρ, ρ+π,

Therefore D+X+B+θ = 2A + 2ρ+2π.

The same thing is demonstrated in the same way of all other bases.

## Eighth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle the sum of the cells of each base is a number of the double progression beginning with unity whose exponent is the same as that of the base.

For the first base is unity.
The second is double the first; therefore it is 2.
The third is double the second; therefore it is 4.
And so on to infinity.

N.B. If the generator were not unity but some other number, such as 3, the same thing would be true. But we should have to take not the numbers of the double progression beginning with unity, that is, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., but those of the double progression beginning with the generator 3, that is, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc.

## ON THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

451

## Ninth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle each base exceeds by unity the sum of all the preceding bases

For this is a property of the double progression.

N.B. If the generator were other than unity, we should have to say: each base exceeds by the generator.

## Tenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle the sum of any number of contiguous cells of any base, beginning at an extremity, is equal to the same number of cells of the preceding base together with the same number except one.

Let there be taken the sum of any number of cells of base DX, for example the first three, D+E+θ.

I say it is equal to the sum of the first three of the preceding base, A+ρ+π, together with the first two of the same base, A+ρ.

For D,
are equal to A, A+ρ, ρ+π,

Therefore D+E+θ = 2A + 2ρ +π.

## Definition

I call cells of the bisector those diagonally cut by the bisector of the right angle, such as cells G, ρ, C, ρ, etc.

## Eleventh Consequence

Each cell of the bisector is double the preceding cell in its parallel or perpendicular row.

Let any cell of the bisector, C, be taken. I say it is double θ and also double B.
For C = θ+E, and θ = B by the fifth consequence.

N.B. All the preceding consequences are statements of equalities found in the arithmetical triangle. We now proceed to the statements of proportions, of which the following proposition is the foundation.

## Twelfth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle, of two contiguous cells in the same base the upper is to the lower as the number of cells from the upper to the top of the base is to the number of cells from the lower to the bottom of the base, inclusive.

Let any two contiguous cells of the same base, E, C, be taken. I say that
E : C :: 2 : 3
the lower : the upper :: because there are two cells from E to the bottom, namely E, H : because there are three cells from C to the top, namely C, R, ρ.

Although this proposition has an infinity of cases, I shall demonstrate it very briefly by supposing two lemmas:

The first, which is self-evident, that this proportion is found in the second base, for it is perfectly obvious that φ : σ :: 1:1;

The second, that if this proportion is found in any base, it will necessarily be found in the following base.

Whence it is apparent that it is necessarily in all the bases. For it is in the second base by the first lemma; therefore by the second lemma it is in the third base, therefore in the fourth, and to infinity.

It is only necessary therefore to demonstrate the second lemma as follows:
If this proportion is found in any base, as, for example, in the fourth, DX, that is, if D:B::1:3, and B:θ::2:2, and θ:X::3:1, etc., I say the same proportion will be found in the following base, Hμ, and that, for example, E:C::2:3.

For D:B::1:3, by hypothesis.
Therefore E : B :: 1+3 : 3
E : B :: 4:3

Similarly B:θ::2:2, by hypothesis
Therefore C:B::(2+2):2
C : B :: 4 : 2

But B :E:: 3:4
Therefore, by compounding the ratios, C:E::3:2. q.e.d.

The proof is the same for all other bases, since it requires only that the proportion be found in the preceding base, and that each cell be equal to the cell before it together with the cell above it, which is everywhere the case.

## Thirteenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle, of two contiguous cells in the same perpendicular row the lower is to the upper as the exponent of the base of the upper is to the exponent of its parallel row.

Let any two cells in the same perpendicular row, F, C, be taken. I say that
F : C :: the exponent of the base of C : the exponent of the parallel row of C.
the lower : the upper

For E:C::2:3
Therefore E+C:C::(2+3):3
F : C:: 5 :3

## Fourteenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle, of two contiguous cells in the same parallel row the greater is to the lesser as the exponent of the base of the lesser is to the exponent of its perpendicular row.

Let two cells in the same parallel row, F, E, be taken. I say that
F : E :: 5 : 2
The greater : the lesser :: the exponent of the base of E : the exponent of the perpendicular row of E

For E:C::2:3 (by the twelfth consequence) and F:C::5:3 (by the thirteenth consequence).
Therefore, by compounding the ratios, F:E::5:2.

## ON THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

453

## Fifteenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle the sum of the cells of any parallel row is to the last cell of the row as the exponent of the triangle is to the exponent of the row.

Let any triangle, for example the fourth, GDX, be taken. I say that whatever row we take, say the second parallel, the sum of its cells, φ+σ+θ : θ :: 4:2. For φ+σ+θ=C, and C:θ::4:2, by the thirteenth consequence.

## Sixteenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle any parallel row is to the next lower row as the exponent of the lower row is to the number of its cells.

Let any triangle, for example the fifth, μGH, be taken. I say that whatever row we take, say the third, the sum of its cells is to the sum of the cells of the fourth row, that is A+B+C is to D+E as 4, the exponent of the fourth row, is to 2, which is the number of its cells, for it has 2.

For A+B+C=F, and D+E=M.
But F:M::4:2, by the twelfth consequence.

N.B. This proposition could also be enunciated as follows:

Each parallel row is to the next lower row as the exponent of the lower row is to the difference between the exponent of the triangle and the exponent of the upper row.

For the difference between the exponent of a triangle and the exponent of one of its rows is always equal to the number of cells in the next lower row.

## Seventeenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle any cell together with all those of its perpendicular row is to the same cell together with all those of its parallel row as the number of perpendicular cells taken is to the number of parallel cells taken.

Let any cell, B, be taken. I say that B+ρ+σ : B+A :: 3:2.

I say 3 because three cells are added together in the antecedent, and 2 because there are two in the consequent.

For E+θ+σ=C, by the third consequence, and B+A=E, by the second consequence.

But C:E::3:2, by the twelfth consequence.

## Eighteenth Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle two parallel rows equidistant from the extremities are to each other as the number of their cells.

Let there be taken any triangle, GVX, and two of its rows equidistant from the extremities, such as the sixth, P+Q, and the second, φ+σ+θ+P+S+N. I say that the sum of the cells of one is to the sum of the cells of the other as the number of the cells of one is to the number of cells of the other.

For by the sixth consequence the second parallel row, φσθRSN, is the same as the second perpendicular row, σρBEMQ, of which we have just demonstrated this proportion.

454 SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

N.B. This proposition can be enunciated as follows:

In every arithmetical triangle two parallel rows whose exponents taken together exceed by unity the exponent of the triangle are to each other as their exponents reciprocally.

For this is the same thing as what has just been enunciated.

## Last Consequence

In every arithmetical triangle, of two contiguous cells in the bisector the lower is to four times the higher as the exponent of the base of the higher is to a number exceeding it by unity.

Let two cells of the bisector, ρ, C, be taken. I say that ρ:4C::5 (the exponent of the base of C) :6.

For ρ=2ω and C=2θ; therefore 4θ=2C.
Therefore 4θ:C::2:1.
But ρ:4C::ω:4 or in the ratio compounded of ω:C and C:4θ
by the preceding consequences: (5:3) and (1:2)
Therefore ρ:4C::5:6. q.e.d.

N.B. I pass over many other proportions that this triangle could be made to yield, because every one can easily discover them for himself and because those who are willing to devote themselves to the task will perhaps find more admirable ones than any I could give. I end therefore with the following problem, which completes the treatise:

## Problem

Given the perpendicular and parallel exponents of a cell, to find its number without making use of the arithmetical triangle.

Let it be proposed, for example, to find the number of cell E of the fifth perpendicular and of the third parallel row.

All the numbers which precede the perpendicular exponent, 5, having been taken, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, let there be taken the same number of natural numbers, beginning with the parallel exponent, 3, namely 3, 4, 5, 6.

Let the first numbers be multiplied together and let the product be 24. Let the second numbers be multiplied together and let the product be 360, which, divided by the first product, 24, gives as quotient 15, which is the number sought.

For E is to the first cell of its base, V, in the ratio compounded of all the ratios of the cells between, that is to say, E:V
in the ratio compounded of E:ρ, ρ:K, K:Q, Q:V
or by the twelfth consequence 3:4 4:3 5:2 6:1

Therefore E:V::(3*4*5*6):(4*3*2*1).

But V is unity; therefore E is the quotient of the division of the product of 3*4*5*6 by the product of 4*3*2*1.

N.B. If the generator were not unity, we should have had to multiply the quotient by the generator.

## VARIOUS USES OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE WHOSE GENERATOR IS UNITY

Having given the proportions obtaining between the cells and the rows of arithmetical triangles, I turn in the following treatises to various uses of those triangles whose generator is unity. But I leave out many more than I include; it is extraordinary how fertile in properties this triangle is. Everyone can try his hand. I only call your attention here to the fact that in everything that follows I am speaking exclusively of arithmetical triangles whose generator is unity.

## USE OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE FOR THE ORDERS OF NUMBERS

The numbers of the different progressions have been considered in arithmetic; those of the different powers and of the different degrees have also been considered; but those of which I am speaking have not, it seems to me, been sufficiently investigated, although they are extremely useful. They do not even have a name; therefore I have been obliged to give them one. Because *progression*, *degree*, and *power* are already in use, I adopt the name *order*.

I call therefore numbers of the first order the units,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, etc.

I call numbers of the second order the natural numbers which are formed by addition of the units,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

I call numbers of the third order, known as triangular numbers, those which are formed by addition of the natural numbers,
1, 3, 6, 10, etc.

That is, the second triangular number, 3, is equal to the sum of the first two natural numbers, which are 1, 2; the third triangular number, 6, is equal to the sum of the first three natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc.

I call numbers of the fourth order, known as pyramidal numbers, those which are formed by addition of the triangular numbers,
1, 4, 10, 20, etc.

I call numbers of the fifth order those which are formed by addition of the preceding numbers. Since there is no fixed name for them, they might be called *triangulo-triangular* numbers:
1, 5, 15, 35, etc.

I call numbers of the sixth order those which are formed by addition of the preceding numbers,
1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, etc.

And so on to infinity, 1, 7, 28, 84, etc.
1, 8, 36, 120, etc.

Now if we make a table of all the orders of numbers in which we indicate the exponents of the orders at the side and the roots at the top, as follows:

Roots
      1   2   3   4   5   etc.
Units. Order 1  1   1   1   1   1   etc.
Natural numbers. Order 2  1   2   3   4   5   etc.
Triangular numbers. Order 3  1   3   6   10  15  etc.
Pyramidal numbers. Order 4  1   4   10  20  35  etc.
etc.

we shall find this table equivalent to the arithmetical triangle.

The first order of numbers will be the same as the first parallel row of the triangle.

456 SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

The second order of numbers will be the same as the second parallel row, and so on to infinity.

For in the arithmetical triangle the first row is wholly made up of units, and the first order of numbers is also made up of units.

Also in the arithmetical triangle each cell, say F, is equal to the cell above together with all the preceding cells in that parallel, that is, C+B+A, as was proved in the second consequence of the treatise on this triangle. And we find the same thing in each order of numbers. For example, the third pyramidal number, 10, is equal to the first three triangular numbers, 1, 3, 6, since it is formed by their addition.

Whence it is plainly seen that the parallel rows of the triangle are nothing but the orders of numbers, and that the exponents of the parallel rows are the same as the exponents of the orders, and that the exponents of the perpendicular rows are the same as the roots. Thus, for example, the number 21, which in the arithmetical triangle is in the third parallel row and in the sixth perpendicular row, when considered with respect to the orders of numbers, is of the third order and the sixth of its order, or of the sixth root.

Which makes it clear that everything we have said of the rows and cells of the arithmetical triangle applies exactly to the orders of numbers, and that the same equalities and the same proportions we pointed out in the former will also be found in the latter. We need only change the enunciations by substituting the terms which apply to the orders of numbers, such as root and order, for those which applied to the arithmetical triangle, such as parallel and perpendicular rows. I shall devote a separate little treatise to the subject; a few examples given there will make it easy to see what all the rest would be.

## USE OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE FOR COMBINATIONS

The word combination has been used in several different senses, so that to avoid ambiguity I am obliged to say how I understand it.

When of many things we may choose a certain number, all the ways of taking as many as we are allowed out of all those offered to our choice are here called the different combinations.

For example, if of four things expressed by the four letters, A, B, C, D, we are permitted to take, say any two, all the different ways of taking two out of the four put before us are called combinations.

Thus we shall find by experience that there are six different ways of choosing two out of four; for we can take A and B, or A and C, or A and D, or B and C, or B and D, or C and D.

I do not count A and A as one of the ways of taking two; for they are not different things, they are only one thing repeated.

Nor do I count A and B and B and A as two different ways; for in both ways we take only the same two things but in a different order, and I am not concerned with the order; so that I could make myself understood at once by those who are used to considering combinations, simply by saying that I speak only of combinations made without changing the order.

We shall also find by experience that there are four ways of taking three things out of four; for we can take ABC or ABD or ACD or BCD.

Finally we shall find that we can take four out of four in one way only, ABCD.

457

## ON THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

I shall speak therefore in the following terms:

1 in 4 can be combined 4 times.
2 in 4 can be combined 6 times.
3 in 4 can be combined 4 times.
4 in 4 can be combined 1 time.

Or:
the number of combinations of 1 in 4 is 4.
the number of combinations of 2 in 4 is 6.
the number of combinations of 3 in 4 is 4.
the number of combinations of 4 in 4 is 1.

But the sum of all the combinations in general that can be made in 4 is 15, because the number of combinations of 1 in 4, of 2 in 4, of 3 in 4, of 4 in 4, when joined together, is 15.

After this explanation I shall give the following consequences in the form of lemmas:

### Lemma 1.

There are no combinations of a number in a smaller number; for example, 4 cannot be combined in 2.

### Lemma 2.

There is 1 combination of 1 in 1.
There is 1 combination of 2 in 2.
There is 1 combination of 3 in 3.
And in general there is only one combination of a number in an equal number.

### Lemma 3.

There is 1 combination of 1 in 1.
There are 2 combinations of 1 in 2.
There are 3 combinations of 1 in 3.
And in general there are as many combinations of 1 in any number as there are units in the number.

### Lemma 4.

If there are four numbers, the first of which is arbitrary, the second exceeding the first by unity, the third any number not smaller than the second, the fourth exceeding the third by unity, the number of combinations of the first in the third together with the number of combinations of the second in the third is equal to the number of combinations of the second in the fourth.

Let there be four numbers as specified:
The first, arbitrary, for example, 1.
The second, exceeding the first by unity, 2.
The third, not smaller than the second, for example, 3.
The fourth, exceeding the third by unity, 4.

I say that the number of combinations of 1 in 3 together with the number of combinations of 2 in 3 is equal to the number of combinations of 2 in 4.

Let there be taken any three letters, B, C, D.
Let there be taken the same three letters together with another, A, B, C, D.

458 SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

Let us take, in accordance with the proposition, all the combinations of one letter in the three, B, C, D. There will be 3, namely, B, C, D.

Let us take in the same three letters all the combinations of two. There will be 3, namely, BC, BD, CD.

Finally let us take in the four letters, A, B, C, D, all the combinations of two. There will be 6, namely, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

We must demonstrate that the number of combinations of 1 in 3 and of 2 in 3 is equal to the number of combinations of 2 in 4.

The demonstration is easy for the combinations of 2 in 4 are made up of the combinations of 1 in 3 and of 2 in 3.

That this may be seen, it is necessary to observe that among the combinations of 2 in 4, namely, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, some have the letter A and some do not.

Those not having it are BC, BD, CD, which consequently are made up of two of the three letters, B, C, D; therefore they are the combinations of 2 in the three letters, B, C, D. Therefore the combinations of 2 in the three letters, B, C, D, constitute a part of the combinations of 2 in the four letters, A, B, C, D, since they are made up of those not having A.

Now if from the combinations of 2 in 4 having A, namely, AB, AC, AD, we take away A, there will remain one letter only of the three, B, C, D, namely, B, C, D, which are precisely the combinations of one letter in the three letters, B, C, D. Therefore if to each of the combinations of one letter in the three letters, B, C, D, we add the letter A, thus having AB, AC, AD, we shall make the combinations of 2 in 4 having A. Therefore the combinations of 1 in 3 constitute a part of the combinations of 2 in 4.

Whence it is seen that the combinations of 2 in 4 are made up of the combinations of 2 in 3 and of 1 in 3, and therefore that the number of the combinations of 2 in 4 is equal to that of 2 in 3 and of 1 in 3.

We can show the same thing in all the other examples, as:
The number of combinations of 29 in 40
and the number of combinations of 30 in 40
are equal to the number of combinations of 30 in 41.

Also the number of combinations of 15 in 55
and the number of combinations of 16 in 55
are equal to the number of combinations of 16 in 56

and so on to infinity. Q.E.D.

## Proposition 1

In every arithmetical triangle the sum of any parallel row of cells is equal to the number of combinations of the exponent of the row in the exponent of the triangle.

Let any triangle, for example, the fourth, GDX, be taken. I say that the sum of the cells of any row, for example, the second, is equal to the number of combinations of 2, the exponent of the second row, in 4, the exponent of the triangle.

Similarly the sum of the cells of the fifth row of the eighth triangle is equal to the number of combinations of 5 in 8, etc.

Although there is an infinity of cases, the demonstration can be briefly given by means of the two following lemmas:

## ON THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

459

The first, which is self-evident, that this equality is found in the first triangle since the sum of the cells of its only row, namely G or unity, is equal to the number of combinations of 1, the exponent of the row, in 1, the exponent of the triangle;

The second, that if an arithmetical triangle is found which has this equality, namely, that whatever row we take, the sum of the cells is equal to the number of combinations of the exponent of the row in the exponent of the triangle, I say that the following triangle will have the same property.

Whence it follows that all the arithmetical triangles have this equality. For the first has it by the first lemma, and it is even still evident in the second; therefore by the second lemma the next triangle will have it too, and consequently the next, and so on to infinity.

All that is necessary then is to demonstrate the second lemma.

Let any triangle be taken, for example, the third, in which we suppose this equality, namely, that the sum of the cells of the first row, GH+θ+π, is equal to the number of combinations of 1 in 3, and that the sum of the cells of the second row, φ+ρ, is equal to the combinations of 2 in 3, and that the sum of the cells of the third row, A, is equal to the combinations of 3 in 3; I say that the fourth triangle will have the same equality, and that, for example, the sum of the cells of the second row, φ+σ+θ, is equal to the number of combinations of 2 in 4.

For φ+σ+θ (sum of cells of the second row of the fourth triangle)
= (sum of cells of the second row of the third triangle) + (sum of cells of the first row of the third triangle)
By hypothesis, this is equal to:
(the number of combinations of 2 in 3) + (the number of combinations of 1 in 3)
By the fourth lemma, this sum is equal to the number of combinations of 2 in 4.

The same demonstration applies to all other cases. Q.E.D.

## Proposition 2

The number of any cell is equal to the number of combinations of a number less by unity than its parallel exponent in a number less by unity than the exponent of its base.

Let any cell be taken, say F in the fourth parallel row and in the sixth base. I say that it is equal to the number of combinations of 3 in 5, less by unity than 4 and 6, for it is equal to the cells A+B+C. Therefore by the preceding proposition, etc.

## Problem 1, Proposition 3

Two numbers having been set out, to find by the arithmetical triangle how many combinations there are of one in the other.

Let the numbers set out be 4, 6. We must find how many combinations there are of 4 in 6.

First way. Take the sum of the cells of the fourth row in the sixth triangle; it will satisfy the problem.

Second way. Take the fifth cell of the seventh base, because the numbers, 5, 7, exceed by unity the given numbers, 4, 6; the number of this cell is the required number.

460 SCIENTIFIC TREATISES

## Conclusion

It is easy to see from the relation between the cells and the rows of the arithmetical triangle and combinations that everything proved of the former applies to the latter analogously, as I shall show in a few words in a little treatise I have written on combinations.

## USE OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

### To determine how the stakes should be divided between two players playing for a set of games

To understand the rules of divisions the first thing to consider is that the money staked by the players on the game no longer belongs to them, for they have given up its ownership. But they have received in return the right to expect whatever chance may give them, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the beginning.

But since the law by which they are playing is voluntary, they can break it at will; and therefore at any stage of the game they can stop, and reversing their procedure at the beginning, give up their expectations from chance and each return to the ownership of something. In this event the determination of what is to belong to them should be so related to what they had a right to hope from fortune that each of them thinks it comes to exactly the same thing to take what is assigned to him or to continue to run the risks of the game; this just distribution is called the division (of the stakes).

The first principle leading to a knowledge of how divisions should be made is as follows:

If the position of a player is such that whatever happens a certain sum is to belong to him whether he wins or loses and chance cannot take it from him, he should not divide it but take the whole of it as having been assured to him. Since the division should vary as the chances and since there is no chance of losing, he should withdraw the entire sum without division.

The second principle is as follows: If the position of two players is such that if one wins, a certain sum will belong to him, and if he loses, it will belong to the other; if the game is a game of pure chance and if there are as many chances for one as for the other and consequently no more reason why one should win than the other, if they want to separate without playing and take what legitimately belongs to them, they should divide equally the sum ventured and each take his half.

### FIRST COROLLARY

If two players are playing a game of pure chance on condition that if the first player wins, a certain sum will be his, and if he loses, a smaller sum will be his, and if they wish to separate without playing and each take what belongs to him, the division is that

the first player take what would be his if he lost, together with half the difference between that and what would be his if he won.

For example, if two players are playing on condition that if the first wins, he will get 8 pistoles, and if he loses, 2, I say the division is that he take the 2 together with half the difference between 8 and 2, that is, 3, for the difference is 6, half of which is 3.

For by hypothesis if he wins, he gets 8, that is, 6+2, and if he loses, 2; therefore 2 belongs to him in either case and consequently by the first principle he should not divide them but take them both. But as for the other 6, they depend on fortune, so that if it favors him, they are his, if not, they belong to his opponent; and by hypothesis there is no more reason for their going to one than to the other. Therefore they should divide them evenly and each take his half, which is what I had proposed.

Therefore, to say the same thing in other words, he gets his share as loser together with half the difference between his shares as loser and as winner.

And consequently if, when he loses, *A* is his, and when he wins, *A*+*B*, the division is that he get *A*+½*B*.

## SECOND COROLLARY

If two players are playing in the same condition as stated above, I say that the division can be made as follows, which comes to the same thing: that the winner's and the loser's shares be put together and that the first player take half of this sum; that is, that 2 and 8 be added together to make 10, half of which, 5, will belong to the first player.

For half of the sum of two numbers is always the same as the smaller together with half of their difference.

Which is demonstrated as follows:

Let *A* be the loser's share and *A*+*B* the winner's share. I say the division is made by adding these two numbers, which make *A*+*A*+*B*, and giving half to the first player, which is ½*A* + ½*A* + ½*B*. For this sum is equal to *A*+½*B*, which has been proved to be the just distribution.

These foundations having been laid, we shall proceed with ease to determine the division between two players who are playing for a set of any number of games, whatever their actual status; that is, what the division should be when they are playing for a set of two games with a score of 1 to 0, or for a set of three games with a score of 1 to 0 or 2 to 0 or 2 to 1; and in general whatever the number of games in the set and whatever the score of the players.

The first observation to make is that two players who are playing for a set of two games with a score of 1 to 0 are in the same position as two others who are playing for a set of three games with a score of 2 to 1. For both couples have this in common that in order to win, one player needs only one game and the other, two. And therein consist the odds, which should determine divisions; so that strictly only the number of games left for each to win should be considered and not the number won, since, as we have already said, two players playing for a set of two games with a score of 1 to 0 have the same status as two players playing for a set of twelve games with a score of 11 to 10.

The question must accordingly be put as follows:

Given two players each of whom lacks a certain number of games to complete the set, to make the division.

I shall give the method here, which I shall carry out only in two or three examples, which will be so easy to go on with that there will be no need of more.

For the sake of completeness I shall start with the first example, which it is perhaps inappropriate to mention because it is too clear. I do so, however, to begin with the beginning.

### FIRST CASE

If one of the players has the required number of games and the other has not, the whole sum belongs to the first player; for he has won it, since he lacks none of the games in which he was to win it.

### SECOND CASE

If one of the players lacks one game and the other one, they should divide the money equally and each take his half as is evident by the second principle. It is the same if one lacks two games and the other two, and whatever number of games one lacks if the other lacks as many.

### THIRD CASE

If one player lacks one game and the other two, the division is determined as follows:

Let us consider what would belong to the first player (who lacks only one game) if he should win the next game, and then what would belong to him if he lost.

It is obvious that if the player who lacks only one game wins the game to be played, he will not lack any; therefore the entire sum will belong to him by the first case. But on the contrary if the player who lacks two games wins the one to be played, he will only lack one; therefore each will be in the position of lacking one game. Therefore they should divide the money equally by the second case.

Therefore if the first wins this game, the entire sum will belong to him, and if he loses it, half will be his; therefore if they wish to separate without playing the game, ¾ will belong to him by the second corollary.

And if we give an example of the sum they are playing for, the matter will be much clearer.

Let us say 8 pistoles; therefore the first player, if he wins, should have it all, that is, 8 pistoles, and if he loses, half, that is 4; therefore in case of division half of 8+4, that is, 6 pistoles out of 8, belong to him; for 8+4=12, half of which is 6.

### FOURTH CASE

If one of the players lacks one game and the other three, the division will be found similarly by investigating what belongs to the first player if he wins and if he loses.

If he wins, he will have all his games and consequently all the money, which is, for example, 8.

If the first player loses, the second player who lacked three games will now lack only two. Therefore their status will be that the first player lacks one game and the second player two; consequently by the preceding case 6 pistoles will belong to the first.

Therefore if he wins, he should have 8, and if he loses, 6; therefore in case of division half of these two sums belongs to him, that is, 7; for 6+8=14, half of which is 7.

### FIFTH CASE

If one of the players lacks one game and the other four, the method is the same.

The first, if he wins, wins the entire sum, which is, for example, 8; if he loses, he lacks one game to the other's three; therefore 7 pistoles out of 8 belong to him. Therefore in case of division half of 8 plus half of 7 belong to him, that is, 7½.

### SIXTH CASE

Similarly if one player lacks one game and the other five, and so on to infinity.

### SEVENTH CASE

The same method applies if the first player lacks two games and the second three, for we must always examine the results of winning and of losing.

If the first player wins, he will lack one game to the second player’s three; therefore by the fourth case 7 out of 8 will belong to him.

If he loses, both players will lack two games; therefore by the second case half, that is, 4, belongs to each. Therefore the first player will have 7 if he wins and 4 if he loses; therefore in case of division he will get half of the two together, that is, 5½.

In this way we shall determine the divisions for every kind of situation by always taking what belongs to the first player if he wins and what belongs to him if he loses and assigning to him in case of division half of these two sums.

This is one method of determining divisions.

There are two others, one by the arithmetical triangle and the other by combinations.

## METHOD FOR DIVIDING THE STAKES BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS WHO ARE PLAYING FOR A SET OF GAMES BY MEANS OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE

Before giving the method we must demonstrate the following lemma:

### Lemma

If two players are playing a game of pure chance on condition that if the first player wins, there will belong to him some part of the sum they are playing for, expressed by a fraction, and that if he loses, there will belong to him a smaller part of the same sum, expressed by another fraction; if they wish to separate without playing, the division will be determined as follows: If the two fractions are not of the same denomination, let them be reduced to a common denominator. Let a fraction be taken whose numerator is the sum of the two numerators and whose denominator is double the common denominator. This fraction expresses the part of the sum at stake belonging to the first player.

For example, let 2/5 of the stakes belong to him if he wins and 3/5 if he loses. I say that what belongs to him in case of division will be found by taking the sum of the numerators, which is 4, and double the denominator, which is 10, and out of them making the fraction 4/10.

For by what was demonstrated in the second corollary we had to add the cases of winning and losing and take half the sum. Now the sum of the two fractions 2/5 and 3/5 is 5/5, which is obtained by adding the numerators, and half the sum is got by doubling the denominator, and thus we have 5/10. *Q.E.D.*

Now these rules are general and without exception, whatever comes from winning or losing; for if, for example, 1/2 belongs to a player if he wins and nothing if he loses, by reducing the two fractions to the same denominator, we shall have 2/4 if he wins and 0/4 if he loses; therefore in case of division the required fraction is 2/8, whose numerator is equal to the sum of the other two and whose denominator is double theirs.

Similarly if the entire sum belongs to a player if he wins and 1/2 if he loses, reducing the fractions to a common denominator, we shall have 1/1 if he wins and 1/2 if he loses; therefore in case of division 3/4 belongs to him.

Similarly if the entire sum belongs to a player if he wins and nothing if he loses, the division will obviously be 1/2; for winning gives 1/1 and losing 0/1; therefore the division is 1/2.

And similarly for all possible cases.

### Problem 1, Proposition 1

Given two players each of whom lacks a certain number of games to complete the set, to find by the arithmetical triangle what the division should be (if they wish to separate without playing) in the light of the games each lacks.

Let there be taken in the triangle the base which has as many cells as the two players together lack games; then let there be taken in this base as many contiguous cells beginning with the first as the first player lacks games, and let the sum of their numbers be taken. Therefore there remain as many cells as the second player lacks games. Again let the sum of their numbers be taken. These sums are to each other as the odds of the players reciprocally, so that if the sum at stake is equal to the sum of the numbers of all the cells of the base, there will belong to each player that part of it contained in as many cells as the other lacks games. And if they are playing for other stakes, their shares will be proportional.

For example, let there be two players, one of whom lacks two games and the other four, to find the division.

Let there be added together the two numbers, 2 and 4, and let their sum be 6. Let the sixth base of the arithmetical triangle be taken, *Pδ*, in which there are consequently six cells, *P, M, F, ω, S, δ*. Let there be taken as many cells beginning with the first, *P*, as the first player lacks games, that is to say, the first two, *P, M*. Therefore there remain as many cells as the second player lacks games, that is, four, *F, ω, S, δ*.

I say that the odds of the first player are to the odds of the second player as *F+ω+S+δ* is to *P+M*, which is to say that if the sum at stake is equal to *P+M+F+ω+S+δ*, the sum of the four cells, *δ+S+ω+F*, belongs to the player who lacks two games, the sum of the two cells, *P+M*, to the player who lacks four games. And if they are playing for other stakes, their shares will be proportional.

And to speak generally, whatever the sum at stake, the share of the first player is expressed by the fraction (F+ω+S+δ) / (P+M+F+ω+S+δ), of which the numerator is the sum of the second player’s four cells and the denominator the sum of all the cells.

And the share of the second player is expressed by the fraction (P+M) / (P+M+F+ω+S+δ), of which the numerator is the sum of the first player's two cells and the denominator again the sum of all the cells.

And if one player lacks one game and the other five, the share of the first player is the sum of the first five cells, (P+M+F+ω+S), and the share of the second player is cell *δ*.

And if one player lacks six games, and the other two, the division will be found in the eighth base, in which the first six cells contain the share of the player who lacks two games and the other two the share of the player who lacks six, and so on to infinity.

Although this proposition has an infinity of cases, I shall nevertheless demonstrate it in a few words by means of two lemmas.

The first lemma is that the second base contains the divisions of the players who lack two games in all.

The second lemma is that if any base contains the divisions of those lacking as many games as the base has cells, the next base will do the same, that is, it too will contain the divisions of the players lacking as many games as the base has cells.

From which I conclude, in a word, that all the bases of the arithmetical triangle have this property; for the second base has it by the first lemma; therefore by the second lemma the third base has it too, and consequently the fourth, and so on to infinity. *Q.E.D.*

We have then only to demonstrate these 2 lemmas.

The first is self-evident; for if each player lacks one game, it is evident that their positions are to each other as *φ* to *ψ*, that is, as 1 to 1, and that the share of each is expressed by the fraction 1/2.

The second lemma is demonstrated as follows:

If any base, such as the fourth, *DX*, contains the divisions of those lacking four games, that is to say that if the first player lacks one and the second three, the share of the stakes belonging to the first is expressed by the fraction (D+B+θ) / (D+B+θ+X), which has as denominator the sum of the cells of the base and as numerator the first three cells; and that if both players lack two games, the fraction belonging to the first is (D+B) / (D+B+θ+X), and that if the first player lacks three games and the second one, the fraction of the first is D / (D+B+θ+X), etc.

I say that the fifth base also contains the divisions of those lacking five games, and that if, for example, the first player lacks two games and the second player three, the share of the stakes belonging to the first is expressed by the fraction (H+E+C) / (H+E+C+R+P).

For to know what belongs to two players each of whom is lacking in games, we must take the fraction which would belong to the first player if he won and that which would belong to him if he lost, and if they are not of the same denomination, reduce them to a common denominator, then form a fraction of which the numerator is the sum of the two others and the denominator double the other, by the preliminary lemma.

Let us examine then the fraction which would belong to the first player if he won and if he lost.

If the first player, who lacks two games, wins the one to be played, he will lack only one and the second player will still lack three; therefore they will lack four games in all; therefore by hypothesis their division is found in the fourth base, and the share of the first will be the fraction (D+B+θ) / (D+B+θ+X).

If on the contrary the first player loses, he will still lack two games and the second player will also lack only two; therefore by hypothesis the fraction of the first will be (D+B) / (D+B+θ+X). Therefore in case of division the fraction of the first player will be (D+B+θ+D+B) / (2D+2B+2θ+2X), that is (H+E+C) / (H+E+C+R+P). *Q.E.D.*

This is also demonstrated in the same way of all the other bases, because the foundation of this proof is that a base is always double the preceding base by the seventh consequence and that by the tenth consequence any number of cells of the same base is equal to the same number of cells of the preceding base (which is always the numerator of the player’s fraction if he wins) together with the same cells lacking one (which is the numerator of the player’s fraction if he loses); which being everywhere true in general, the demonstration is always possible and universal.

### Problem 2, Proposition 2

Given two players each of whom stakes the same sum on a given number of games, to find in the arithmetical triangle the part of the loser's money that the last game is worth to the winner.

For example, let two players each stake three pistoles on four games; we want to find what part of the loser’s 3 pistoles the last game is worth to the winner.

Let there be taken the fraction of which the numerator is unity and the denominator the sum of the cells of the fourth base, since the set has four games; I say that this fraction is the value of the last game in terms of the loser’s money.

For if when two players are playing for a set of four games, one has three games to his credit and thus lacks one game and the other lacks four, it has been demonstrated that the share of the first player for winning his first three games is expressed by the fraction (H+E+C+R) / (H+E+C+R+μ), which has as denominator the sum of the cells of the fifth base and as numerator its first four cells; therefore there remains of the entire sum of the two stakes only the fraction μ / (H+E+C+R+μ), which would belong to the player who already has the first three games if he won the last; the value of this last in terms of the whole stakes is μ / (H+E+C+R+μ), that is, 1 / (2D+2B+2θ+2X).

But since the entire amount of the stakes is 2D+2B+2θ+2X, the amount of each stake is D+B+θ+X; therefore the value of the last game in terms of the loser’s stake only is the fraction 1 / (D+B+θ+X), double the preceding fraction, having as numerator unity and as denominator the sum of the cells of the fourth base. *Q.E.D.*

### Problem 3, Proposition 3

Given two players each of whom stakes the same amount on a given number of games, to find in the arithmetical triangle the part of the loser's money represented by the value of the first game.

For example, let two players each stake 3 pistoles on four games; we want to find what part of the loser’s stake the first game is worth to the winner.

Let there be added to the number 4 the number 3, less than it by unity, and let the sum be 7. Let there be taken the fraction which has as denominator the cells of the seventh base and as numerator the cell of the base cut by the bisector, that is, the fraction P / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F). I say that this fraction satisfies the problem.

For if when two players are playing for a set of four games the first player has one game to his credit, he will have three more to win and the second player will have four. Therefore the first player’s share of the whole amount of the stakes is the fraction (V+Q+K+P) / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F), which has as denominator all the cells of the seventh base and as numerator its first four cells.

Therefore V+Q+K+P belongs to him out of the whole amount of the two stakes, expressed by V+Q+K+P+H+N+F; but since this latter amount is the sum of the two stakes, he had himself staked half of it, namely V+Q+K+P (for V+Q+K=F+N+H).

Therefore he has P, that is, *ω*, more than he had at the beginning of the game; therefore he has won a portion of the total amount of the two stakes expressed by the fraction ω / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F). Therefore he has won a portion of the loser’s stake double the above, namely, a portion expressed by the fraction P / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F).

Therefore winning the first game has given the player that fraction, which is accordingly its value.

### Corollary

Therefore the part of the loser's stake constituting the value of the first game out of two is expressed by the fraction ½.

For to determine this value in accordance with the rule just given we must take the fraction which has as denominator the cells of the third base (because the number of games in the set is 2 and the number less by unity is 1, which taken together make 3), and as numerator the cell in the base cut by the bisector; therefore we shall have the fraction P / (A+P+π).

But the number of cell P is 2, and the numbers of cells A, P, π are 1, 2, 1; therefore we have the fraction 2 / (1+2+1), that is, ½.

Therefore winning the first game has given the player that fraction, which is accordingly its value. *Q.E.D.*

### Problem 4, Proposition 4

Given two players each of whom stakes the same sum on a given number of games, to find by the arithmetical triangle the value of the second game in terms of the loser's stake.

Let the number of games in the set be four; we must find the value of the second game in terms of the loser’s stake.

Let the value of the first game be found by the preceding problem. I say that the value of the second game is the same.

For when two players are playing for four games if one of them has two to his credit, the fraction belonging to him is (P+M+F+ω) / (P+M+F+ω+S+δ), which has as denominator the sum of the cells of the sixth base and as numerator the sum of the first four. But he had staked the fraction (P+M+F+ω+S+δ) / 2, that is, half of the whole amount. Therefore his winnings are the fraction δ / (P+M+F+ω+S+δ), which is the same as P / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F); therefore he has won out of half the whole amount, that is, the loser’s stake, the fraction P / (V+Q+K+P+H+N+F), double the preceding fraction.

Therefore winning the first two games gave him this fraction of the loser’s money, which is double what the first game gave him by the preceding problem. Therefore the second game gave him as much as the first.

## Conclusion

We easily conclude from the relation of the arithmetical triangle to the divisions which should be made between two players that the proportions between cells given in the *Treatise on the Triangle* have consequences extending to the value of divisions, very easy to draw, about which I have written a little treatise dealing with divisions, which explains why and how further extensions can be made.

## USE OF THE ARITHMETICAL TRIANGLE TO FIND THE POWERS OF BINOMIALS

If it is proposed to find any power, such as the fourth, of a binomial of which the first term is *A* and the second unity, that is, if we want to find the fourth power of *A*+1, we must take in the arithmetical triangle the fifth base, that is, the base whose exponent 5 is greater by unity than 4, the exponent of the proposed power. The cells of the fifth base are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, of which we must take the first number, 1, as the coefficient of *A* in the proposed power, that is, of *A*^4; next we must take the second number of the base, that is, 4, as the coefficient of *A* in the next lower power, that is, of *A*^3, and take the following number of the base, namely 6, as the coefficient of *A* in the next lower power, that is, of *A*^2, and take the following number of the base, that is 4, as the coefficient of *A* in the next lower power, that is, of *A*, and take the last number of the base, 1, as it is. Thus we shall have 1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1, which will be the fourth power of the binomial *A*+1. So that if *A* (which represents any number) is unity and therefore the binomial *A*+1 is the dyad, the power 1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1 will be

1 * 1^4 + 4 * 1^3 + 6 * 1^2 + 4 * 1 + 1, that is,
once the fourth power of unity (*A*), that is ................. 1
four times the cube of 1, that is ................................. 4
six times the square of 1, that is ................................ 6
four times unity, that is ........................................... 4
plus unity ........................................................... 1
which added together make ..................................... 16

And the fourth power of 2 is in fact 16.

If *A* is another number, such as 4, and consequently the binomial *A*+1 is 5, then its fourth power will still be, in accordance with the above method,

1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1,

which now signifies

1 * 4^4 + 4 * 4^3 + 6 * 4^2 + 4 * 4 + 1,

that is,
once the fourth power of 4, namely ........................... 256
four times the cube of 4 .......................................... 256
six times the square of 4 .......................................... 96
four times the root 4 .............................................. 16
plus unity ........................................................... 1

the sum of which ................................................. 625
is the fourth power of 5, as is indeed the case.

And similarly for all other examples.

If we want to find the same power of the binomial *A*+2, we must again take
1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1,

and then write the four numbers, 2, 4, 8, 16, which are the first four powers of 2, under the numbers 4, 6, 4, 1, that is, under each of the numbers of the base, beginning with the second, as follows:

1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1
2 4 8 16

and multiply the corresponding numbers by each other

1*A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1
2 4 8 16
as follows 1*A*^4+8*A*^3+24*A*^2+32*A*+16

Thus we shall have the fourth power of the binomial *A*+2; so that if *A* is unity, the fourth power will be

once the fourth power of unity (*A*) ........................ 1
eight times the cube of 1 .......................................... 8
24 * 1^2 ............................................................. 24
32 * 1 ................................................................ 32
plus ................................................................. 16
of which the sum ................................................. 81

will be the fourth power of 3, as in fact it is.

And if *A* is 2, then *A*+2 will be 4, and its fourth power will be

once the fourth power of *A*, or 2, namely ................ 16
8 * 2^3 ............................................................... 64
24 * 2^2 ............................................................. 96
32 * 2 ................................................................ 64
plus the fourth power of 2 ...................................... 16
whose sum ........................................................ 256

will be the fourth power of 4.

Similarly we shall find the fourth power of *A*+3,
putting down in the same way *A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1
and underneath, the numbers 3 9 27 81

*A*^4+12*A*^3+54*A*^2+108*A*+81

which are the first 4 powers of 3; multiplying the corresponding numbers, we shall find the fourth power of *A*+3.

And so on to infinity. If instead of the fourth power we want the fifth power, we must take the sixth base and proceed as I have indicated in the case of the fifth, and similarly for all the other powers.

We shall find in the same way the powers of the differences *A*-1, *A*-2, etc. The method is exactly the same except for the signs; the signs + and - succeed each other in alternation, the sign + always coming first.

Thus the fourth power of *A*-1 will be found as follows: the fourth power of *A*+1 is by the preceding rule, *A*^4+4*A*^3+6*A*^2+4*A*+1. Therefore changing the signs as indicated, we shall have *A*^4-4*A*^3+6*A*^2-4*A*+1. Also the cube of *A*-2 will be found in the same way. For the cube of *A*+2 by the preceding rule is *A*^3+6*A*^2+12*A*+8. Therefore the cube of *A*-2 will be found by changing the signs: *A*^3-6*A*^2+12*A*-8. And so on to infinity.

I do not demonstrate these things, because others have already dealt with them, as for example, Herigogne; besides they are evident in themselves.

## TREATISE ON THE ORDERS OF NUMBERS

I assume that the reader has read my *treatise on the arithmetical triangle* and its use for the orders of numbers; if not, I refer to it those who wish to read what follows, which is simply a continuation of it.

I defined what I mean by the orders of numbers there, and I shall not repeat the definition.

I also showed there that the arithmetical triangle is nothing but the table of the orders of numbers; as a result of which it is evident that all the properties given in the arithmetical triangle concerning the relations between cells and between rows have their analogues in the orders of numbers, so that if we possess even a little the art of applying the properties of one to the other, there is no proposition in the *treatise on the triangle* which does not have its consequence for the different orders. And they can be found with such ease and in such abundance that I am far from wishing to write them all out explicitly. I should prefer leaving everything to the reader since it is all so easy. But to avoid both these extremes I shall just give a few examples which will open the way to finding all the others.

For example, from what was said in one of the consequences of the *Treatise on the Triangle*, namely, that each cell is equal to the immediately preceding parallel and perpendicular cells, I derive the following proposition for the orders of numbers:

### Proposition 1

> *A number of any order whatsoever is equal to the number preceding it in its own order together with the number corresponding to it in the preceding order. Consequently the fourth, for example, of the numbers of the fourth order is equal to the third number of the fourth order together with the fourth number of the third order. Also the fifth number of the fifth order is equal to the fourth number of the fifth order together with the fifth number of the fourth order, etc.*

Another example. From its having been shown in the triangle that each cell is equal to the parallel cell preceding it together with all the perpendicular cells preceding this parallel cell, for example, F=E+B+D+A, I derive the following proposition:

### Proposition 2

> *A number of whatsoever order is equal to the sum of the numbers whose root is less than its own by unity of its own and all preceding orders, and consequently the fourth number of the fourth order, for example, is equal to the third number of the fourth order plus the third number of the third order plus the third natural number plus the third number of the units, that is, unity.*

Whence we can now draw other consequences, such as the following, which I give to open the way to other similar ones:

### Proposition 3

> *Every number, whatever its cell, is made up of as many numbers as there are orders from its own to the first, inclusive, each of the numbers representing one of the orders. Thus a number of the fifth order is composed of another number of the fifth order, a number of the fourth order, a number of the third order, a natural number and unity.*

If we want to use this proposition for a problem, we can enunciate it as follows:

### Proposition 4, Problem

> *Given a number of any order, to find a number in each order from the first to its own, inclusive, whose sum is equal to the given number.*

The solution is easy. We must take in all these orders the numbers whose root is less by unity than that of the given number.

Another example. From the fact that reciprocal cells are equal, it follows:

### Proposition 5

> *That two numbers of different orders are equal if the root of one is the same number as the exponent of the other. Consequently the third number of the fourth order is equal to the fourth number of the third order. The fifth number of the eighth order is the same as the eighth number of the fifth order.*

We would never come to an end. For example:

### Proposition 6

> *All the fourth numbers of all the orders are the same as all the numbers of the fourth order, etc.*

Because the parallel and perpendicular rows having the same exponent are composed of equivalent cells.

By this method we shall find a wonderful correspondence in everything else, as, for example, the following:

### Proposition 7

> *A number of whatever order is to the next greater in the same order as the root of the lesser is to itself together with the exponent of the order diminished by unity.*

Which follows from the fourteenth consequence of the *Arithmetical Triangle*, where it is shown that each cell is to the immediately preceding parallel cell as the exponent of the base of the preceding cell is to the exponent of its perpendicular row.

In order that no part of the method by which these correspondences are found remain hidden, I shall make the relationship explicit. It is a little more difficult here than above, because we see no relationship between the base of the *Arithmetical Triangle* and the orders of numbers. This is the way to find it: For the exponent of the base in the fourteenth consequence we must substitute *the exponent of the parallel row together with the exponent of the perpendicular row diminished by unity*. Which gives the same number and with this advantage that we know the relation there is between these exponents and the orders of numbers; for we know that in this new language we must say: *the exponent of the order together with the root diminished by unity*. I say all this that the method of making and facilitating these reductions may be available.

Thus we shall find that:

### Proposition 8

> *A number of whatever order is to the corresponding number of the following order as the exponent of the order of the lesser number is to itself together with the common root diminished by unity.*

This is the thirteenth consequence of the *Arithmetical Triangle*. Thus again we shall find that:

### Proposition 9

> *A number of whatever order is to the number of the preceding order whose root is greater than its own by unity as the root of the first number is to the exponent of the order of the second.*

This is only the twelfth consequence of the *Arithmetical Triangle*.

I omit many other propositions, each of which as well as each of those I have just given can still be greatly increased by different enunciations, for instead of expressing these proportions as I have by saying that *a number is to another as a third is to a fourth*, may we not say that *the rectangle of the extremes is equal to that of the means*, and thus multiply the propositions, and not without utility, for looked at from another side they open up other prospects?

For example, if we wish to express this last proposition in another way, we can enunciate it as follows:

### Proposition 10

> *A number of whatever order when multiplied by the preceding root is equal to the exponent of its order multiplied by the preceding number of the following order.*

And because when four numbers are proportional, the rectangle of the extremes or of the means, when divided by one of the other two gives as quotient the remaining number, we can state the proposition as follows:

### Proposition 11

> *A number of whatever order, when multiplied by the preceding root and divided by the exponent of its order, gives as quotient the preceding number of the following order.*

The ways of saying the same thing are infinite. I cite an illustrious example and one that does me much honor. This very proposition that I have just been turning about in several of its aspects occurred to our celebrated councilor of Toulouse, *M. de Fermat*, and the wonderful thing is that without either of us having given the other any slightest hint of what we were doing, he was writing in his province what I was discovering at Paris, and at the very hour, as our letters written and received at the same time bear witness. Happy to have concurred on this occasion as on others in a really extraordinary way with so great and admirable a man, who in all the investigations of the highest reaches of geometry is at the peak of excellence, as his works, which our long prayers have at last obtained from him, will soon make known to all the geometers of Europe, who are waiting for them! His way of taking the proposition is as follows:

> *In the series of natural numbers beginning with unity the product of any number multiplied by the next higher is double the same number of the third order.*
>
> *The product of any number multiplied by the next higher number of the third order is triple the same number of the fourth order.*
>
> *The product of any number multiplied by the next higher number of the fourth order is quadruple the same number of the fifth order; and so on to infinity by a general and uniform method.*

See how enunciations can be varied! Since what I show for this proposition is to be understood of the rest, I shall not dwell longer on this convenient method but leave it to each to exercise his genius in these investigations which should claim all the study of mathematicians. For if we cannot turn propositions in every direction and if we make use only of the first glimpse we had, we shall never get very far. It is these different roads that open up new consequences and by enunciations suited to the subject bind together propositions which seemed to be unrelated in the terms in which they were originally conceived. I shall then go on with this subject in the usual geometrical way, and what I say will amount to a new treatise on the orders of numbers. I shall even present it in *Latin* because I happen to have written it in that language at the time of discovery.

## CORRESPONDENCE WITH FERMAT ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES

## LETTER FROM FERMAT TO PASCAL

[1654]

Sir,

If I undertake to bring up a given face with a single die in eight throws and if we agree after the money has been staked that I shall not take my first throw, I am entitled by my principle to withdraw from the game 1/6 of the whole sum as compensation for having given up the said first throw.

But if we again agree after that that I shall not take my second throw, I am entitled to withdraw as indemnity 1/6 of what is left, which is 5/36 of the whole.

And if after that we agree that I shall not take my third throw, my indemnity is 1/6 of what is left, which is 25/216 of the whole.

And if after that we again agree that I shall not take my fourth throw, I should withdraw 1/6 of what is left, which is 125/1296 of the whole, and I agree with you that this is the value of the fourth throw on the assumption that I have already been compensated for the preceding throws. But what you ask me to consider in the last example of your letter is (I use your own words): if I undertake to bring up a six in eight throws and have taken three without doing it, if my fellow player asks me to give up my fourth throw but wants to compensate me for losing my chance, 125/1296 of the whole stakes will belong to me.

But this, according to my principle, is not so. For in this case since the player got nothing from his first three throws and the whole stakes are still in the game, if he agrees not to take his fourth throw, he should have as indemnity 1/6 of the whole.

And if he had thrown four times without bringing up the assigned face and it should be agreed he would not take his fifth throw, he should still have as indemnity 1/6 of the whole. For as long as the stakes remain unchanged, it not only follows from principle but it is also common sense that the odds are the same for every throw.

I beg you then to let me know if we are at one on the principle, as I believe we are, and if we differ only in its application.

I am, etc.
Fermat

## LETTER FROM PASCAL TO FERMAT

July 29, 1654

Sir,

I too am overcome by impatience and, although I am still confined to my bed, I can’t resist letting you know that I received yesterday evening from *M. de Carcavi* your letter on divisions (of stakes), which I admire more than I can tell you. I haven’t time to write at length, but in a word your determination of the divisions both for the dice and for the games is perfectly correct; which gives me great satisfaction, for now I can no longer doubt the truth of my results after finding myself in such wonderful agreement with you.

I admire your method for the games much more than for the dice. I had known several persons to discover the method for the dice, such as the *Chevalier de Mere*, who first brought me these questions, and also *M. de Roberval*. But *M. de Mere* had never been able to find the right value of the games nor a way of getting there, so that I found myself alone in the knowledge of this proportion.

Your method is very reliable and is the first that occurred to me in this investigation, but because of the labor involved in using combinations I have found an abridgment of it, or rather a different method much shorter and simpler, which I should like to be able to tell you about here in a few words. For I should like henceforth to open my heart to you if possible, so great is my pleasure in our agreement. I see indeed that truth is the same at Toulouse and at Paris.

This is about the way I find the value of each game when two players are playing, for example, for three games and each has staked 32 *pistoles* on the play:

Let us suppose one player has two games and the other one. They now play a game of which the necessary consequence is that if the first player wins it, he wins all the money at stake, namely, 64 *pistoles*, and if the second player wins it, the score is two to two. Consequently if they wish to separate, each should withdraw his own stake, namely, 32 *pistoles*.

Consider then, Sir, that if the first player wins, 64 *pistoles* belong to him; if he loses, 32. Therefore if they wish not to venture this game and to separate without playing it, the first player should say: "I am sure of having 32 *pistoles*, for even if I lose, I get them. But as for the other 32, perhaps they will be mine, perhaps yours; the odds are even. Let us share these 32 *pistoles* equally therefore, and give me in addition my own 32, which are mine in either case.” He will have 48 *pistoles* then and the second player will have 16.

Let us suppose now that one player has two games and the other player none, and they are beginning a game with the following consequences: if the first player wins it, he takes all the money, 64 *pistoles*; if the second player wins it, they are back at the preceding case, where one player has two games and the other one.

But we have already shown that in this case 48 *pistoles* belong to the player who has two games. Therefore if they wish not to play this game, he should say: "If I win, I shall win the entire sum, which is 64; if I lose, 48 will legitimately be mine. Therefore give me the 48 which are mine even if I lose, and let us share equally the other 16, since you have as much chance of winning them as I have.” Thus he will have 48 and 8, that is, 56 *pistoles*.

Finally let us suppose that one player has only one game and the other none. Clearly, Sir, if they begin a new game, it follows that if the first player wins it, he will have two games to his credit, and consequently by the preceding case 56 *pistoles* will belong to him; if he loses, each has a game, and therefore 32 *pistoles* belong to him. Therefore he should say: ”If you want not to play this game, give me 32 *pistoles*, which are mine in either case, and let us share the rest of the 56 equally. From 56 take 32 and 24 are left; divide 24 in half, you take 12 and I take 12, which with 32 make 44.”

Now in this way you see by simple subtraction that for the first game 12 *pistoles* of the loser’s stake belong to the winner, for the second game another 12, and for the last game 8.

Now, no longer to make a mystery of it, since you see the whole thing perfectly clearly and I was being mysterious about it only to find out if I was not mistaken, the value (I mean value in terms of the loser’s money only) of the last game of two is double that of the last game of three and four times that of the last game of four and eight times that of the last game of five, etc.

But the proportion of the first games is not so easy to find. This then is the way it is, for I don’t want to hide anything, and here is the problem I was making so much of, for indeed I am very much pleased with it:

> *Given any number of games, to find the value of the first.*

Let the given number of games be, for example, 8. Take the first eight even numbers and the first eight odd numbers, namely: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.

Multiply the even numbers as follows: the first by the second, the product by the third, the product by the fourth, the product by the fifth, etc. Multiply the odd numbers in the same way: the first by the second, the product by the third, etc.

The last product of the even numbers is the denominator and the last product of the odd numbers is the numerator of the fraction expressing the value of the first game of eight; that is, if each player stakes the number of *pistoles* expressed by the product of the even numbers, the number of the loser’s *pistoles* belonging to the winner will be expressed by the product of the odd numbers.

Which is demonstrated, but with much labor, by combinations used in the way you thought of; I have not been able to demonstrate it in that other way I was just telling you about, but only by the method of combinations. Here are the preliminary propositions, which are simply arithmetical propositions about combinations, of which I have found some rather nice properties.

If in any number of letters, for example, 8: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, you take all the possible combinations of 4 letters and then all the possible combinations of 5 letters and then of 6, of 7, and of 8, and thus you take all the possible combinations from the number which is half the whole up to the whole, I say that if you add together half the combinations of 4 and all the higher combinations, the sum will be the number of the quaternary progression beginning with the dyad which corresponds to half the number of letters.

For example, and I’ll write it in *Latin*, for *French* is no good here:

> *If in as many letters as you please, for example, 8: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, all combinations of 4, 5, 6, etc., up to 8 are taken, I say that if you add together half the combinations of 4, namely 35 (half 70), all the combinations of 5, namely 56, all the combinations of 6, namely 28, all the combinations of 7, namely 8, and all the combinations of 8, namely 1, you have the fourth number of the quaternary progression beginning with 2: I say fourth number because 4 is half of 8.*

For the numbers of the quaternary progression beginning with 2 are: 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, etc., of which 2 is the first, 8 the second, 32 the third, and 128 the fourth, which 128 is equal to 35, half the combinations of 4 letters, +56, the combinations of 5 letters, +28, the combinations of 6 letters, +8, the combinations of 7 letters, +1, the combination of 8 letters.

This is the first proposition, which is purely arithmetical; the second is concerned with the doctrine of divisions and is as follows:

First it must be stated that if one game out of 5 has been won, for example, and therefore 4 are lacking, the set will have to be decided in 8 games, which is double 4.

The value of the first game of 5 in terms of the loser’s money is the fraction which has as numerator half the combinations of 4 in 8 (I take 4 because it is equal to the number of games lacking and 8 because it is double 4) and as denominator the numerator together with all the higher combinations.

Thus if I have one game out of 5, 35/128 of my fellow player’s money belongs to me; that is, if he has staked 128 *pistoles*, I take 35 and leave him the rest, 93.

But the fraction 35/128 is the same as 35/128, of which the denominator is the product of the even numbers and the numerator is the product of the odd numbers.

You will undoubtedly see all this very well if you take the trouble to consider it at all. That is why I think there is no use saying anything more about it. However, I am sending you one of my old tables (p. 479); I haven’t time to copy it. I shall make another one. You will see there as always that the value of the first game is the same as that of the second, which is easily found by combinations.

You will also see that the numbers of the first line always increase; similarly those of the second line and those of the third line.

But afterwards those of the fourth line decrease, those of the fifth, etc., which is strange.

I haven’t time to send you the demonstration of a difficulty which caused M . . . great astonishment, for he is very intelligent, but he is not a geometer (which is, as you know, a great defect); he does not even understand how a mathematical line can be infinitely divisible and thinks he knows very well that it is composed of a finite number of points. I have never been able to get that out of his head; if you could do it, we would make him perfect.

He told me then that he had found something wrong with numbers for the following reason:

If we undertake to throw a six with one die, the odds for succeeding in 4 throws are as 671 to 625.

If we undertake to throw a double six with two dice, the odds are against success in 24 throws.

And yet 24 is to 36 (which is the number of faces of the two dice) as 4 is to 6 (which is the number of faces of one die).

This was so great a scandal to him that he openly proclaimed propositions were doubtful and arithmetic self-contradictory. But with your principles you will easily see the explanation.

I shall put down in order everything I have done with this when I have completed the geometrical treatises on which I have been working for some time now.

I have also written some arithmetical treatises, in connection with which I beg you to send me your opinion on the following demonstration.

I assume the well-known lemma that twice the sum of as many numbers as we please of the continuous progression beginning with unity, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, is equal to the last, 4, multiplied by the next greater, 5, that is, that twice the sum of the numbers contained in A is equal to the product of A and (A+1).

Now I come to my proposition:

> *The difference of any two successive cubes exceeds by unity six times all the numbers contained in the root of the smaller cube.*

Let there be two roots, R, S, differing by unity:

I say R^3 - S^3 - 1 is equal to six times the sum of the numbers contained in S.
For let S be called A; therefore R is A + 1.
Therefore the cube of root R, or A + 1, is A^3 + 3A^2 + 3A + 1.
But the cube of S, or A, is A^3;
and their difference is 3A^2 + 3A + 1, that is R^3 - S^3;
therefore if we subtract unity, 3A^2 + 3A = R^3 - S^3 - 1.
But twice the sum of the numbers contained in A or S is equal by the lemma to A(A + 1), that is, A^2 + A;
therefore six times the sum of the numbers contained in A is equal to 3A^2 + 3A.
But 3A^2 + 3A = R^3 - S^3 - 1; therefore
R^3 - S^3 - 1 is equal to six times the sum of the numbers contained in A or S.

Q.E.D.

No one has objected to my demonstration, but I have been told that no objection was made because everyone now is used to this method. But I claim that without any favor to me this demonstration should be accepted as excellent in kind. However I await your opinion with full submission.

All my arithmetical demonstrations are of this kind. Here are two more difficulties.

I have demonstrated a proposition in plane geometry by making use of the cube of a line compared to the cube of another line. I claim that this is purely geometrical and in accordance with the strictest standards.

Also I have solved the problem:

> *Of four planes, four points, and four spheres, any four (of the twelve) being given, to find a sphere which, touching the given spheres, passes through the given points and leaves on the planes parts of spheres in which given angles can be inscribed, and this problem:*
>
> *Of three circles, three points, and three lines, any three (of the nine) being given, to find a circle which, touching the circles and the points, leaves on the lines an arc in which a given angle can be inscribed.*

I found a complete solution for these problems, using in the construction only circles and straight lines; but in the demonstration I make use of conic sections, of parabolas or hyperbolas. However I claim that since the construction is plane, my solution is plane and should be accepted as such.

It is a poor return for the honor you do me in suffering my letters, to take up so much of your time. I never think I am going to write more than a word or two, and so I don’t tell you what I have most at heart, which is that the more I know you, the more I admire and honor you, and that if you knew my feelings in this respect, you would give a place in your friendship to him who is, etc.

## LETTER FROM PASCAL TO FERMAT

August 24, 1654

Sir,

I was not able to put before you in their entirety my views on the subject of divisions among several players by the last mail; I am even somewhat reluctant to do so for fear that that wonderful agreement between us which was so dear to me may begin to fail here, for I am afraid that we have different opinions on this subject. I want to put my whole argument before you, and you will do me the favor of correcting me if I am in error, or of supporting me if I have struck it right. I really ask this in all sincerity for I shall only feel sure of my view when you are on my side.

When there are only two players, your method, which uses combinations, is very reliable; but when there are three players, I think I have proof that it is not accurate, unless you go about it in some other way I do not understand. But the method I explained to you and which I use everywhere is applicable to all imaginable conditions of every kind of division, whereas the method of combinations (which I use only in certain cases where it is shorter than the general method) is good only for those occasions and not for all.

I am sure I shall succeed in making myself understood, but it will take a few words on my part and a little patience on yours.

This is your procedure when there are two players:

If the situation of two players playing for several games is such that the first player lacks two games and the second player three, to find the division we must (you say) see in how many games the play will have to be decided.

It is easy to reckon that it will be in four games, whence you conclude we must see how many combinations there are of four games between two players and see in how many combinations the first player would win and in how many the second, and divide the money in that ratio. I should have had difficulty in following that statement if I hadn’t already known what it meant by my own work; and of course you had written it with that in mind. To see how many times four games combine between two players then, we must imagine that they play with a die having two faces (since they are only two), as in heads and tails, and that they throw four of these dice (because they are playing four games); and now we must see in how many different ways these dice can fall. That is easily reckoned: they can fall in sixteen ways, since sixteen is the second power of four, that is the square. For let us imagine one of the faces marked with an *a*, favorable to the first player, and the other with a *b*, favorable to the second player; therefore the four dice can fall in any one of the sixteen ways indicated: aaaa ... bbbb.

aaaa
aaab
aaba
aabb
abaa
abab
abba
abbb
baaa
baab
baba
babb
bbaa
bbab
bbba
bbbb

And because the first player lacks two games, all the casts with two *a*s give him the set; therefore there are 11 for him. And because the second player lacks three games, all the casts with three *b*s can give him the set; therefore there are 5. Therefore they must share the sum in the ratio of 11 to 5.

This is your method when there are two players. Whereupon you say that if there are more, it will not be difficult to determine the divisions by the same method.

Here, dear Sir, I must tell you that this division for two players, based on combinations, is perfectly accurate and satisfactory, but that if there are more than two players, it will not always be accurate; and I shall tell you the reason for this difference.

I communicated your method to our friends, whereupon M. de Roberval raised the following objection:

> That it is an error to base the method of determining the division on the supposition that four games would be played, since when one player lacks two games and the other player three, it is not necessarily true that four games would be played, but it is possible that only two or three would be played or to be sure perhaps four;

> And that he did not see therefore why it should be claimed that the just division would be made on the fictitious condition that four games would be played, since the natural condition of play is that the players stop as soon as one of them has won, and that at least if this division was not erroneous, it had not been demonstrated, so that he had some suspicion we were guilty of a paralogism.

I replied that I did not rely so much on the method of combinations, which is really not in its proper place here, as on my other universal method, which deals with all cases and carries its demonstration with it, and which gives exactly the same division as the method of combinations. Moreover I demonstrated for him the correctness of the division between two players by combinations as follows:

Isn’t it true that if two players of whom one lacks two games and the other three, in accordance with the hypothesis, now freely agree to play four games, that is, to throw the four dice with two faces all at once, isn’t it true, I say, that if they decided to play the four games, the division should be as we said, in accordance with the number of casts favorable to each?

He agreed, and indeed this can be demonstrated; but he denied the case was the same when there was no commitment to play the four games. Thereupon I spoke as follows:

Isn’t it evident that the same players, not committed to playing the four games but wishing to stop as soon as one should have reached his number, can without advantage or disadvantage commit themselves to playing all four games, and that this agreement does not change their situation in any respect? For if the first player wins the first two games of the four and therefore has won the set, will he refuse to play two more games in view of the fact that if he wins them, he has not won better, and if he loses them, he has not won less, for these two games that the second player has won are not enough for him since he lacks three, and thus four games are not enough to make it possible for both of them to get the number they lack?

Certainly it is easy to see that it is a matter of perfect indifference to both whether they play on the condition natural to their game, which is to stop as soon as one has his number, or whether they play all four games. Therefore since there is nothing to choose between these two conditions, the division should be exactly the same in both. But it is just when they have to play four games, as I have shown; therefore it is just in the other case as well.

That is how I demonstrated it, and you will notice that the demonstration is based on the equality of the two conditions, actual and fictitious, with respect to two players, and on the fact that the same player will always win in both, and if one player wins or loses in one case, he will win or lose in the other and two will never have the required number of games.

Let us now consider three players in the same way and suppose that the first player lacks one game, the second and third each two. To determine the division, following the same method of combinations, we must first find out how many games will decide the play, as we did when there were two players. It will be three, for they could not play three games without there being necessarily a decision.

We must now see how many combinations there are of 3 games among three players and how many are favorable to the first, second, and third player, respectively, and in accordance with this proportion distribute the money just as before on the hypothesis of two players.

As for seeing how many combinations there are in all, that is easy: it is the third power of 3, that is, its cube, 27. For if we throw three dice together (since three games must be played) each of which has three faces (since there are three players), one marked with an *a*, favorable to the first player, another with a *b* for the second player, and the other with a *c* for the third player, it is obvious that these three dice thrown together can fall in 27 different ways, namely:

aaa
aab
aac
aba
abb
abc
aca
acb
acc
baa
bab
bac
bba
bbb
bbc
bca
bcb
bcc
caa
cab
cac
cba
cbb
cbc
cca
ccb
ccc

But the first player lacks only one game; therefore all the casts with an *a* are for him; therefore he has 19.

The second player lacks two games; therefore all the casts with two *b*s are for him; therefore he has 7.

The third player lacks two games; therefore all the casts with two *c*s are for him; therefore he has 7.

If we then concluded that the shares of the players should be proportional to 19, 7, 7, our error would be too gross, and I am far from thinking you capable of it. For some casts are favorable to the first and to the second at the same time, such as *abb*, for the first player finds the *a* he needs there and the second player the two *b*s he needs; similarly *acc* is for both the first and the third.

Therefore we must not count those casts favorable to two players as worth the whole sum to each, but only half the sum. For if *acc* were thrown, the first and the third would have equal rights to the sum, each having the required number of games; therefore they would share the money equally. But if *aab* is thrown, the first alone wins. The reckoning should therefore be made as follows:

There are 13 throws which give the entire sum to the first player, 6 which give him half and 8 which give him nothing. Therefore if the whole sum is a pistole, there are 13 casts which are each worth a pistole to him, 6 which are each worth half a pistole, and 8 worth nothing.

Therefore in case of division we must multiply
13 by one pistole, which makes... 13
6 by half a pistole, which makes... 3
8 by 0, which makes... 0
Sum 27 Sum 16

and divide the sum of the values, 16, by the sum of the casts, 27, which gives the fraction 16/27, which is what belongs to the first player in case of division, namely 16 pistoles out of 27.

The divisions of the second and third players will be found in the same way:

There are 4 casts worth 1 pistole:
multiply... 4
There are 3 casts worth half a pistole:
multiply... 1½
And 20 casts worth nothing... 0
Sum 27 Sum 5½

Therefore 5½ pistoles out of 27 belong to the second player, and as many to the third player, and these three sums, 5½, 5½, and 16, added together, make the 27.

This, it seems to me, is the way divisions should be determined by combinations in accordance with your method unless you have a different method here which I must not know. But unless I am mistaken, this is not the right division.

The reason is that a false supposition is made, namely, that three games are necessarily played, whereas the natural condition of that play is that no more games are played as soon as one of the players has reached the required number.

Not that it can’t happen that 3 games are played; but it can also happen that only one or two are played. There is nothing necessary about it.

But how is it, someone will ask, that it is not permissible in this case to make the same fictitious supposition as in the case of two players? The reason is:

In the actual condition of these three players there is only one who can win, for the condition is that as soon as one wins, the play stops. But in the fictitious condition two players can both reach the required number of games: namely, if the first player wins the one he lacks and one of the others the two he lacks; for they will have played only three games. Whereas when there were only two players, the fictitious and the actual conditions were the same in all respects so far as the odds of the players were concerned; and that is what makes so great a difference between the two conditions.

But if the players in the situation supposed (that is, one player lacking one game and the other two players each lacking two games) now freely agree to the condition that they will play all three games and that if anyone is alone in winning the required number of games, he will take the entire sum, and that if two win the required number, they will share the stakes equally, in this case the division should be as I just said: the first should have 16, the second 5½, the third 5½, out of the 27 pistoles, and that requires no demonstration if we suppose the condition to be as stated.

But if they play simply on condition not that three games will necessarily be played but that only as many will be played as are needed to give one of them the required number and that then the play stop without giving one of the others a chance to get the required number too, then 17 pistoles of the 27 belong to the first player and 5 to the second and to the third, each.

This is shown by my general method, which also determines that in the preceding situation the first player should have 16, the second and the third 5½ each, without the use of combinations, for this method is universal and always possible.

There you have, Sir, my thoughts on this subject, in which the only advantage I have over you is that I have reflected much more about it. But that is a small matter where you are concerned, since your first insights go deeper than my long efforts.

The reason I expound my views to you is to get a judgment from you on them. I think I must have convinced you that the method of combinations is good for two players accidentally, as it is also sometimes for three players, as when two each lack one game and the other player lacks two, because in this case the number of games in which the set must be completed does not permit its being won by two players. But the method is not general and is generally good only for the case in which the players are committed to a fixed number of games regardless of the score.

So that, since you did not know my method when you set me the problem of dividing the stakes among several players, but only the method of combinations, I am afraid we may have different opinions on this matter.

I beg you to let me know how you go about finding this division. I shall receive your answer with respect and joy, even if your opinion is at variance with mine. I am, etc.

## LETTER FROM FERMAT TO PASCAL

Toulouse, August 29, 1654

Sir,

Our double thrusts still keep up, and like you I am struck with admiration that our ideas fit so perfectly it seems as if they have taken the same road and covered the same distance. Your recent treatises on the arithmetical triangle and its application are a real proof of it, and if my calculation is right, your twelfth consequence was being carried with the mail from Paris to Toulouse while my proposition on figural numbers, which is actually the same, was on its way from Toulouse to Paris.

I am not afraid of going astray as long as I fall in with you in this way, and I am convinced that the true method of avoiding error is to find oneself in agreement with you. But if I said more, it would smack of compliment, and we have banished that enemy of easy and agreeable conversations.

It is my turn now to tell you some of my discoveries in arithmetic, but I am so busy with the end of Parliament that I venture to hope you will be kind enough to grant me a deserved and as it were necessary respite.

Nevertheless I shall answer your question about the three players who are playing for two games. When the first player has a game and the others do not, your first solution is right, and the shares of the stakes should be to each other as 17, 5, and 5; the reason for which is obvious and comes as always from the same principle, it being clear at once by combinations that 17 of the 27 equal chances are for the first player and only 5 for each of the other two.

As for the rest, there is nothing that I shall not communicate to you in the future in all sincerity. Consider meanwhile, if you find it convenient, the following proposition:

The squares of the powers of 2, increased by unity, are always primes.

The square of 2, increased by unity, is 5, which is a prime.

The square of the square, 16, increased by unity, is 17, a prime.

The square of 16 is 256 which, increased by unity, is 257, a prime.

The square of 256 is 65,536 which, increased by unity, is 65,537, a prime. And so on to infinity.

I will answer to you for the truth of this property, but it is not easy to prove, and I confess that I have not yet been able to find a complete demonstration. I wouldn’t ask you to work at it if I had been successful.

With this proposition we can find numbers which are in a given ratio to their aliquot parts, in connection with which I have made some important discoveries. We shall speak of them another time.

I am, etc.

## LETTER FROM FERMAT TO PASCAL

[September 25, 1654]

Sir,

Do not be afraid that our concordance is at an end. You have yourself confirmed it while thinking to destroy it, and it seems to me that in answering M. de Roberval for yourself you have also answered for me.

I take the example of the three players, of whom the first lacks one game and each of the other two lacks two games, which is the case you urge against me. I find only 17 combinations there for the first player and 5 for each of the others; for when you say that the combination *acc* is favorable to the first player and to the third player, it seems that you are no longer remembering that everything which happens after one of the players has won is of no use. Since this combination has given the set to the first player with the first game, what difference does it make that the third player wins two games afterwards when, if he won thirty, they would all be superfluous?

Which is due to the fact that, as you very well observed, this fiction of extending the play to a certain number of games serves only to facilitate the rule and (in my opinion) to make all the chances equal or, more intelligibly, to reduce all the fractions to a common denominator.

And to remove all possible doubt, if in the case before us you extend the fiction to four games instead of three, there will be not merely 27 combinations but 81, and we must see how many combinations will give the first player one game before either one of the other two players has two games and how many will give each of the others two games before the first player has one. You will find that the combinations favorable to the first player will be 51 and those favorable to each of the other two 15, which comes to the same ratio.

And if you take five games or any other number you please, you always find 3 numbers proportional to 17, 5, 5.

And so I have a right to say that the combination *acc* is only for the first player and not for the third, and that *cca* is only for the third player and not for the first, and that consequently my rule of combinations is the same for three players as for two, and generally for every number.

You could already see by my preceding letter that I did not hesitate over the true solution of the question of three players, for which I sent you the three decisive numbers, 17, 5, 5. But since M. de Roberval will perhaps be very glad to see a solution that makes no use of fiction, and since it can sometimes shorten the labor in many cases, here it is in the example before us:

The first player can win either in a single game or in two or in three.

If he wins in a single game, he must bring up on the first throw the favorable face of a die having three faces. A single die gives 3 chances. This player then has 1/3 of the chances if only one game is played.

If two games are played, he can win in two ways, either when the second player wins the first game and he wins the second, or when the third player wins the first game and he the second. But two dice give 9 chances. This player then has 2/9 of the chances when two games are played.

If three games are played he can win in only two ways, either when the second player wins the first game, the third player the second game, and he the third, or when the third player wins the first game, the second the second, and he the third; for if either the second player or the third player won the first two games, he and not the first player would win the set. But three dice give 27 chances. Therefore the first player has 2/27 of the chances when three games are played.

The sum of the chances which give the set to the first player is consequently 1/3 + 2/9 + 2/27, which makes 17/27 in all.

The rule works and is general for all cases, so that without recourse to fiction the actual combinations in each number of games give a solution and make clear what I said at the start, that extension to a given number of games is nothing but the reduction of different fractions to a common denominator. There you have in a few words the whole mystery, which will undoubtedly restore our good understanding, since neither of us is looking for anything but reason and truth.

I hope to send you at Martinmas a summary of everything considerable I have discovered about numbers. You will excuse me for being concise and speaking to be understood only by a man who gets everything at a word.

The most important thing you will find there concerns the proposition that every number is composed of one, two, or three triangles, of one, two, three, or four squares, of one, two, three, four, or five pentagons, of one, two, three, four, five, or six hexagons, and so on to infinity.

Before it can be demonstrated, we must first demonstrate that every prime number which exceeds by unity a multiple of four is composed of two squares, such as 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, etc.

Given a prime number of this kind, such as 53, to find by a general rule the two squares composing it.

Every prime number which exceeds by unity a multiple of 3 is composed of a square and the triple of another square, such as 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, etc.

Every prime number which exceeds by 1 or by 3 a multiple of 8 is composed of a square and the double of another square, such as 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, etc.

There is no triangular number whose area is equal to a square number.

This will be followed by the discovery of many propositions which Bachet confesses not to have known and which are not found in *Diophantus*.

I am convinced that as soon as you are familiar with my method of demonstrating this kind of proposition, you will be delighted with it and will find it the means of making many new discoveries, for it is necessary, as you know, *multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia*¹.

If I have time, we shall then talk about magic numbers and I shall recall my old cases on this subject.

I am with all my heart, Sir, your, etc.

¹Many should go over the ground that science be increased.

I desire the health of M. de Carcavi as my own, and I am all his.

I am writing to you from the country, a circumstance which may delay my answers during the vacation.

## LETTER FROM PASCAL TO FERMAT

[October 27, 1654]

Sir,

Your last letter has given me perfect satisfaction. I admire your method of making divisions, the more so that I understand it very well. It is wholly yours, has nothing in common with mine, and easily arrives at the same end. Our good understanding is restored.

But, my dear Sir, if I have concurred with you in this, look elsewhere for someone to follow you in your discoveries in arithmetic, the enunciations of which you have been kind enough to send me. For my own part, I confess they go much beyond me. I am only capable of admiring them, and I humbly beg you to devote your first leisure to their completion. All our friends saw them last Saturday and gave them their wholehearted esteem. It is not easy to have to wait for things so beautiful and so much to be wished for. Please therefore give your attention to them and be assured that I am, etc.

Pascal
