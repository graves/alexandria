*Before the temple of Thetis in Thessaly. Enter ANDROMACHE.*

**Andromache.**
O city of *Thebes*[^1], glory of *Asia*, whence on a day I came to *Priam's* princely home with many a rich and costly thing in my dower, affianced unto *Hector* to be the mother of his children, I, *Andromache*, envied name in days of yore, but now of all women that have been or yet shall be the most unfortunate; for I have lived to see my husband *Hector* slain by *Achilles*, and the babe *Astyanax*, whom I bore my lord, hurled from the towering battlements, when the *Hellenes* sacked our *Trojan* home; and I myself am come to *Hellas* as a slave, though I was esteemed a daughter of a race most free, given to *Neoptolemus*, that island-prince, and set apart for him as his special prize from the spoils of *Troy*. And here I dwell upon the boundaries of *Phthia* and *Pharsalia's* town, where *Thetis* erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with *Peleus* apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of *Thessaly* call it the sacred place of *Thetis*, in honour of the goddess's marriage. Here dwells the son of *Achilles* and suffers *Peleus* still to rule *Pharsalia*, not wishing to assume the sceptre while the old man lives. Within these halls have I borne a boy to the son of *Achilles*, my master. Now aforetime for all my misery I ever had a hope to lead me on, that, if my child were safe, I might find some help and protection from my woes; but since my lord in scorn of his bondmaid's charms hath wedded that *Spartan Hermione*, I am tormented by her most cruelly; for she saith that I by secret enchantment am making her barren and distasteful to her husband, and that I design to take her place in this house, ousting her, the rightful mistress, by force; whereas I at first submitted against my will and now have resigned my place; be almighty *Zeus* my witness that it was not of my own free will I became her rival!

But I cannot convince her, and she longs to kill me, and her father *Menelaus* is an accomplice in this. E'en now is he within, arrived from *Sparta* for this very purpose, while I in terror am come to take up a position here in the shrine of *Thetis* adjoining the house, if haply it may save me from death; for *Peleus* and his descendants hold it in honour as a symbol of his marriage with the *Nereid*. My only son am I secretly conveying to a neighbour's house in fear for his life. For his sire stands not by my side to lend his aid and cannot avail his child at all, being absent in the land of *Delphi*, where he is offering recompense to *Loxias* for the madness he committed, when on a day he went to *Pytho* and demanded of *Phoebus* satisfaction for his father's death, if haply his prayer might avert those past sins and win for him the god's good will hereafter.

*Enter Maid.*

**Maid.**
Mistress mine, be sure I do not hesitate to call thee by that name, seeing that I thought it thy right in thine own house also, when we dwelt in *Troy-land*; as I was ever thy friend and thy husband's while yet he was alive, so now have I come with strange tidings, in terror lest any of our masters learn hereof but still out of pity for thee; for *Menelaus* and his daughter are forming dire plots against thee, whereof thou must beware.

**Andromache.**
Ah! kind companion of my bondage, for such thou art to her, who, erst thy queen, is now sunk in misery; what are they doing? What new schemes are they devising in their eagerness to take away my wretched life?

**Maid.**
Alas! poor lady, they intend to slay thy son, whom thou hast privily conveyed from out the house.

**Andromache.**
Ah me! Has she[^2] heard that my babe was put out of her reach? Who told her? Woe is me! how utterly undone!

**Maid.**
I know not, but thus much of their schemes I heard myself; and *Menelaus* has left the house to fetch him.

**Andromache.**
Then am I lost; ah, my child! those vultures twain will take and slay thee; while he who is called thy father lingers still in *Delphi*.

**Maid.**
True, for had he been here thou wouldst not have fared so hardly, I am sure; but, as it is, thou art friendless.

**Andromache.**
Have no tidings come of the possible arrival of *Peleus*?

**Maid.**
He is too old to help thee if he came.

**Andromache.**
And yet I sent for him more than once.

**Maid.**
Surely thou dost not suppose that any of thy messengers heed thee?

**Andromache.**
Why should they? Wilt thou then go for me?

**Maid.**
How shall I explain my long absence from the house?

**Andromache.**
Thou art a woman; thou canst invent a hundred ways.

**Maid.**
There is a risk, for *Hermione* keeps no careless guard.

**Andromache.**
Dost look to that? Thou art disowning thy friends in distress.

**Maid.**
Not so; never taunt me with that. I will go, for of a truth a woman and a slave is not of much account, e'en if aught befall me.

**Andromache.**
Go then, while I will tell to heaven the lengthy tale of lamentation, mourning, and weeping, that has ever been my hard lot; (*Exit Maid.*) for 'tis woman's way to delight in present misfortunes even to keeping them always on her tongue and lips. But I have many reasons, not merely one for tears—my city's fall, my *Hector's* death, the hardness of the lot to which I am bound, since I fell on slavery's evil days undeservedly. 'Tis never right to call a son of man happy, till thou hast seen his end, to judge from the way he passes it how he will descend to that other world.

'Twas no bride *Paris* took with him
to the towers of *Ilium*,
but a curse to his bed when he brought *Helen* to her bower.
For her sake, O *Troy*, did eager warriors,
sailing from *Hellas* in a thousand ships,
capture and make thee a prey to fire and sword;
and the son of sea-born *Thetis* mounted on his chariot
dragged my husband *Hector* round the walls,
ah woe is me! while I was hurried from my chamber to the beach,
with slavery's hateful pall upon me.
And many a tear I shed as I left my city,
my bridal bower, and my husband in the dust.
Woe, woe is me! why should I prolong my life,
to serve *Hermione*?
Her cruelty it is that drives me hither
to the image of the goddess to throw my suppliant arms about it,
melting to tears as doth a spring that gushes from the rock.

*Enter Chorus of Phthian Women.*

**Chorus.**
    Lady, thus keeping thy weary station without pause
    upon the floor of *Thetis'* shrine,
    *Phthian* though I am, to thee, a daughter of *Asia*, I come,
    to see if I can devise some remedy for these perplexing troubles,
    which have involved thee and *Hermione* in fell discord,
    because to thy sorrow thou sharest with her the love of *Achilles'* son.
    Recognize thy position, weigh the present evil into which thou art come.
    Thou art a *Trojan* captive; thy rival is thy mistress,
    a true-born daughter of *Sparta*.
    Leave then this home of sacrifice, the shrine of our sea-goddess.
    How can it avail thee to waste thy comeliness
    and disfigure it by weeping by reason of a mistress's harsh usage?
    Might will prevail against thee; why vainly toil in thy feebleness?
    Come, quit the bright sanctuary of the *Nereid* divine.
    Recognize that thou art in bondage on a foreign soil,
    in a strange city, where thou seest none of all thy friends,
    luckless lady, cast on evil days.
    Yea, I did pity thee most truly, *Trojan* dame,
    when thou camest to this house;
    but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace,
    albeit I sympathize with thee,
    lest she, whom *Zeus'* daughter bore, discover my good will toward thee.

*Enter HERMIONE.*

**Hermione.**
With a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from the palace of *Achilles* or *Peleus*, but gifts my father *Menelaus* gave me together with a sumptuous dower from *Sparta* in *Laconia*, to insure me freedom of speech. Such is my answer to you; but as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; for *Asia's* daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the *Nereid* avail thee aught, no! neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no *Hector*, no *Priam* with his gold, but a city of *Hellas*. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man that slew thy husband, and bear children to the murderer. Such is all the race of barbarians; father and daughter, mother and son, sister and brother mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each other's blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of two wives, and men are content to turn their attention to one lawful love, that is, all who care to live an honourable life.

**Chorus.**
    Women are by nature somewhat jealous,
    and do ever show the keenest hate to rivals in their love.

**Andromache.**
Ah! well-a-day! Youth is a bane to mortals, in every case, that is, where a man embraces injustice in his early days. Now I am afraid that my being a slave will prevent thee listening to me in spite of many a just plea, or if I win my case, I fear I may be damaged on this very ground, for the high and mighty cannot brook refuting arguments from their inferiors; still I will not be convicted of betraying my own cause. Tell me, proud young wife, what assurance can make me confident of wresting from thee thy lawful lord? Is it that *Laconia's* capital yields to *Phrygia*? Is it that my fortune outstrips thine? Or that in me thou seest a free woman? Am I so elated by my youth, my full healthy figure, the extent of my city, the number of my friends that I wish to supplant thee in thy home? Is my purpose to take thy place and rear myself a race of slaves, mere appendages to my misery? Or, supposing thou bear no children, will any one endure that sons of mine should rule o'er *Phthia*? Ah no! there is the love that *Hellas* bears me, both for *Hector's* sake and for my own humble rank forsooth, that never knew a queen's estate in *Troy*. 'Tis not my sorcery that makes thy husband hate thee, nay, but thy own failure to prove thyself his help-meet. Herein lies love's only charm; 'tis not beauty, lady, but virtuous acts that win our husbands' hearts. And though it gall thee to be told so, albeit thy city in *Laconia* is no doubt a mighty fact, yet thou findest no place for his *Scyros*, displaying wealth 'midst poverty and setting *Menelaus* above *Achilles*: and that is what alienates thy lord. Take heed; for a woman, though bestowed upon a worthless husband, must be with him content, and ne'er advance presumptuous claims. Suppose thou hadst wedded a prince of *Thrace*, the land of flood and melting snow, where one lord shares his affections with a host of wives, wouldst thou have slain them? If so, thou wouldst have set a stigma of insatiate lust on all our sex. A shameful charge! And yet herein we suffer more than men, though we make a good stand against it. Ah! my dear lord *Hector*, for thy sake would I e'en brook a rival, if ever *Cypris* led thee astray, and oft in days gone by I held thy bastard babes to my own breast, to spare thee any cause for grief. By this course I bound my husband to me by virtue's chains, whereas thou wilt never so much as let the drops of dew from heaven above settle on thy lord, in thy jealous fear. Oh! seek not to surpass thy mother in hankering after men, for 'tis well that all wise children should avoid the habits of such evil mothers.

**Chorus.**
    Mistress mine, be persuaded to come to terms with her,
    as far as readily comes within thy power.

**Hermione.**
Why this haughty tone, this bandying of words, as if, forsooth, thou, not I, wert the virtuous wife?

**Andromache.**
Thy present claims at any rate give thee small title thereto.

**Hermione.**
Woman, may my bosom never harbour such ideas as thine!

**Andromache.**
Thou art young to speak on so delicate a subject.

**Hermione.**
As for thee, thou dost not speak thereof, but, as thou canst, dost put it into action against me.

**Andromache.**
Canst thou not conceal thy pangs of jealousy?

**Hermione.**
What! doth not every woman put this first of all?

**Andromache.**
Yes, if her experiences are happy; otherwise, there is no honour in speaking of them.

**Hermione.**
Barbarians' laws are not a standard for our city.

**Andromache.**
Alike in *Asia* and in *Hellas* infamy attends base actions.

**Hermione.**
Clever, clever quibbler! yet die thou must and shalt.

**Andromache.**
Dost see the image of *Thetis* with her eye upon thee?

**Hermione.**
A bitter foe to thy country because of the death of *Achilles*.

**Andromache.**
'Twas not I that slew him, but *Helen*, that mother of thine.

**Hermione.**
Pray, is it thy intention to probe my wounds yet deeper?

**Andromache.**
Behold, I am dumb, my lips are closed.

**Hermione.**
Tell me that which was my only reason for coming hither.

**Andromache.**
No! all I tell thee is, thou hast less wisdom than thou needest.

**Hermione.**
Wilt thou leave these hallowed precincts of the sea-goddess?

**Andromache.**
Yes, if I am not to die for it; otherwise, I never will.

**Hermione.**
Since that is thy resolve, I shall not even wait my lord's return.

**Andromache.**
Nor yet will I, at any rate ere that, surrender to thee.

**Hermione.**
I will bring fire to bear on thee, and pay no heed to thy entreaties.

**Andromache.**
Kindle thy blaze then; the gods will witness it.

**Hermione.**
And make thy flesh to writhe by cruel wounds.

**Andromache.**
Begin thy butchery, stain the altar of the goddess with blood, for she will visit thy iniquity.

**Hermione.**
Barbarian creature, hardened in impudence, wilt thou brave death itself? Still will I find speedy means to make thee quit this seat of thy free-will; such a bait have I to lure thee with. But I will hide my meaning, which the event itself shall soon declare. Yes, keep thy seat, for I will make thee rise, though molten lead is holding thee there, before *Achilles'* son, thy trusted champion, arrive.

*Exit HERMIONE.*

**Andromache.**
My trusted champion, yes! how strange it is, that, though some god hath devised cures for mortals against the venom of reptiles, no man ever yet hath discovered aught to cure a woman's venom, which is far worse than viper's sting or scorching flame; so terrible a curse are we to mankind.

**Chorus.**
    Ah! what sorrows did the son of *Zeus* and *Maia* herald,
    in the day he came to *Ida's* glen,
    guiding that fair young trio of goddesses,
    all girded for the fray in bitter rivalry about their beauty,
    to the shepherd's fold, where dwelt the youthful herdsman
    all alone by the hearth of his lonely hut.
    Soon as they reached the wooded glen,
    in gushing mountain springs they bathed their dazzling skin,
    then sought the son of *Priam*,
    comparing their rival charms in more than rancorous phrase.
    But *Cypris* won the day by her deceitful promises,
    sweet-sounding words, but fraught with ruthless overthrow
    to *Phrygia's* hapless town and *Ilium's* towers.
    Would God his mother had smitten him a cruel death-blow on the head
    before he made his home on *Ida's* slopes,
    in the hour *Cassandra*, standing by the holy bay-tree, cried out,
    > "Slay him, for he will bring most grievous bane on *Priam's* town."
    To every prince she went, to every elder sued for the babe's destruction.
    Ah! had they listened, *Ilium's* daughters ne'er had felt the yoke of slavery,
    and thou, lady, hadst been established in the royal palace;
    and *Hellas* had been freed of all the anguish she suffered
    during those ten long years her sons went wandering,
    spear in hand, around the walls of *Troy*;
    brides had never been left desolate, nor hoary fathers childless.

*Enter MENELAUS, with MOLOSSUS.*

**Menelaus.**
Behold I bring thy son with me, whom thou didst steal away to a neighbour's house without my daughter's knowledge. Thou wert so sure this image of the goddess would protect thee and those who hid him, but thou hast not proved clever enough for *Menelaus*. And so if thou refuse to leave thy station here, he shall be slain instead of thee. Wherefore weigh it well: wilt die thyself, or see him slain for the sin whereof thou art guilty against me and my daughter?

**Andromache.**
O fame, fame! full many a man ere now of no account hast thou to high estate exalted. Those, indeed, who truly have a fair repute, I count blest; but those who get it by false pretences, I will never allow have aught but the accidental appearance of wisdom. Thou for instance, caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest *Troy* from *Priam* with thy picked troops of *Hellenes*? Thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; unworthy I count thee of *Troy's* capture, and *Troy* still more disgraced by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward show, but inwardly resemble the common herd save it be in wealth, which is their chiefest strength.

Come now, *Menelaus*, let us discuss this argument. Suppose I am slain by thy daughter, and she work her will on me, yet can she never escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? *Troy* has no such coward's tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty's call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of *Peleus* and *Achilles*. Thy daughter will he thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say when seeking to betroth her to another? Wilt say her virtue made her leave a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? Wilt thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? Unhappy wretch! Dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling grounds to promote serious mischief; nor should men, if we women are so deadly a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person to the penalty that lies in her husband's hands, seeing that I am no less chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; but for thee, there is one thing I fear in thy disposition; it was a quarrel for a woman that really induced thee to destroy poor *Ilium's* town.

**Chorus.**
    Thou hast said too much for a woman speaking to men;
    that discretion hath shot away its last shaft from thy soul's quiver.

**Menelaus.**
Woman, these are petty matters, unworthy, as thou sayest, of my despotic sway, unworthy too of *Hellas*. Yet mark this well; his special fancy of the hour is of more moment to a man than *Troy's* capture. I then have set myself to help my daughter because I consider her loss of a wife's rights a grave matter; for whatever else a woman suffers is secondary to this; if she loses her husband's love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it is right *Neoptolemus* should rule my slaves, so my friends and I should have control of his; for friends, if they be really friends, keep nothing to themselves, but have all in common. So if I wait for the absent instead of making the best arrangement I can at once of my affairs, I show weakness, not wisdom. Arise then, leave the goddess's shrine, for by thy death this child escapeth his, whereas, if thou refuse to die, I will slay him; for one of you twain must perish.

**Andromache.**
Ah me! 'tis a bitter lot thou art offering about my life; whether I take it or not I am equally unfortunate. Attend to me, thou who for a trifling cause art committing an awful crime. Why art thou bent on slaying me? What reason hast thou? What city have I betrayed? Which of thy children was ever slain by me? What house have I fired? I was forced to be my master's concubine; and spite of that wilt thou slay me, not him who is to blame, passing by the cause and hurrying to the inevitable result? Ah me! my sorrows! Woe for my hapless country! How cruel my fate! Why had I to be a mother too and take upon me a double load of suffering? Yet why do I mourn the past, and o'er the present never shed a tear or compute its griefs? I that saw *Hector* butchered and dragged behind the chariot, and *Ilium*, piteous sight! one sheet of flame, while I was haled away by the hair of my head to the *Argive* ships in slavery, and on my arrival in *Phthia* was assigned to *Hector's* murderer as his mistress. What pleasure then has life for me? Whither am I to turn my gaze? to the present or the past? My babe alone was left me, the light of my life; and him these ministers of death would slay. No! they shall not, if my poor life can save him; for if he be saved, hope in him lives on, while to me 'twere shame to refuse to die for my son. Lo! here I leave the altar and give myself into your hands, to cut or stab, to bind or hang. Ah! my child, to *Hades* now thy mother passes to save thy dear life. Yet if thou escape thy doom, remember me, my sufferings and my death, and tell thy father how I fared, with fond caress and streaming eye and arms thrown round his neck. Ah! yes, his children are to every man as his own soul; and whoso sneers at this through inexperience, though he suffers less anguish, yet tastes the bitter in his cup of bliss.

**Chorus.**
    Thy tale with pity fills me;
    for every man alike, stranger though he be,
    feels pity for another's distress.
    *Menelaus*, 'tis thy duty to reconcile thy daughter and this captive,
    giving her a respite from sorrow.

**Menelaus.**
Ho! sirrahs, catch me this woman; hold her fast; for 'tis no welcome story she will have to hear.

It was to make thee leave the holy altar of the goddess that I held thy child's death before thy eyes, and so induced thee to give thyself up to me to die. So stands thy case, be well assured; but as for this child, my daughter shall decide whether she will slay him or no. Get thee hence into the house, and there learn to bridle thy insolence in speaking to the free, slave that thou art.

**Andromache.**
Alas! thou hast by treachery beguiled me; I was deceived.

**Menelaus.**
Proclaim it to the world; I do not deny it.

**Andromache.**
Is this counted cleverness amongst you who dwell by the *Eurotas*?

**Menelaus.**
Yes, and amongst *Trojans* too, that those who suffer should retaliate.

**Andromache.**
Thinkest thou God's hand is shortened, and that thou wilt not be punished?

**Menelaus.**
Whene'er that comes, I am ready to bear it. But thy life will I have.

**Andromache.**
Wilt likewise slay this tender chick, whom thou hast snatched from 'neath my wing?

**Menelaus.**
Not I, but I will give him to my daughter to slay if she will.

**Andromache.**
Ah me! why not begin my mourning then for thee, my child?

**Menelaus.**
Of a truth 'tis no very sure hope that he has left.

**Andromache.**
O citizens of *Sparta*, the bane of all the race of men, schemers of guile, and masters in lying, devisers of evil plots, with crooked minds and tortuous methods and ne'er one honest thought, 'tis wrong that ye should thrive in *Hellas*. What crime is wanting in your list? How rife is murder with you! How covetous ye are! One word upon your lips, another in your heart, this is what men always find with you. Perdition catch ye! Still death is not so grievous, as thou thinkest, to me. No! for my life ended in the day that hapless *Troy* was destroyed with my lord, that glorious warrior, whose spear oft made a coward like thee quit the field and seek thy ship. But now against a woman hast thou displayed the terrors of thy panoply, my would-be murderer. Strike then! for this my tongue shall never flatter thee or that daughter of thine. For though thou wert of great account in *Sparta*, why so was I in *Troy*. And if I am now in sorry plight, presume not thou on this; thou too mayst be so yet.

*Exeunt ANDROMACHE, MENELAUS, and MOLOSSUS.*

**Chorus.**
    Never, oh! never will I commend rival wives
    or sons of different mothers,
    a cause of strife, of bitterness, and grief in every house.
    I would have a husband content with one wife
    whose rights he shareth with no other.
    Not even in states is dual monarchy better to bear
    than undivided rule; it only doubles burdens
    and causes faction amongst the citizens.
    Often too will the *Muse* sow strife 'twixt rivals in the art of minstrelsy.
    Again, when strong winds are drifting mariners,
    the divided counsel of the wise is not conducive to steering,
    and their collective wisdom has less weight
    than the inferior intelligence of the single man who has sole authority;
    for this is the essence of power alike in house and state,
    whene'er men care to find the proper moment.
    This *Spartan*, the daughter of the great chief *Menelaus*, proves this;
    for she hath kindled hot fury against a rival,
    and is bent on slaying the hapless *Trojan* maid and her child
    to further her bitter quarrel.
    'Tis a murder gods and laws and kindness all forbid.
    Ah! lady, retribution for this deed will visit thee yet.

    But lo! before the house I see those two united souls,
    condemned to die.
    Alas! for thee, poor lady, and for thee, unhappy child,
    who art dying on account of thy mother's marriage,
    though thou hast no share therein and canst not be blamed by the royal house.

*Enter MENELAUS, leading ANDROMACHE and MOLOSSUS.*

**Andromache.**
Behold me journeying on the downward path,

---
[^1]: In *Cilicia*.
[^2]: *Hermione*.

# Andromache

**Andromache**
My hands so tightly bound with cords that they bleed.

**Molossus**
O mother, mother mine! I too share
Thy downward path, nestling 'neath thy wing.

**Andromache**
A cruel sacrifice! ye rulers of Phthia!

**Molossus**
Come, father! succour those thou lovest.

**Andromache**
Rest there, my babe, my darling! on thy
Mother's bosom, e'en in death and in the grave.

**Molossus**
Ah, woe is me! what will become of me and
Thee too, mother mine?

**Menelaus**
Away, to the world below! from hostile towers
Ye came, the pair of you; two different causes
Necessitate your deaths; my sentence takes away thy
Life, and my daughter Hermione's requires his; for
It would be the height of folly to leave our foemen's
Sons, when we might kill them and remove the danger
From our house.

**Andromache**
O husband mine! I would I had thy strong
Arm and spear to aid me, son of Priam.

**Molossus**
Ah, woe is me! what spell can I now find to
Turn death's stroke aside?

**Andromache**
Embrace thy master's knees, my child, and
Pray to him.

**Molossus**
Spare, O spare my life, kind master!

**Andromache**
Mine eyes are wet with tears, which trickle
Down my cheeks, as doth a sunless spring from a
Smooth rock. Ah me!

**Molossus**
What remedy, alas! can I provide me 'gainst
My ills?

**Menelaus**
Why fall at my knees in supplication? hard
As the rock and deaf as the wave am I. My own
Friends have I helped, but for thee have I no tie of
Affection; for verily it cost me a great part of my
Life to capture Troy and thy mother; so thou shalt
Reap the fruit thereof and into Hades' halls descend.

**Chorus**
Behold! I see Peleus drawing nigh; with aged
Step he hasteth hither.

*Enter Peleus, with attendant.*

**Peleus**
*(Calling out as he comes in sight)*
What means this? I ask you and your executioner; why is
The palace in an uproar? give a reason; what mean
Your lawless machinations? Menelaus, hold thy
Hand. Seek not to outrun justice.
*(To his attendant)*
Forward! faster, faster! for this matter, methinks,
Admits of no delay; now if ever would I fain resume
The vigour of my youth. First however will I breathe
New life into this captive, being to her as the breeze
That blows a ship before the wind. Tell me, by what
Right have they pinioned thine arms and are dragging
Thee and thy child away? like a ewe with her lamb
Art thou led to the slaughter, while I and thy lord
Were far away.

**Andromache**
Behold them that are haling me and my child
To death, e'en as thou seest, aged prince. Why should
I tell thee? For not by one urgent summons alone
But by countless messengers have I sent for thee.
No doubt thou knowest by hearsay of the strife
In this house with this man's daughter, and the reason
Of my ruin. So now they have torn and are dragging
Me from the altar of Thetis, the goddess of thy chiefest
Adoration and the mother of thy gallant son,
Without any proper trial, yea, and without waiting
For my absent master; because, forsooth, they knew
My defencelessness and my child's, whom they mean
To slay with me his hapless mother, though he has
Done no harm. But to thee, O sire, I make my supplication,
Prostrate at thy knees, though my hand cannot touch
Thy friendly beard; save me, I adjure thee, reverend sir,
Or to thy shame and my sorrow shall we be slain.

**Peleus**
Loose her bonds, I say, ere some one rue it;
Untie her folded hands.

**Menelaus**
I forbid it, for besides being a match for
Thee, I have a far better right to her.

**Peleus**
What! art thou come hither to set my house
In order? Art not content with ruling thy Spartans?

**Menelaus**
She is my captive; I took her from Troy.

**Peleus**
Aye, but my son's son received her as his prize.

**Menelaus**
Is not all I have his, and all his mine?

**Peleus**
For good, but not evil ends; and surely not
For murderous violence.

**Menelaus**
Never shalt thou wrest her from my grasp.

**Peleus**
With this good staff I'll stain thy head with
Blood!

**Menelaus**
Just touch me and see! Approach one step!

**Peleus**
What! shalt thou rank with men? chief of
Cowards, son of cowards! What right hast thou to
Any place 'mongst men? Thou who didst let a Phrygian
Rob thee of thy wife, leaving thy home without
Bolt or guard, as if forsooth the cursed woman thou
Hadst there was a model of virtue. No! a Spartan
Maid could not be chaste, e'en if she would, who
Leaves her home and bares her limbs and lets her
Robe float free, to share with youths their races and
Their sports — customs I cannot away with. Is it any
Wonder then that ye fail to educate your women in
Virtue? Helen might have asked thee this, seeing
That she said goodbye to thy affection and tripped
Off with her young gallant to a foreign land. And
Yet for her sake thou didst marshal all the hosts of
Hellas and lead them to Ilium, whereas thou shouldst
Have shown thy loathing for her by refusing to stir
A spear, once thou hadst found her false; yea, thou
Shouldst have let her stay there, and even paid a
Price to save ever having her back again. But that
Was not at all the way thy thoughts were turned;
Wherefore many a brave life hast thou ended, and
Many an aged mother hast thou left childless in her
Home, and grey-haired sires of gallant sons hast reft.
Of that sad band am I a member, seeing in thee
Achilles' murderer like a malignant fiend; for thou
And thou alone hast returned from Troy without a
Scratch, bringing back thy splendid weapons in their
Splendid cases just as they went. As for me, I ever
Told that amorous boy to form no alliance with thee
Nor take unto his home an evil mother's child; for
Daughters bear the marks of their mothers' ill-repute
Into their new homes. Wherefore, ye wooers, take
Heed to this my warning: "Choose the daughter of
A good mother." And more than this, with what
Wanton insult didst thou treat thy brother, bidding
Him sacrifice his daughter in his simpleness! So fearful
Wast thou of losing thy worthless wife. Then after
Capturing Troy — for thither too will I accompany
Thee — thou didst not slay that woman, when she
Was in thy power; but as soon as thine eyes caught
Sight of her breast, thy sword was dropped and thou
Didst take her kisses, fondling the shameless traitress,
Too weak to stem thy hot desire, thou caitiff wretch!
Yet spite of all thou art the man to come and work
Havoc in my grandson's halls when he is absent,
Seeking to slay with all indignity a poor weak woman
And her babe; but that babe shall one day make
Thee and thy daughter in thy home rue it, e'en
Though his birth be trebly base. Yea, for oft ere now
Hath seed, sown on barren soil, prevailed o'er rich
Deep tilth, and many a bastard has proved a better
Man than children better born. Take thy daughter
Hence with thee! Far better is it for mortals to have
A poor honest man either as married kin or friend
Than a wealthy knave; but as for thee, thou art a
Thing of naught.

**Chorus**
The tongue from trifling causes contrives to
Breed great strife 'mongst men; wherefore are the
Wise most careful not to bring about a quarrel with
Their friends.

**Menelaus**
Why, pray, should one call these old men
Wise, or those who once had a reputation in Hellas
For being so? when thou, the great Peleus, son of a
Famous father, connected with me by marriage, employest
Language disgraceful to thyself and abusive
Of me because of a barbarian woman, though thou
Shouldst have banished her far beyond the streams
Of Nile or Phasis, and ever encouraged me; seeing
That she comes from Asia's continent where fell so
Many of the sons of Hellas, victims to the spear; and
Likewise because she shared in the spilling of thy
Son's blood; for Paris who slew thy son Achilles,
Was brother to Hector, whose wife she was. And
Dost thou enter the same abode with her, and deign
To let her share thy board, and suffer her to rear her
Brood of vipers in thy house? But I, after all this
Foresight for thee, old man, and myself, am to have
Her torn from my clutches for wishing to slay her.
Yet come now, for there is no disgrace in arguing
The matter out; suppose my daughter has no child,
While this woman's sons grow up, wilt thou set them
Up to rule the land of Phthia, barbarians born and
Bred to lord it over Hellenes? Am I then so void of
Sense because I hate injustice, and thou so full of
Cleverness? Consider yet another point; say thou
Hadst given a daughter of thine to some citizen, and
Hadst then seen her thus treated, wouldst thou have
Sat looking on in silence? I trow not. Dost thou then
For a foreigner rail thus at thy nearest friends? Again,
Thou mayst say, husband and wife have an equally
Strong case if she is wronged by him, and similarly
If he find her guilty of indiscretion in his house; yet
While he has ample powers in his own hands, she
Depends on parents and friends for her case. Surely
Then I am right in helping my own kin! Thou art
In thy dotage; for thou wilt do me more good by
Speaking of my generalship than by concealing it.
Helen's trouble was not of her own choosing, but
Sent by heaven, and it proved a great benefit to
Hellas; her sons, till then untried in war or arms,
Turned to deeds of prowess, and it is experience which
Teaches man all he knows. I showed my wisdom in
Refraining from slaying my wife, directly I caught
Sight of her. Would that thou too hadst ne'er slain
Phocus! All this I bring before thee in pure goodwill,
Not from anger. But if thou resent it, thy
Tongue may wag till it ache, yet shall I gain by prudent
Forethought.

**Chorus**
Cease now from idle words, 'twere better far,
For fear ye both alike go wrong.

**Peleus**
Alas! what evil customs now prevail in Hellas!
Whene'er the host sets up a trophy o'er the foe, men
No more consider this the work of those who really
Toiled, but the general gets the credit for it. Now he
Was but one among ten thousand others to brandish
His spear; he only did the work of one; but yet he
Wins more praise than they. Again, as magistrates in
All the grandeur of office they scorn the common
Folk, though they are naught themselves; whereas
Those others are ten thousand times more wise than
They, if daring combine with judgment. Even so
Thou and thy brother, exalted by the toilsome efforts
Of others, now take your seats in all the swollen
Pride of Trojan fame and Trojan generalship. But
I will teach thee henceforth to consider Idaean Paris
A foe less terrible than Peleus, unless forthwith thou
Pack from this roof, thou and thy childless daughter
Too, whom my own true son will hale through
His halls by the hair of her head; for her barrenness
Will not let her endure fruitfulness in others, because
She has no children herself. Still if she is unlucky in
The matter of offspring, is that a reason why we
Should be left childless? Begone! ye varlets, let her
Go! I will soon see if anyone will hinder me from
Loosing her hands.
*(To Andromache)*
Arise; these trembling hands
Of mine will untie the twisted thongs that bind thee.
Out on thee, coward! is this how thou hast galled
Her wrists? Didst think thou wert lashing up a lion
Or bull? or wert afraid she would snatch a sword
And defend herself against thee? Come, child, nestle
To thy mother's arms; help me loose her bonds;
I will yet rear thee in Phthia to be their bitter foe.
If your reputation for prowess and the battles ye have
Fought were taken from you Spartans, in all else, be
Very sure, you have not your inferiors.

**Chorus**
The race of old men practises no restraint;
And their testiness makes it hard to check them.

**Menelaus**
Thou art only too ready to rush into abuse;
While, as for me, I came to Phthia by constraint and
Have therefore no intention either of doing or suffering
Anything mean. Now must I return home, for
I have no time to waste; for there is a city not so
Very far from Sparta, which aforetime was friendly
But now is hostile; against her will I march with my
Army and bring her into subjection. And when I
Have arranged that matter as I wish, I will return;
And face to face with my son-in-law I will give my
Version of the story and hear his. And if he punish
Her, and for the future she exercise self-control, she
Shall find me do the like; but if he storm, I'll storm
As well; and every act of mine shall be a reflex of his
Own. As for thy babbling, I can bear it easily; for,
Like to a shadow as thou art, thy voice is all thou
Hast, and thou art powerless to do aught but talk.

*Exit Menelaus.*

**Peleus**
Lead on, my child, safe beneath my sheltering
Wing, and thou too, poor lady; for thou art come
Into a quiet haven after the rude storm.

**Andromache**
Heaven reward thee and all thy race, old sire,
For having saved my child and me his hapless mother!
Only beware lest they fall upon us twain in some
Lonely spot upon the road and force me from thee,
When they see thy age, my weakness, and this child's
Tender years; take heed to this, that we be not a
Second time made captive, after escaping now.

**Peleus**
Forbear such words, prompted by a woman's
Cowardice. Go on thy way; who will lay a finger on
You? Methinks he will do it to his cost. For by
Heaven's grace I rule o'er many a knight and spearman
Bold in my kingdom of Phthia; yea, and myself
Can still stand straight, no bent old man as thou
Dost think; such a fellow as that a mere look from
Me will put to flight in spite of my years. For e'en
An old man, be he brave, is worth a host of raw
Youths; for what avails a fine figure if a man is a
Coward?

*Exeunt Peleus, Andromache, and Molossus.*

**Chorus**
Oh! to have never been born, or sprung from
Noble sires, the heir to mansions richly stored; for
If aught untoward e'er befall, there is no lack of
Champions for sons of noble parents, and there is
Honour and glory for them when they are proclaimed
Scions of illustrious lines; time detracts not from the
Legacy these good men leave, but the light of their
Goodness still burns on when they are dead. Better
Is it not to win a discreditable victory, than to make
Justice miscarry by an invidious exercise of power;
For such a victory, though men think it sweet for the
Moment, grows barren in time and comes very near
Being a family reproach. This is the life I commend,
This the life I set before me as my ideal, to exercise
No authority beyond what is right either in the marriage-chamber
Or in the state. O aged son of *Aeacus*!
Now am I sure that thou wert with the Lapithae,
Wielding thy famous spear, when they fought the
Centaurs; and on Argo's deck didst pass the cheerless
Strait beyond the sea-beat Symplegades on her
Voyage of note; and when in days long gone the son
Of Zeus spread slaughter round Troy's famous town,
Thou too didst share his triumphant return to Europe.

*Enter Nurse.*

**Nurse**
Alas! good friends, what a succession of
Troubles is to-day provided us! My mistress Hermione
Within the house, deserted by her father and in
Remorse for her monstrous deed in plotting the death
Of Andromache and her child, is bent on dying; for
She is afraid her husband will in requital for this expel
Her with dishonour from his house or put her
To death, because she tried to slay the innocent. And
The servants that watch her can scarce restrain her
Efforts to hang herself, scarce catch the sword and
Wrest it from her hand. So bitter is her anguish, and
She hath recognized the villainy of her former deeds.
As for me, friends, I am weary of keeping my mistress
From the fatal noose; do ye go in and try to
Save her life; for if strangers come, they prove more
Persuasive than the friends of every day.

**Chorus**
Ah yes! I hear an outcry in the house amongst
The servants, confirming the news thou hast brought.
Poor sufferer! she seems about to show a lively grief
For her grave crimes; for she has escaped her servants'
Hands and is rushing from the house, eager to
End her life.

**Hermione**
*(Rushing wildly on to the stage)*
Woe, woe is
Me! I will tear my hair and scratch cruel furrows in
My cheeks.

**Nurse**
My child, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou disfigure
Thyself?

**Hermione**
Ah me! ah me! Begone, thou fine-spun veil!
Float from my head away!

**Nurse**
Daughter, cover up thy bosom, fasten thy
Robe.

**Hermione**
Why should I cover it? My crimes against
My lord are manifest and clear, they cannot be
Hidden.

**Nurse**
Art so grieved at having devised thy rival's
Death?

**Hermione**
Indeed I am; I deeply mourn my fatal deeds
Of daring; alas! I am now accursed in all men's eyes!

**Nurse**
Thy husband will pardon thee this error.

**Hermione**
Oh! why didst thou hunt me to snatch away
My sword? Give, oh! give it back, dear nurse, that
I may thrust it through my heart. Why dost thou
Prevent me hanging myself?

**Nurse**
What! was I to let thy madness lead thee on
To death?

**Hermione**
Ah me, my destiny! Where can I find some
Friendly fire? To what rocky height can I climb
Above the sea or 'mid some wooded mountain glen,
There to die and trouble but the dead?

**Nurse**
Why vex thyself thus? on all of us sooner or
Later heaven's visitation comes.

**Hermione**
Thou hast left me, O my father, left me like
A stranded bark, all alone, without an oar. My lord
Will surely slay me; no home is mine henceforth beneath
My husband's roof. What god is there to whose
Statue I can as a suppliant haste? or shall I throw
Myself in slavish wise at slavish knees? Would I
Could speed away from Phthia's land on bird's dark
Pinion, or like that pine-built ship, [^1] the first that
Ever sailed betwixt the rocks Cyanean!

**Nurse**
My child, I can as little praise thy previous
Sinful excesses, committed against the Trojan captive,
As thy present exaggerated terror. Thy husband
Will never listen to a barbarian's weak pleading
And reject his marriage with thee for this. For thou
Wast no captive from Troy whom he wedded, but
The daughter of a gallant sire, with a rich dower,
From a city too of no mean prosperity. Nor will thy
Father forsake thee, as thou dreadest, and allow thee
To be cast out from this house. Nay, enter now, nor
Show thyself before the palace, lest the sight of thee
There bring reproach upon thee, my daughter.

**Chorus**
Lo! a stranger of foreign appearance from
Some other land comes hurrying towards us.

*Enter Orestes.*

**Orestes**
Ladies of this foreign land! is this the
Home, the palace of Achilles' son?

**Chorus**
Thou hast it; but who art thou to ask such a
Question?

**Orestes**
The son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra,
By name Orestes, on my way to the oracle of Zeus
At Dodona. But now that I am come to Phthia, I am
Resolved to inquire about my kinswoman, Hermione
Of Sparta; is she alive and well? for though she dwells
In a land far from my own, I love her none the less.

**Hermione**
Son of Agamemnon, thy appearing is as a
Haven from the storm to sailors; by thy knees I pray,
Have pity on me in my distress, on me of whose fortunes
Thou art inquiring. About thy knees I twine
My arms with all the force of sacred fillets.

**Orestes**
Ha! what is this? Am I mistaken or do I really
See before me the queen of this palace, the daughter
Of Menelaus?

**Hermione**
The same, that only child whom Helen,
Daughter of Tyndareus, bore my father in his halls;
Never doubt that.

**Orestes**
O saviour Phoebus, grant us respite from our
Woe! But what is the matter? art thou afflicted by
Gods or men?

**Hermione**
Partly by myself, partly by the man who
Wedded me, and partly by some god. On every side
I see ruin.

**Orestes**
Why, what misfortune could happen to a woman
As yet childless, unless her honour is concerned?

**Hermione**
My very complaint! Thou hast hit my case
Exactly.

**Orestes**
On whom has thy husband set his affections
In thy stead?

**Hermione**
On his captive, Hector's wife.

**Orestes**
An evil case indeed, for a man to have two
Wives.

**Hermione**
'Tis even thus. So I resented it.

**Orestes**
Didst thou with woman's craft devise a plot
Against thy rival?

**Hermione**
Yes, to slay her and her bastard child.

**Orestes**
And didst thou slay them, or did something
Happen to rescue them from thee?

**Hermione**
It was old Peleus, who showed regard to the
Weaker side.

**Orestes**
Hadst thou any accomplice in this attempted
Murder?

**Hermione**
My father came from Sparta for this very
Purpose.

**Orestes**
And was he after all defeated by that old
Man's prowess?

**Hermione**
Oh no! but by shame; and he hath gone and
Left me all alone.

**Orestes**
I understand; thou art afraid of thy husband
For what thou hast done.

**Hermione**
Thou hast guessed it; for he will have a right
To slay me. What can I say for myself? Yet I beseech
Thee by Zeus the god of our family, send me
To a land as far as possible from this, or to my father's
House; for these very walls seem to cry out
"Begone!" and all the land of Phthia hates me. But
If my lord return ere that from the oracle of Phoebus,
He will put me to death on a shameful charge,
Or enslave me to his mistress, whom I ruled before.
Maybe some one will say, "How was it thou didst
Go thus astray?" I was ruined by mischievous women
Who came to me and puffed me up with words
Like these: "What! wilt thou suffer that vile captive,
A mere bondmaid, to dwell within thy house and
Share thy wedded rights? By Heaven's queen! if it
Were my house she should not live to reap my marriage-harvest!"
And I listened to the words of these
Sirens, the cunning, knavish, subtle praters, and
Was filled with silly thoughts. What need had I to
Care about my lord? I had all I wanted, wealth in
Plenty, a house in which I was mistress, and as for
Children, mine would be born in wedlock, while
Hers would be bastards, half-slaves to mine. Oh!
Never, never — this truth will I repeat — should men
Of sense, who have wives, allow women-folk to visit
Them in their homes, for they teach them mischief;
One, to gain some private end, helps to corrupt their
Honour; another, having made a slip herself, wants
A companion in misfortune, while many are wantons;
And hence it is men's houses are tainted. Wherefore
Keep strict guard upon the portals of your
Houses with bolts and bars; for these visits of strange
Women lead to no good result, but a world of mischief.

**Chorus**
Thou hast given thy tongue too free a rein
Regarding thy own sex. I can pardon thee in this
Case, but still women ought to smooth over their
Sisters' weaknesses.

**Orestes**
'Twas sage counsel he gave who taught men
To hear the arguments on both sides. I, for instance,
Though aware of the confusion in this house, the
Quarrel between thee and Hector's wife, waited
Awhile and watched to see whether thou wouldst stay
Here or from fear of that captive art minded to quit
These halls. Now it was not so much regard for thy
Message that brought me hither, as the intention of
Carrying thee away from this house, if, as now, thou
Shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou
Wert mine formerly, but art now living with thy
Present husband through thy father's baseness; since
He, before invading Troy's domains, betrothed thee
To me, and then afterwards promised thee to thy
Present lord, provided he captured the city of Troy.
So, as soon as Achilles' son returned hither, I forgave
Thy father, but entreated the bridegroom to
Forego his marriage with thee, telling him all I had
Gone through and my present misfortune; I might
Get a wife, I said, from amongst friends, but outside
Their circle 'twas no easy task for one exiled like myself
From home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting
Me with my mother's murder and those blood-boltered
Fiends. And I was humbled by the fortunes
Of my house, and though 'tis true, I grieved, yet did
I endure my sorrow, and reluctantly departed,
Robbed of thy promised hand. Now therefore, since
Thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and
Art fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will
Take thee hence and place thee in thy father's hands.
For kinship hath strong claims, and in adversity
There is naught better than a kinsman's kindly aid.

**Hermione**
As for my marriage, my father must look to
It; 'tis not for me to decide that. Yes, take me hence
As soon as may be, lest my husband come back to
His house before I am gone, or Peleus hear that I am
Deserting his son's abode and pursue me on horseback.

**Orestes**
Rest easy about the old man's power; and, as
For Achilles' son with all his insolence to me, never
Fear him; such a crafty net this hand hath woven and
Set for his death with knots that none can loose;
Whereof I will not speak before the time, but, when
My plot begins to work, Delphi's rock will witness
It. If but my allies in the Pythian land abide by
Their oaths, this same murderer of his mother will
Show that no one else shall marry thee my rightful
Bride. To his cost will he demand satisfaction of
King Phoebus for his father's blood; nor shall his
Repentance avail him, though he is now submitting
To the god. No! he shall perish miserably by Apollo's
Hand and my false accusations; so shall he find out
My enmity. For the deity upsets the fortune of them
That hate him, and suffers them not to be high-minded.

*Exeunt Orestes and Hermione.*

**Chorus**
O Phoebus! who didst fence the hill of Ilium
With a fair coronal of towers, and thou, ocean-god!
Coursing o'er the main with thy dark steeds, wherefore
Did ye hand over in dishonour your own handiwork
To the war-god, master of the spear, abandoning
Troy to wretchedness? Many a well-horsed car
Ye yoked on the banks of Simois, and many a bloody
Tournament did ye ordain with never a prize to win;
And Ilium's princes are dead and gone; no longer in
Troy is seen the blaze of fire on altars of the gods
With the smoke of incense. The son of Atreus is no
More, slain by the hand of his wife, and she herself
Hath paid the debt of blood by death, and from her
Children's hands received her doom. The god's own
Bidding from his oracle was levelled against her, in
The day that Agamemnon's son set forth from Argos
And visited his shrine; so he slew her, aye, spilt his
Own mother's blood. O Phoebus, O thou power divine,
How can I believe the story? Anon wherever
Hellenes gather, was heard the voice of lamentation,
Mothers weeping o'er their children's fate, as they
Left their homes to mate with strangers. Ah! thou
Art not the only one, nor thy dear ones either, on
Whom the cloud of grief hath fallen. Hellas had to
Bear the visitation, and thence the scourge crossed
To Phrygia's fruitful fields, raining the bloody drops
The death god loves.

*Enter Peleus.*

**Peleus**
Ye dames of Phthia, answer my questions. I
Heard a vague rumour that the daughter of Menelaus
Had left these halls and fled; so now am I come
In hot haste to learn if this be true; for it is the duty
Of those who are at home to labour in the interests
Of their absent friends.

**Chorus**
Thou hast heard aright, O Peleus; ill would

[^1]: Argo.

# Andromache

*Lines 1087-1146*

Ch. It becomes me to hide the evil case in which I now
find myself; our queen has fled and left these halls.

Pe. What was she afraid of? Explain that to me.

Ch. She was fearful her lord would cast her out.

Pe. In return for plotting his child’s death? Surely
not?

Ch. Yea, and she was afraid of yon captive.

Pe. With whom did she leave the house? With her
father?

Ch. The son of *Agamemnon* came and took her
hence.

Pe. What view has he to further thereby? Will
he marry her?

Ch. Yes, and he is plotting thy grandson’s death.

Pe. From an ambuscade, or meeting him fairly
face to face?

Ch. In the holy place of *Loxias*, leagued with
*Delphians*.

Pe. God help us! This is an immediate danger.
Hasten one of you with all speed to the *Pythian*
altar and tell our friends there what has happened
here, ere *Achilles’* son be slain by his enemies.

*Enter a messenger.*

Messenger. Woe worth the day! What evil tidings
have I brought for thee, old sire, and for all who love
my master! Woe is me!

Pe. Alas! My prophetic soul has a presentiment.

Mes. Aged *Peleus*, hearken! Thy grandson is no
more; so grievously is he smitten by the men of
*Delphi* and the stranger[^1] from *Mycenae*.

Ch. Ah! What wilt thou do, old man? Fall not;
uplift thyself.

Pe. I am a thing of naught; death is come upon
me. My voice is choked, my limbs droop beneath
me.

Mes. Hearken; if thou art eager also to avenge
thy friends, lift up thyself and hear what happened.

Pe. Ah, destiny! How tightly hast thou caught me
in thy toils, a poor old man at life’s extremest verge!
But tell me how he was taken from me, my one
son’s only child; unwelcome as such news is, I fain
would hear it.

Mes. As soon as we reached the famous soil of
*Phoebus*, for three whole days were we feasting our
eyes with the sight. And this, it seems, caused sus-
picion; for the folk, who dwell near the god’s shrine,
began to collect in groups, while *Agamemnon’s* son,
going to and fro through the town, would whisper
in each man’s ear malignant hints: “Do ye see yon
fellow, going in and out of the god’s treasure-
chambers, which are full of the gold stored there by
all mankind? He is come hither a second time on
the same mission as before, eager to sack the temple
of *Phoebus*.” Thereon there ran an angry murmur
through the city, and the magistrates flocked to
their council-chamber, while those, who have charge
of the god’s treasures, had a guard privately placed
amongst the colonnades. But we, knowing naught
as yet of this, took sheep fed in the pastures of *Parnassus*,
and went our way and stationed ourselves
at the altars with vouchers and *Pythian* seers. And
one said: “What prayer, young warrior, wouldst thou
have us offer to the god? Wherefore art thou come?”
And he answered: “I wish to make atonement to
*Phoebus* for my past transgression; for once I claimed
from him satisfaction for my father’s blood.” There-
upon the rumour, spread by *Orestes*, proved to have
great weight, suggesting that my master was lying
and had come on a shameful errand. But he crosses
the threshold of the temple to pray to *Phoebus* be-
fore his oracle, and was busy with his burnt-offering;
when a body of men armed with swords set them-
selves in ambush against him in the cover of the
bay-trees, and *Clytaemnestra’s* son, that had con-
trived the whole plot, was one of them. There stood
the young man praying to the god in sight of all,
when lo! with their sharp swords they stabbed *Achilles’*
unprotected son from behind. But he stepped
back, for it was not a mortal wound he had received,
and drew his sword, and snatching armour from the
pegs where it hung on a pillar, took his stand upon
the altar-steps, the picture of a warrior grim; then
cried he to the sons of *Delphi*, and asked them:
“Why seek to slay me when I am come on a holy
mission? What cause is there why I should die?”
But of all that throng of bystanders, no man an-
swered him a word, but they set to hurling stones.
Then he, though bruised and battered by the show-
ers of missiles from all sides, covered himself behind
his mail and tried to ward off the attack, holding
his shield first here, then there, at arm’s length, but
all of no avail; for a storm of darts, arrows and jave-
lins, hurtling spits with double points, and butchers’
knives for slaying steers, came flying at his feet; and
terrible was the war-dance thou hadst then seen thy
grandson dance to avoid their marksmanship. At
last, when they were hemming him in on all sides,
allowing him no breathing space, he left the shelter
of the altar, the hearth where victims are placed,
and with one bound was on them as on the *Trojans*
of yore; and they turned and fled like doves when
they see the hawk. Many fell in the confusion; some
wounded, and others trodden down by one another
along the narrow passages; and in that hushed holy
house uprose unholy din and echoed back from the
rocks. Calm and still my master stood there in his

*Lines 1146-1214*

gleaming harness like a flash of light, till from the
inmost shrine there came a voice of thrilling horror,
stirring the crowd to make a stand. Then fell *Achilles’*
son, smitten through the flank by some *Delphian’s*
biting blade, some fellow that slew him with
a host to help; and as he fell, there was not one that
did not stab him, or cast a rock and batter his corpse.
So his whole body, once so fair, was marred
with savage wounds. At last they cast the lifeless clay,
lying near the altar, forth from the fragrant fane.
And we gathered up his remains forthwith and are
bringing them to thee, old prince, to mourn and
weep and honour with a deep-dug tomb.

This is how that prince who vouchsafes oracles
to others, that judge of what is right for all the
world, has revenged himself on *Achilles’* son, re-
membering his ancient quarrel as a wicked man
would. How then can he be wise?

*Exit MESSENGER.*

*The body of Neoptolemus is carried in on a bier.*

Ch. Lo! E’en now our prince is being carried on a
bier from *Delphi’s* land unto his home. Woe for him
and his sad fate, and woe for thee, old sire! For this is
not the welcome thou wouldst give *Achilles’* son,
the lion’s whelp; thyself too by this sad mischance
dost share his evil lot.

Pe. Ah! Woe is me! Here is a sad sight for me to see
and take unto my halls! Ah me! Ah me! I am undone,
thou city of *Thessaly*! My line now ends; I have no
children left me in my home. Oh! The sorrows I
seem born to endure! What friend can I look to for
relief? Ah, dear lips, and cheeks, and hands! Would
thy destiny had slain thee ’neath *Ilium’s* walls beside
the banks of *Simois*!

Ch. Had he so died, my aged lord, he had won him
honour thereby, and thine had been the happier lot.

Pe. O marriage, marriage, woe to thee! Thou bane
of my home, thou destroyer of my city! Ah my
child, my boy! Would that the honour of wedding
thee, fraught with evil as it was to my children and
house, had not thrown o’er thee, my son, *Hermione’s*
deadly net! O that the thunderbolt had slain
her sooner! And that thou, rash mortal, hadst never
charged the great god *Phoebus* with aiming that
murderous shaft that spilt thy hero-father’s blood!

Ch. Woe! Woe! Alas! With due observance of fun-
eral rites will I begin the mourning for my dead
master.

Pe. Alack and well-a-day! I take up the tearful
dirge, ah me! Old and wretched as I am.

Ch. ’Tis Heaven’s decree; God willed this heavy
stroke.

Pe. O darling child, thou hast left me all alone in
my halls, old and childless by thy loss.

Ch. Thou shouldst have died, old sire, before thy
children.

Pe. Shall I not tear my hair, and smite upon my
head with grievous blows? O city! Of both my chil-
dren has *Phoebus* robbed me.

Ch. What evils thou hast suffered, what sorrows
thou hast seen, thou poor old man! What shall be
thy life hereafter?

*Lines 1215-1275*

Pe. Childless, desolate, with no limit to my grief,
I must drain the cup of woe, until I die.

Ch. ’Twas all in vain the gods wished thee joy on
thy wedding day.

Pe. All my hopes have flown away, fallen short of
my high boasts.

Ch. A lonely dweller in a lonely home art thou.

Pe. I have no city any longer; there! On the ground
my sceptre do I cast; and thou, daughter of *Nereus*,
’neath thy dim grotto, shalt see me groveling in the
dust, a ruined king.

Ch. Look, look! *(A dim form of divine appearance
is seen hovering in mid air)* What is that moving?
What influence divine am I conscious of? Look, maid-
ens, mark it well; see, yonder is some deity, wafted
through the lustrous air and alighting on the plains
of *Phthia*, home of steeds.

*Thetis descends onto the stage.*

Thetis. O *Peleus*! Because of my wedded days with
thee now long agone, I *Thetis* am come from the
halls of *Nereus*. And first I counsel thee not to grieve
to excess in thy present distress, for I too who need
ne’er have borne children to my sorrow, have lost
the child of our love, *Achilles* swift of foot, foremost
of the sons of *Hellas*. Next will I declare why I am
come, and do thou give ear. Carry yonder corpse,
*Achilles’* son, to the *Pythian* altar and there bury
it, a reproach to *Delphi*, that his tomb may pro-
claim the violent death he met at the hand of *Orestes*.
And for his captive wife *Andromache*—she must
dwell in the *Molossian* land, united in honourable
wedlock with *Helenus*, and with her this babe, the
sole survivor as he is of all the line of *Aeacus*, for
from him a succession of prosperous kings of *Molossia*
is to go on unbroken; for the race that springs
from thee and me, my aged lord, must not thus be
brought to naught; no! Nor *Troy’s* line either; for
her fate too is cared for by the gods, albeit her fall
was due to the eager wish of *Pallas*. Thee too, that
thou mayst know the saving grace of wedding me,
will I, a goddess born and daughter of a god, release
from all the ills that flesh is heir to and make a deity
to know not death nor decay. From henceforth in
the halls of *Nereus* shalt thou dwell with me, god
and goddess together; thence shalt thou rise dry-
shod from out the main and see *Achilles*, our dear
son, settled in his island-home by the strand of *Leuce*,
that is girdled by the *Euxine* sea. But get thee to
*Delphi’s* god-built town, carrying this corpse with
thee, and, after thou hast buried him, return and
settle in the cave which time has hollowed in the
*Sepian* rock and there abide, till from the sea I come
with choir of fifty *Nereids* to be thy escort thence;
for fate’s decree thou must fulfil; such is the pleasure
of *Zeus*. Cease then to mourn the dead; this is the
lot which heaven assigns to all, and all must pay
their debt to death.

*Lines 1278-1283*

Pe. Great queen, my honoured wife, from *Nereus*
sprung, all hail! Thou art acting herein as befits thy-
self and thy children. So I will stay my grief at thy
bidding, goddess, and, when I have buried the dead,
will seek the glens of *Pelion*, even the place where I
took thy beauteous form to my embrace. *(Exit Thetis.)*
Surely after this every prudent man will seek
to marry a wife of noble stock and give his daughter
to a husband good and true, never setting his heart
on a worthless woman, not even though she bring
a sumptuous dowry to his house. So would men
ne’er suffer ill at heaven’s hand.

*Lines 1284-1288*

Ch. Many are the shapes of Heaven’s denizens,
and many a thing they bring to pass contrary to our
expectation; that which we thought would be is not
accomplished, while for the unexpected God finds
out a way. E’en such has been the issue of this
matter.

*Exeunt omnes.*

[^1]: i.e., *Orestes*.
