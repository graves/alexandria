Before Agamemnon's Tent in the Camp near Troy. Hecuba asleep. Enter Poseidon.

**Poseidon.**
Lo! from the depths of salt *Aegean* floods
I, Poseidon, come, where choirs of Nereids trip in
the mazes of the graceful dance; for since the day
that Phoebus and myself with measurement exact
set towers of stone about this land of Troy and
ringed it round, never from my heart hath passed
away a kindly feeling for my Phrygian town, which
now is smouldering and o’erthrown, a prey to Argive
prowess. For, from his home beneath Parnassus,
Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas,
framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed
host, and sent it within the battlements, fraught
with death; whence in days to come men shall tell
of "the wooden horse," with its hidden load of
warriors. Groves forsaken stand and temples of the
gods run down with blood, and at the altar’s very
base, before the god who watched his home, lies
Priam dead. While to Achaean ships great store of
gold and Phrygian spoils are being conveyed, and
they who came against this town, those sons of Hellas,
only wait a favouring breeze to follow in their wake,
that after ten long years they may with joy behold
their wives and children. Vanquished by Hera, Argive
goddess, and by Athena, who helped to ruin
Phrygia, I am leaving Ilium, that famous town, and
the altars that I love; for when drear desolation
seizes on a town, the worship of the gods decays and
tends to lose respect. Scamander’s banks re-echo
long and loud the screams of captive maids, as they
by lot receive their masters. Arcadia taketh some,
and some the folk of Thessaly; others are assigned
to Theseus’ sons, the Athenian chiefs. And such of
the Trojan dames as are not portioned out, are in
these tents, set apart for the leaders of the host; and
with them Spartan Helen, daughter of Tyndarus,
justly counted among the captives. And wouldst
thou see that queen of misery, Hecuba, thou canst;
for there she lies before the gates, weeping many a
bitter tear for many a tribulation; for at Achilles’
tomb—though she knows not this—her daughter
Polyxena has died most piteously; likewise is Priam
dead, and her children too; Cassandra, whom the
king Apollo left to be a virgin, frenzied maid, hath
Agamemnon, in contempt of the god’s ordinance
and of piety, forced to a dishonoured wedlock.
Farewell, O city prosperous once! farewell, ye
ramparts of hewn stone! had not Pallas, daughter
of Zeus, decreed thy ruin, thou wert standing firmly
still.

Enter Athena.

**Athena.**
May I address the mighty god whom
Heaven reveres and who to my own sire is very
nigh in blood, laying aside our former enmity?

**Poseidon.**
Thou mayst; for o’er the soul the ties of kin
exert no feeble spell, great queen Athena.

**Athena.**
For thy forgiving mood my thanks! Somewhat
have I to impart affecting both thyself and
me, O king.

**Poseidon.**
Bringst thou fresh tidings from some god,
from Zeus, or from some lesser power?

**Athena.**
From none of these; but on behalf of Troy,
whose soil we tread, am I come to seek thy mighty
aid, to make it one with mine.

**Poseidon.**
What! hast thou laid thy former hate aside
to take compassion on the town now that it is burnt
to ashes?

**Athena.**
First go back to the former point; wilt thou
make common cause with me in the scheme I pur¬pose?

**Poseidon.**
Ay surely; but I would fain learn thy wishes,
whether thou art come to help Achaeans or Phrygians.

**Athena.**
I wish to give my former foes, the Trojans,
joy, and on the Achaean host impose a return that
they will rue.

**Poseidon.**
Why leap’st thou thus from mood to mood?
Thy love and hate both go too far, on whomsoever
centred.

**Athena.**
Dost not know the insult done to me and to
the shrine I love?

**Poseidon.**
Surely, in the hour that Aias tore Cassandra
thence.

**Athena.**
Yea, and the Achaeans did naught, said naught
to him.

**Poseidon.**
And yet ’twas by thy mighty aid they sacked
Ilium.

**Athena.**
For which cause I would join with thee to
work their bane.

**Poseidon.**
My powers are ready at thy will. What is thy
intent?

**Athena.**
A returning fraught with woe will I impose
on them.

**Poseidon.**
While yet they stay on shore, or as they cross
the briny deep?

**Athena.**
When they have set sail from Ilium for their
homes. On them will Zeus also send his rain and
fearful hail, and inky tempests from the sky; yea,
and he promises to grant me his levin-bolts to hurl
on the Achaeans and fire their ships. And do thou,
for thy part, make the *Aegean* strait to roar with
mighty billows and whirlpools, and fill Euboea’s hol¬low
bay with corpses, that Achaeans may learn hence¬forth
to reverence my temples and regard all other
deities.

**Poseidon.**
So shall it be, for the boon thou cravest needs
but few words. I will vex the broad *Aegean* sea; and
the beach of Myconus and the reefs round Delos,
Scyros and Lemnos too, and the cliffs of Caphareus
shall be strown with many a corpse. Mount thou to
Olympus, and taking from thy father’s hand his
lightning bolts, keep careful watch against the hour
when Argos’ host lets slip its cables. A fool is he who
sacks the towns of men, with shrines and tombs, the
dead man’s hallowed home, for at the last he makes
a desert round him himself, and dies.

Exeunt.

**Hecuba (Awakening).**
Lift thy head, unhappy lady, from the ground;
Thy neck upraise; this is Troy no more,
No longer am I queen in Ilium.
Though fortune change, endure thy lot;
Sail with the stream, and follow fortune’s tack,
Steer not thy barque of life against the tide,
Since chance must guide thy course.
Ah me! ah me! What else but tears is now
My hapless lot, whose country, children, husband,
All are lost? Ah! the high-blown pride of ancestors!
How cabined now! how brought to nothing after all!
What woe must I suppress, or what declare?
What plaintive dirge shall I awake?
Ah, woe is me! the anguish I suffer
Lying here stretched upon this pallet hard!
O my head, my temples, my side!
Ah! could I but turn over, and lie now on this,
Now on that, to rest my back and spine,
While ceaselessly my tearful wail ascends.
For e’en this is music to the wretched,
To chant their cheerless dirge of sorrow.

Ye swift-prowed ships, rowed to sacred Ilium
O’er the deep dark sea, past the fair havens of Hellas,
To the flute’s ill-omened music and the dulcet voice of pipes,
Even to the bays of Troyland (alack the day!),
Wherein ye tied your hawsers, twisted handiwork from Egypt,
In quest of that hateful wife of Menelaus,
Who brought disgrace on Castor, and on Eurotas foul reproach;
Murderess she of Priam, sire of fifty children,
The cause why I, the hapless Hecuba,
Have wrecked my life upon this troublous strand.

Oh that I should sit here o’er against the tent of Agamemnon!
Forth from my home to slavery they hale my aged frame,
While from my head in piteous wise the hair is shorn for grief.
Ah! hapless wives of those mail-clad sons of Troy!
Ah! poor maidens, luckless brides, come weep,
For Ilium is now but a smouldering ruin;
And I, like some mother-bird that o’er her fledgelings screams,
Will begin the strain; how different from that song
I sang to the gods in days long past,
As I leaned on Priam’s staff, and beat with my foot
In Phrygian time to lead the dance!

Enter Chorus of Captive Trojan Women.

**Semi-Chorus 1.**
O Hecuba! why these cries, these piercing shrieks?
What mean thy words? For I heard thy piteous wail
Echo through the building, and a pang of terror
Shoots through each captive Trojan’s breast,
As pent within these walls they mourn their slavish lot.

**Hecuba.**
My child, e’en now the hands of Argive rowers
Are busy at their ships.

**Semi-Chorus 1.**
Ah, woe is me! what is their intent?
Will they really bear me hence in sorrow
From my country in their fleet?

**Hecuba.**
I know not, though I guess our doom.

**Semi-Chorus 1.**
O misery! woe to us Trojan dames,
Soon to hear the order given,
“Come forth from the house; the Argives
Are preparing to return.”

**Hecuba.**
Oh! do not bid the wild Cassandra leave her chamber,
The frantic prophetess, for Argives to insult,
Nor to my griefs add yet another.
Woe to thee, ill-fated Troy, thy sun is set;
And woe to thy unhappy children, quick and dead alike,
Who are leaving thee behind!

**Semi-Chorus 2.**
With trembling step, alas! I leave this tent of Agamemnon
To learn of thee, my royal mistress,
Whether the Argives have resolved to take my wretched life,
Whether the sailors at the prow are making ready to ply their oars.

**Hecuba.**
My child, a fearful dread seized on my wakeful heart
And sent me hither.

**Semi-Chorus 2.**
Hath a herald from the Danai already come?
To whom am I, poor captive, given as a slave?

**Hecuba.**
Thou art not far from being allotted now.

**Semi-Chorus 2.**
Woe worth the day! What Argive or Phthiotian chief
Will bear me far from Troy, alas! unto his home,
Or haply to some island fastness?

**Hecuba.**
Ah me! ah me! Whose slave shall I become in my old age?
In what far clime? a poor old drone,
The wretched copy of a corpse,
Set to keep the gate or tend their children,
I who once held royal rank in Troy.

**Chorus.**
Woe, woe is thee! What piteous dirge wilt thou devise
To mourn the outrage done thee?
No more through Ida’s looms shall I ply the shuttle to and fro.
I look my last and latest on my children’s bodies;
Henceforth shall I endure surpassing misery;
It may be as the unwilling bride of some Hellene
(Perish the night and fortune that brings me to this!);
It may be as a wretched slave I from Peirene’s sacred fount
Shall draw their store of water.

Oh! be it ours to come to Theseus’ famous realm,
A land of joy! Never, never let me see Eurotas’ swirling tide,
Hateful home of Helen, there to meet and be the slave of Menelaus,
Whose hand laid Troyland waste!
Yon holy land by Peneus fed, nestling in all its beauty
At Olympus’ foot, is said, so have I heard,
To be a very granary of wealth and teeming fruitage;
Next to the sacred soil of Theseus, I could wish to reach that land.
They tell me too Hephaestus’ home, beneath the shadow of *Etna*,
Fronting Phoenicia, the mother of Sicilian hills,
Is famous for the crowns it gives to worth.
Or may I find a home on that shore which lieth very nigh Ionia’s sea,
A land by Crathis watered, lovely stream,
That dyes the hair an auburn tint,
Feeding with its holy waves and making glad therewith
The home of heroes good and true.

But mark! a herald from the host of Danai,
With store of fresh proclamations, comes hasting hither.
What is his errand? what saith he?
List, for we are slaves to Dorian lords henceforth.

Enter Talthybius.

**Talthybius.**
Hecuba, thou knowest me from my
many journeys to and fro as herald ’twixt the Achaean
host and Troy; no stranger I to thee, lady, even
aforetime, I Talthybius, now sent with a fresh mes¬sage.

**Hecuba.**
Ah, kind friends, ’tis come! what I so long
have dreaded.

**Talthybius.**
The lot has decided your fates already, if that
was what you feared.

**Hecuba.**
Ah me! What city didst thou say, Thessalian,
Phthian, or Cadmean?

**Talthybius.**
Each warrior took his prize in turn; ye were
not all at once assigned.

**Hecuba.**
To whom hath the lot assigned us severally?
Which of us Trojan dames doth a happy fortune
await?

**Talthybius.**
I know, but ask thy questions separately, not
all at once.

**Hecuba.**
Then tell me, whose prize is my daughter,
hapless Cassandra?

**Talthybius.**
King Agamemnon hath chosen her out for
himself.

**Hecuba.**
To be the slave-girl of his Spartan wife? Ah
me!

**Talthybius.**
Nay, to share with him his stealthy love.

**Hecuba.**
What! Phoebus’ virgin-priestess, to whom
the god with golden locks granted the boon of maid¬enhood?

**Talthybius.**
The dart of love hath pierced his heart, love
for the frenzied maid.

**Hecuba.**
Daughter, cast from thee the sacred keys,
And from thy body tear the holy wreaths
That drape thee in their folds.

**Talthybius.**
Why! is it not an honour high that she should
win our monarch’s love?

**Hecuba.**
What have ye done to her whom late ye
took from me—my child?

**Talthybius.**
Dost mean Polyxena, or whom dost thou in¬quire
about?

**Hecuba.**
To whom hath the lot assigned her?

**Talthybius.**
To minister at Achilles’ tomb hath been ap¬pointed
her.

**Hecuba.**
Woe is me! I the mother of a dead man’s
slave! What custom, what ordinance is this amongst
Hellenes, good sir?

**Talthybius.**
Count thy daughter happy: ’tis well with
her.

**Hecuba.**
What wild words are these? say, is she still
alive?

**Talthybius.**
Her fate is one that sets her free from trouble.

**Hecuba.**
And what of mail-clad Hector’s wife, sad
Andromache? declare her fate.

**Talthybius.**
She too was a chosen prize; Achilles’ son did
take her.

**Hecuba.**
As for me whose hair is white with age, who
need to hold a staff to be to me a third foot, whose
servant am I to be?

**Talthybius.**
Odysseus, king of Ithaca, hath taken thee to
be his slave.

**Hecuba.**
O God! Now smite the close-shorn head!
Tear your cheeks with your nails. God help me!
I have fallen as a slave to a treacherous foe I hate,
A monster of lawlessness, one that by his double tongue
Hath turned against us all that once was friendly in his camp,
Changing this for that and that for this again.
Oh weep for me, ye Trojan dames! Undone!
Undone and lost! ah woe! a victim to a most unhappy lot!

**Chorus.**
Thy fate, royal mistress, now thou knowest;
But for me, what Hellene or Achaean
Is master of my destiny?

**Talthybius.**
Ho, servants! haste and bring Cassandra forth
to me here, that I may place her in our captain’s
hands, and then conduct to the rest of the chiefs
the captives each hath had assigned. Ha! what is the
blaze of torches there within? What do these Trojan
dames? Are they firing the chambers, because they
must leave this land and be carried away to Argos?
Are they setting themselves aflame in their longing
for death? Of a truth the free bear their troubles
in cases like this with a stiff neck. Ho, there! open!
lest their deed, which suits them well but finds small
favour with the Achaeans, bring blame on me.

**Hecuba.**
’Tis not that they are setting aught ablaze,
But my child Cassandra, frenzied maid,
Comes rushing wildly hither.

Enter Cassandra carrying torches.

**Cassandra.**
Bring the light, uplift and show its flame!
I am doing the god’s service, see! see!
Making his shrine to glow with tapers bright.
O Hymen, king of marriage! blest is the bridegroom;
Blest am I also, the maiden soon to wed a princely lord in Argos.
Hail Hymen, king of marriage!
Since thou, my mother, art ever busied with tears and lamentations
In thy mourning for my father’s death and for our country dear,
I at my own nuptials am making this torch to blaze and show its light,
In thy honour, O Hymen, king of marriage!
Grant thy light too, Hecate, at the maiden’s wedding, as the custom is.
Nimbly lift the foot aloft, lead on the dance, with cries of joy,
As if to greet my father’s happy fete.
To dance I hold a sacred duty; come, Phoebus, lead the way,
For ’tis in thy temple mid thy bay-trees that I minister.
Hail Hymen, god of marriage! Hymen, hail!
Come, mother mine, and join the dance, link thy steps with me,
And circle in the gladsome measure, now here, now there.
Salute the bride on her wedding-day with hymns and cries of joy.
Come, ye maids of Phrygia in raiment fair,
Sing my marriage with the husband fate ordains that I should wed.

**Chorus.**
Hold the frantic maiden, royal mistress mine,
Lest with nimble foot she rush to the Argive army.

**Hecuba.**
Thou god of fire, ’tis thine to light the bridal
torch for men, but piteous is the flame thou kindlest
here, beyond my blackest bodings. Ah, my child!
how little did I ever dream that such would be thy
marriage, a captive, and of Argos too! Give up the
torch to me; thou dost not bear its blaze aright in
thy wild frantic course, nor have thy afflictions left
thee in thy sober senses, but still art thou as frantic
as before. Take in those torches, Trojan friends, and
for her wedding madrigals weep your tears instead.

**Cassandra.**
O mother, crown my head with victor’s wreaths;
Rejoice in my royal match; lead me to my lord;
Nay, if thou find me loth at all, thrust me there by force;
For if Loxias be indeed a prophet,
Agamemnon, that famous king of the Achaeans,
Will find in me a bride more fraught with woe to him than Helen.
For I will slay him and lay waste his home
To avenge my father’s and my brethren’s death.
But of the deed itself I will not speak;
Nor will I tell of that axe which shall sever my neck
And the necks of others, or of the conflict ending in a mother’s death,
Which my marriage shall cause, nor of the overthrow of Atreus’ house;
But I, for all my frenzy, will so far rise above my frantic fit,
That I will prove this city happier far than those Achaeans,
Who for the sake of one woman and one man’s love of her
Have lost a countless host in seeking Helen.
Their captain too, whom men call wise,
Hath lost for what he hated most what most he prized,
Yielding to his brother for a woman’s sake—
And she a willing prize whom no man forced—
The joy he had of his own children in his home.
For from the day that they did land upon Scamander’s strand,
Their doom began, not for loss of stolen frontier
Nor yet for fatherland with frowning towers;
Whomso Ares slew, those never saw their babes again,
Nor were they shrouded for the tomb by hand of wife,
But in a foreign land they lie.
At home the case was still the same;
Wives were dying widows, parents were left childless in their homes,
Having reared their sons for others, and none is left
To make libations of blood upon the ground before their tombs.
Truly to such praise as this their host can make an ample claim.
’Tis better to pass their shame in silence by,
Nor be mine the Muse to tell that evil tale.
But the Trojans were dying, first for their fatherland,
Fairest fame to win; whomso the sword laid low,
All these found friends to bear their bodies home
And were laid to rest in the bosom of their native land,
Their funeral rites all duly paid by duteous hands.
And all such Phrygians as escaped the warrior’s death
Lived ever day by day with wife and children by them—
Joys the Achaeans had left behind.
As for Hector and his griefs, prithee hear how stands the case;
He is dead and gone, but still his fame remains
As bravest of the brave, and this was a result of the Achaeans’ coming;
For had they remained at home, his worth would have gone unnoticed.
So too with Paris, he married the daughter of Zeus,
Whereas, had he never done so, the alliance he made
In his family would have been forgotten.
Whoso is wise should fly from making war;
But if he be brought to this pass, a noble death
Will crown his city with glory, a coward’s end with shame.
Wherefore, mother mine, thou shouldst not pity thy country
Or my spousal, for this my marriage will destroy
Those whom thou and I most hate.

**Chorus.**
How sweetly at thy own sad lot thou smilest,
Chanting a strain, which, spite of thee, may prove thee wrong!

**Talthybius.**
Had not Apollo turned thy wits astray, thou
shouldst not for nothing have sent my chiefs with
such ominous predictions forth on their way. But,
after all, these lofty minds, reputed wise, are noth¬ing
better than those that are held as naught. For
that mighty king of all Hellas, own son of Atreus,
has yielded to a passion for this mad maiden of
all others; though I am poor enough, yet would I
ne’er have chosen such a wife as this. As for thee,
since thy senses are not whole, I give thy taunts
’gainst Argos and thy praise of Troy to the winds
to carry away. Follow me now to the ships to grace
the wedding of our chief. And thou too follow,
whensoe’er the son of Laertes demands thy presence,
for thou wilt serve a mistress most discreet, as all
declare who came to Ilium.

**Cassandra.**
A clever fellow this menial! Why is it heralds
Hold the name they do? All men unite in hating
With one common hate the servants who attend on kings or governments.
Thou sayest my mother shall come to the halls of Odysseus;
Where then be Apollo’s words, so clear to me in their interpretation,
Which declare that here she shall die?
What else remains, I will not taunt her with.
Little knows he, the luckless wight, the sufferings that await him;
Or how these ills I and my Phrygians endure
Shall one day seem to him precious as gold.
For beyond the ten long years spent at Troy
He shall drag out other ten and then come to his country all alone,
By the route where fell Charybdis lurks in a narrow channel ’twixt the rocks;
Past Cyclops the savage shepherd, and Ligurian Circe that turneth men to swine;
Shipwrecked oft upon the salt sea-wave;
Fain to eat the lotus, and the sacred cattle of the sun,
Whose flesh shall utter in the days to come a human voice,
Fraught with misery to Odysseus.
But to briefly end this history, he shall descend alive to Hades,
And, though he ’scape the waters’ flood,
Yet shall he find a thousand troubles in his home when he arrives.
Enough! why do I recount the troubles of Odysseus?
Lead on, that I forthwith may wed my husband for his home in Hades’ halls.
Base thou art, and basely shalt thou be buried,
In the dead of night when day is done,
Thou captain of that host of Danai,
Who thinkest so proudly of thy fortune!
Yea, and my corpse cast forth in nakedness
Shall the rocky chasm with its flood of wintry waters
Give to wild beasts to make their meal upon,
Hard by my husband’s tomb, me the handmaid of Apollo.
Farewell, ye garlands of that god most dear to me!
Farewell, ye mystic symbols! I here resign your feasts,
My joy in days gone by. Go, I tear ye from my body,
That, while yet mine honour is intact,
I may give them to the rushing winds to waft to thee,
My prince of prophecy! Where is yon general’s ship?
Whither must I go to take my place thereon?
Lose no further time in watching for a favouring breeze to fill thy sails,
Doomed as thou art to carry from this land one of the three avenging spirits.
Fare thee well, mother mine! dry thy tears, O country dear!
Yet a little while, my brothers sleeping in the tomb
And my own father true, and ye shall welcome me;
Yet shall victory crown my advent ’mongst the dead,
When I have overthrown the home of our destroyers,
The house of the sons of Atreus.

Exeunt Talthybius and Cassandra.

**Chorus.**
Ye guardians of the grey-haired Hecuba,
See how your mistress is sinking speechless to the ground!
Take hold of her! will ye let her fall, ye worthless slaves?
Lift up again, from where it lies, her silvered head.

**Hecuba.**
Leave me lying where I fell, my maidens—
Unwelcome service grows not welcome ever—
My sufferings now, my troubles past,
Afflictions yet to come, all claim this lowly posture.
Gods of heaven! small help I find in calling such allies,
Yet is there something in the form of invoking heaven,
Whenso we fall on evil days.
First will I descant upon my former blessings;
So shall I inspire the greater pity for my present woes.
Born to royal estate and wedded to a royal lord,
I was the mother of a race of gallant sons;
No mere ciphers they, but Phrygia’s chiefest pride,
Children such as no Trojan or Hellenic or barbarian mother ever had to boast.
All these have I seen slain by the spear of Hellas,
And at their tombs have I shorn off my hair;
With these my eyes I saw their sire, my Priam,
Butchered on his own hearth, and my city captured,
Nor did others bring this bitter news to me.
The maidens I brought up to see chosen for some marriage high,
For strangers have I reared them, and seen them snatched away.
Nevermore can I hope to be seen by them,
Nor shall my eyes behold them ever in the days to come.
And last, to crown my misery, shall I be brought to Hellas,
A slave in my old age. And there the tasks that least befit
The evening of my life will they impose on me,
To watch their gates and keep the keys, me Hector’s mother,
Or bake their bread, and on the ground instead of my royal bed
Lay down my shrunken limbs, with tattered rags about my wasted frame,
A shameful garb for those who once were prosperous.
Ah, woe is me! and this is what I bear and am to bear
For one weak woman’s wooing!
O my daughter, O Cassandra! whom gods have summoned to their frenzied train,
How cruel the lot that ends thy virgin days!
And thou, Polyxena! my child of sorrow, where, oh! where art thou?
None of all the many sons and daughters have I born
Comes to aid a wretched mother.
Why then raise me up? What hope is left us?
Guide me, who erst trod so daintily the streets of Troy,
But now am but a slave, to a bed upon the ground,
Nigh some rocky ridge, that thence I may cast me down and perish,
After I have wasted my body with weeping.
Of all the prosperous crowd, count none a happy man before he die.

**Chorus.**
Sing me, Muse, a tale of Troy, a funeral
Dirge in strains unheard as yet, with tears the while;
For now will I uplift for Troy a piteous chant,
Telling how I met my doom and fell a wretched captive to the Argives
By reason of a four-footed beast that moved on wheels,
In the hour that Achaea’s sons left at our gates that horse,
Loud rumbling on its way, with its trappings of gold and its freight of warriors;
And our folk cried out as they stood upon the rocky citadel,
“Up now ye whose toil is o’er, and drag this sacred image
To the shrine of the Zeus-born maiden, goddess of our Ilium!”
Forth from his house came every youth and every grey-head too;
And with songs of joy they took the fatal snare within.
Then hastened all the race of Phrygia to the gates,
To make the goddess a present of an Argive band
Ambushed in the polished mountain-pine, Dardania’s ruin,
A welcome gift to be to her, the virgin queen of deathless steeds;
And with nooses of cord they dragged it, as it had been a ship’s dark hull,
To the stone-built fane of the goddess Pallas,
And set it on that floor so soon to drink our country’s blood.
But, as they laboured and made merry, came on the pitchy night;
Loud the Libyan flute was sounding, and Phrygian songs awoke,
While maidens beat the ground with airy foot, uplifting their gladsome song;
And in the halls a blaze of torchlight shed its flickering shadows on sleeping eyes.
In that hour around the house was I singing as I danced
To that maiden of the hills, the child of Zeus;
When lo! there rang

along the town a cry of death which filled the homes
of Troy, and little babes in terror clung about their
mothers’ skirts, as forth from their ambush came
the warrior-band, the handiwork of maiden Pallas.
Anon the altars ran with Phrygian blood, and desolation
reigned o’er every bed where young men lay
beheaded, a glorious crown for Hellas won, ay, for
her, the nurse of youth, but for our Phrygian fatherland
a bitter grief. Look, Hecuba! dost see Andromache
advancing hither on a foreign car? and with
her, clasped to her throbbing breast, is her dear
Astyanax, Hector’s child.

*Enter Andromache.*

Hec. Whither art thou borne, unhappy wife,
mounted on that car, side by side with Hector’s
brazen arms and Phrygian spoils of war, with which
Achilles’ son will deck the shrines of Phthia on his
return from Troy?

An. My Achaean masters drag me hence.

Hec. Woe is thee!

An. Why dost thou in notes of woe utter the dirge
that is mine?

Hec. Ah me!

An. For these sorrows.

Hec. O Zeus!

An. And for this calamity.

Hec. O my children!

An. Our day is past.

Hec. Joy is fled, and Troy o’erthrown.

An. Woe is me!

Hec. Dead too all my gallant sons!

An. Alack and well-a-day!

Hec. Ah me for my—

An. Misery!

Hec. Piteous the fate—

An. Of our city,

Hec. Smouldering in the smoke.

An. Come, my husband, come to me!

Hec. Ah hapless wife! thou callest on my son who
lieth in the tomb.

An. Thy wife’s defender, come!

Hec. Do thou, who erst didst make the Achaeans
grieve, eldest of the sons I bare to Priam in the days
gone by, take me to thy rest in Hades’ halls!

An. Bitter are these regrets, unhappy mother,
bitter these woes to bear; our city ruined, and sorrow
evermore to sorrow added, through the will of
angry heaven, since the day that son^1 of thine escaped
his doom, he that for a bride accursed brought
destruction on the Trojan citadel. There lie the
gory corpses of the slain by the shrine of Pallas for
vultures to carry off; and Troy is come to slavery’s
yoke.

Hec. O my country, O unhappy land, I weep for
thee now left behind; now dost thou behold thy
piteous end; and thee, my house, I weep, wherein
I suffered travail. O my children! reft of her city
as your mother is, she now is losing you. Oh, what
mourning and what sorrow! oh, what endless streams
of tears in our houses! The dead alone forget their
griefs and never shed a tear.

Ch. What sweet relief to sufferers ’tis to weep, to
mourn, lament, and chant the dirge that tells of
grief!

An. Dost thou see this, mother of that Hector,
who once laid low in battle many a son of Argos?

Hec. I see that it is heaven’s way to exalt what
men accounted naught, and ruin what they most
esteemed.

An. Hence with my child as booty am I borne;
the noble are to slavery brought—a bitter, bitter
change.

Hec. This is necessity’s grim law; it was but now
Cassandra was torn with brutal violence from my
arms.

An. Alas, alas! it seems a second Aias hath appeared
to wrong thy daughter; but there be other ills for
thee.

Hec. Ay, beyond all count or measure are my
sorrows; evil vies with evil in the struggle to be first.

An. Thy daughter Polyxena is dead, slain at
Achilles’ tomb, an offering to his lifeless corpse.

Hec. O woe is me! This is that riddle Talthybius
long since told me, a truth obscurely uttered.

An. I saw her with mine eyes; so I alighted from
the chariot, and covered her corpse with a mantle,
and smote upon my breast.

Hec. Alas! my child, for thy unhallowed sacrifice!
and yet again, ah me! for this thy shameful
death!

An. Her death was even as it was, and yet that

### THE TROJAN WOMEN

death of hers was after all a happier fate than this
my life.

Hec. Death and life are not the same, my child;
the one is annihilation, the other keeps a place for
hope.

An. Hear, O mother of children! give ear to what
I urge so well, that I may cheer my drooping spirit.
’Tis all one, I say, ne’er to have been born and to be
dead, and better far is death than life with misery.
For the dead feel no sorrow any more and know no
grief; but he who has known prosperity and has
fallen on evil days feels his spirit straying from the
scene of former joys. Now that child of thine is dead
as though she ne’er had seen the light, and little she
recks of her calamity; whereas I, who aimed at a
fair repute, though I won a higher lot than most,
yet missed my luck in life. For all that stamps the
wife a woman chaste, I strove to do in Hector’s
home. In the first place, whether there is a slur upon
a woman, or whether there is not, the very fact of
her not staying at home brings in its train an evil
name; therefore I gave up any wish to do so, and
abode ever within my house, nor would I admit the
clever gossip women love, but conscious of a heart
that told an honest tale I was content therewith.
And ever would I keep a silent tongue and modest
eye before my lord; and well I knew where I might
rule my lord, and where ’twas best to yield to him;
the fame whereof hath reached the Achaean host,
and proved my ruin; for when I was taken captive,
Achilles’ son would have me as his wife, and I must
serve in the house of murderers. And if I set aside
my love for Hector, and ope my heart to this new
lord, I shall appear a traitress to the dead, while, if
I hate him, I shall incur my master’s displeasure.
And yet they say a single night removes a woman’s
dislike for her husband; nay, I do hate the woman
who, when she hath lost her former lord, transfers
her love by marrying another. Not e’en the horse,
if from his fellow torn, will cheerfully draw the
yoke; and yet the brutes have neither speech nor
sense to help them, and are by nature man’s inferiors.
O Hector mine! in thee I found a husband
amply dowered with wisdom, noble birth and fortune,
a brave man and a mighty; whilst thou didst
take me from my father’s house a spotless bride,
thyself the first to make this maiden wife. But now
death hath claimed thee, and I to Hellas am soon
to sail, a captive doomed to wear the yoke of slavery.
Hath not then the dead Polyxena, for whom thou
wailest, less evil to bear than I? I have not so much
as hope, the last resource of every human heart, nor
do I beguile myself with dreams of future bliss, the
very thought whereof is sweet.

Ch. Thou art in the self-same plight as I; thy
lamentations for thyself remind me of my own sad
case.

Hec. I never yet have set foot on a ship’s deck,
though I have seen such things in pictures and know
of them from hearsay. Now sailors, if there come a
storm of moderate force, are all eagerness to save
themselves by toil; one at the tiller stands, another

sets himself to work the sheets, a third meantime is
baling out the ship; but if tempestuous waves arise
to overwhelm them, they yield to fortune and commit
themselves to the driving billows. Even so I,
by reason of my countless troubles, am dumb and
forbear to say a word; for Heaven with its surge of
misery is too strong for me. Cease, Oh cease, my
darling child, to speak of Hector’s fate; no tears
of thine can save him; honour thy present lord,
offering thy sweet nature as the bait to win him. If
thou do this, thou wilt cheer thy friends as well as
thyself, and thou shalt rear my Hector’s child to
lend stout aid to Ilium, that so thy children in the
after-time may build her up again, and our city yet
be stablished. But lo! our talk must take a different
turn; who is this Achaean menial I see coming hither,
sent to tell us of some new design?

*Enter Talthybius.*

Ta. Oh hate me not, thou that erst wert Hector’s
wife, the bravest of the Phrygians! for my tongue
would fain not tell that which the Danai and sons
of Pelops both command.

An. What is it? Thy prelude bodeth evil
news.

Ta. ’Tis decreed thy son is—how can I tell my
news?

An. Surely not to have a different master from
me?

Ta. None of all Achaea’s chiefs shall ever lord it
over him.

An. Is it their will to leave him here, a remnant
yet of Phrygia’s race?

Ta. I know no words to break the sorrow lightly
to thee.

An. I thank thee for thy consideration, unless
indeed thou hast good news to tell.

Ta. They mean to slay thy son; there is my hateful
message to thee.

An. O God! this is worse tidings than my forced
marriage.

Ta. So spake Odysseus to the assembled Hellenes,
and his word prevails.

An. Oh once again ah me! there is no measure
in the woes I bear.

Ta. He said they should not rear so brave a father’s
son.

An. May such counsels yet prevail about children
of his!

Ta. From Troy’s battlements he must be thrown.
Let it be even so, and thou wilt show more wisdom;
cling not to him, but bear thy sorrows with heroic
heart, nor in thy weakness deem that thou art strong.
For nowhere hast thou any help; consider this thou
must; thy husband and thy city are no more, so
thou art in our power, and I alone am match enough
for one weak woman; wherefore I would not see
thee bent on strife, or any course to bring thee
shame or hate, nor would I hear thee rashly curse
the Achaeans. For if thou say aught whereat the
host grow wroth, this child will find no burial nor
pity either. But if thou hold thy peace and with
composure take thy fate, thou wilt not leave his

728-800

corpse unburied, and thyself wilt find more favour
with the Achaeans.

An. My child! my own sweet babe and priceless
treasure! thy death the foe demands, and thou must
leave thy wretched mother. That which saves the
lives of others, proves thy destruction, even thy
sire’s nobility; to thee thy father’s valiancy has
proved no boon. O the woeful wedding rites, that
brought me erst to Hector’s home, hoping to be the
mother of a son that should rule o’er Asia’s fruitful
fields instead of serving as a victim to the sons of
Danaus! Dost weep, my babe? dost know thy hapless
fate? Why clutch me with thy hands and to my
garment cling, nestling like a tender chick beneath
my wing? Hector will not rise again and come gripping
his famous spear to bring thee salvation; no
kinsman of thy sire appears, nor might of Phrygian
hosts; one awful headlong leap from the dizzy height
and thou wilt dash out thy life with none to pity
thee! Oh to clasp thy tender limbs, a mother’s fondest
joy! Oh to breathe thy fragrant breath! In vain
it seems these breasts did suckle thee, wrapped in
thy swaddling-clothes; all for naught I used to toil
and wore myself away! Kiss thy mother now for the
last time, nestle to her that bare thee, twine thy
arms about my neck and join thy lips to mine! O
ye Hellenes, cunning to devise new forms of cruelty,
why slay this child who never wronged any? Thou
daughter of Tyndarus, thou art no child of Zeus,
but sprung, I trow, of many a sire, first of some evil
demon, next of Envy, then of Murder and of Death,
and every horror that the earth begets. That Zeus was
never sire of thine I boldly do assert, bane as thou
hast been to many a Hellene and barbarian too.
Destruction catch thee! Those fair eyes of thine
have brought a shameful ruin on the fields of glorious
Troy. Take the babe and bear him hence, hurl
him down if so ye list, then feast upon his flesh!
’Tis heaven’s high will we perish, and I cannot ward
the deadly stroke from my child. Hide me and my
misery; cast me into the ship’s hold; for ’tis to a fair
wedding I am going, now that I have lost my child!

Ch. Unhappy Troy! thy thousands thou hast lost
for one woman’s sake and her accursed wooing.

Ta. Come, child, leave fond embracing of thy
woeful mother, and mount the high coronal of thy
ancestral towers, there to draw thy parting breath,
as is ordained. Take him hence. His should the duty
be to do such herald’s work, whose heart knows no
pity and who loveth ruthlessness more than my soul
doth.

*Exeunt Andromache and Talthybius with Astyanax.*

Hec. O child, son of my hapless boy, an unjust
fate robs me and thy mother of thy life. How is it
with me? What can I do for thee, my luckless babe?
for thee I smite upon my head and beat my breast,
my only gift; for that alone is in my power. Woe
for my city! woe for thee! Is not our cup full? What
is wanting now to our utter and immediate ruin?

Ch. O Telamon, King of Salamis, the feedingground
of bees, who hast thy home in a sea-girt isle

that lieth nigh the holy hills where first Athena
made the grey olive-branch to appear, a crown for
heavenly heads and a glory unto happy Athens,
thou didst come in knightly brotherhood with that
great archer, Alcmena’s son, to sack our city Ilium,
in days gone by, on thy advent from Hellas, what
time he led the chosen flower of Hellas, vexed for
the steeds denied him, and at the fair stream of
Simois he stayed his sea-borne ship and fastened
cables to the stern, and forth therefrom he took the
bow his hand could deftly shoot, to be the doom
of Laomedon; and with the ruddy breath of fire he
wasted the masonry squared by Phoebus’ line and
chisel, and sacked the land of Troy; so twice in two
attacks hath the bloodstained spear destroyed Dardania’s
walls.

In vain, it seems, thou Phrygian boy,^2 pacing with
dainty step amid thy golden chalices, dost thou fill
high the cup of Zeus, a service passing fair; seeing
that the land of thy birth is being consumed by fire.
The shore re-echoes to our cries; and, as a bird bewails
its young, so we bewail our husbands or our
children, or our grey-haired mothers. The dew-fed
springs where thou didst bathe, the course where
thou didst train, are now no more; but thou beside
the throne of Zeus art sitting with a calm, sweet
smile upon thy fair young face, while the spear of
Hellas lays the land of Priam waste. Ah! Love, Love,
who once didst seek these Dardan halls, deep-seated
in the hearts of heavenly gods, how high didst thou
make Troy to tower in those days, allying her with
deities! But I will cease to urge reproaches against
Zeus; for white-winged dawn, whose light to man
is dear, turned a baleful eye upon our land and
watched the ruin of our citadel, though she had
within her bridal bower a husband from this land,
whom on a day a car of gold and spangled stars
caught up and carried thither, great source of hope
to his native country; but all the love the gods once
had for Troy is passed away.

*Enter Menelaus.*

Menelaus. Hail! thou radiant orb by whose fair
light I now shall capture her that was my wife, even
Helen; for I am that Menelaus, who hath toiled so
hard, I and Achaea’s host. To Troy I came, not so
much as men suppose to take this woman, but to
punish him who from my house stole my wife, traitor
to my hospitality. But he, by heaven’s will, hath
paid the penalty, ruined, and his country too, by
the spear of Hellas. And I am come to bear that
Spartan woman hence—wife I have no mind to call
her, though she once was mine; for now she is but
one among the other Trojan dames who share these
tents as captives. For they—the very men who toiled
to take her with the spear—have granted her to me
to slay, or, if I will, to spare and carry back with me
to Argos. Now my purpose is not to put her to
death in Troy, but to carry her to Hellas in my seabourne
ship, and then surrender her to death, a recompense
to all whose friends were slain in Ilium.

277

880-935

Ho! my trusty men, enter the tent, and drag her
out to me by her hair with many a murder foul; and
when a favouring breeze shall blow, to Hellas will
we convey her.

Hec. O thou that dost support the earth and
restest thereupon, whosoe’er thou art, a riddle past
our ken! be thou Zeus, or natural necessity, or man’s
intellect, to thee I pray; for, though thou treadest
o’er a noiseless path, all thy dealings with mankind
are by justice guided.

Me. How now? Strange the prayer thou offerest
unto heaven!

Hec. I thank thee, Menelaus, if thou wilt slay
that wife of thine. Yet shun the sight of her, lest
she smite thee with regret. For she ensnares the
eyes of men, overthrows their towns, and burns their
houses, so potent are her witcheries! Well I know
her; so dost thou and those her victims too.

*Enter Helen.*

Helen. Menelaus! this prelude well may fill me
with alarm; for I am haled with violence by thy
servants’ hands and brought before these tents. Still,
though I am well-nigh sure thou hatest me, yet
would I fain inquire what thou and Hellas have decided
about my life.

Me. To judge thy case required no great exactness;
the host with one consent—that host whom
thou didst wrong—handed thee over to me to die.

Hel. May I answer this decision, proving that my
death, if to die I am, will be unjust?

Me. I came not to argue, but to slay thee.

Hec. Hear her, Menelaus; let her not die for want
of that, and let me answer her again, for thou knowest
naught of her villainies in Troy; and the whole
case, if thus summed up, will insure her death against
all chance of an escape.

Me. This boon needs leisure; still, if she wishes to
speak, the leave is given. Yet will I grant her this
because of thy words, that she may hear them, and
not for her own sake.

Hel. Perhaps thou wilt not answer me, from counting
me a foe, whether my words seem good or ill.
Yet will I put my charges and thine over against
each other, and then reply to the accusations I suppose
thou wilt advance against me. First, then, she
was the author of these troubles by giving birth to
Paris; next, old Priam ruined Troy and me, because
he did not slay his babe Alexander, baleful
semblance of a fire-brand, long ago. Hear what followed.
This Paris was to judge the claims of three
rival goddesses; so Pallas offered him command of
all the Phrygians, and the destruction of Hellas;
Hera promised he should spread his dominion over
Asia, and the utmost bounds of Europe, if he would
decide for her; but Cypris spoke in rapture of my
loveliness, and promised him this boon, if she should
have the preference o’er those twain for beauty;
now mark the inference I deduce from this; Cypris
won the day o’er them, and thus far hath my marriage
proved of benefit to Hellas, that ye are not
subject to barbarian rule, neither vanquished in the
strife, nor yet by tyrants crushed. What Hellas

### THE TROJAN WOMEN

^2 Ganymede.

935-991

gained, was ruin to me, a victim for my beauty sold,
and now am I reproached for that which should
have set a crown upon my head. But thou wilt say
I am silent on the real matter at issue, how it was
I started forth and left thy house by stealth. With
no mean goddess at his side he came, my evil genius,
call him Alexander or Paris, as thou wilt; and him
didst thou, thrice guilty wretch, leave behind thee
in thy house, and sail away from Sparta to the land
of Crete. Enough of this! For all that followed I
must question my own heart, not thee; what frantic
thought led me to follow the stranger from thy
house, traitress to my country and my home? Punish
the goddess, show thyself more mighty even than
Zeus, who, though he lords it o’er the other gods,
is yet her slave; wherefore I may well be pardoned.
Still, from hence thou mightest draw a specious
argument against me; when Paris died, and Earth
concealed his corpse, I should have left his house
and sought the Argive fleet, since my marriage was
no longer in the hands of gods. That was what I fain
had done; yea, and the warders on the towers and
watchmen on the walls can bear me witness, for oft
they found me seeking to let myself down stealthily
by cords from the battlements; but there was
that new husband, Deiphobus, that carried me off
by force to be his wife against the will of Troy. How
then, my lord, could I be justly put to death by
thee, with any show of right, seeing that he wedded
me against my will, and those my other natural gifts
have served a bitter slavery, instead of leading on
to triumph? If ’tis thy will indeed to master gods,
that very wish displays thy folly.

Ch. O my royal mistress, defend thy children’s
and thy country’s cause, bringing to naught her
persuasive arguments, for she pleads well in spite of
all her villainy; ’tis monstrous this!

Hec. First will I take up the cause of those goddesses,
and prove how she perverts the truth. For I
can ne’er believe that Hera or the maiden Pallas
would have been guilty of such folly, as to sell, the
one, her Argos to barbarians, or that Pallas e’er
would make her Athens subject to the Phrygians,
coming as they did in mere wanton sport to Ida to
contest the palm of beauty. For why should goddess
Hera set her heart so much on such a prize? Was it
to win a nobler lord than Zeus? or was Athena bent
on finding ’mongst the gods a husband, she who in
her dislike of marriage won from her sire the boon
of remaining unwed? Seek not to impute folly to
the goddesses, in the attempt to gloze o’er thy own
sin; never wilt thou persuade the wise. Next thou
hast said—what well may make men jeer—that
Cypris came with my son to the house of Menelaus.
Could she not have stayed quietly in heaven and
brought thee and *Amyclae* to boot to Ilium? Nay!
my son was passing fair, and when thou sawest him
thy fancy straight became thy Cypris; for every
sensual act that men commit, they lay upon this
goddess, and rightly does her name of *Aphrodite*
begin the word for “senselessness”; so when thou
didst catch sight of him in gorgeous foreign garb,

### EURIPIDES

992-1048

ablaze with gold, thy senses utterly forsook thee.
Yea, for in Argos thou hadst moved in simple state,
but, once free of Sparta, ’twas thy fond hope to
deluge by thy lavish outlay Phrygia’s town, that
flowed with gold; nor was the palace of Menelaus
rich enough for thy luxury to riot in. Ha! my son
carried thee off by force, so thou sayest; what Spartan
saw this? what cry for help didst thou ever
raise, though Castor was still alive, a vigorous youth,
and his brother also, not yet amid the stars? Then
when thou wert come to Troy, and the Argives
were on thy track, and the mortal combat was begun,
whenever tidings came to thee of Menelaus’
prowess, him wouldst thou praise, to grieve my son,
because he had so powerful a rival in his love; but
if so the Trojans prospered, Menelaus was nothing
to thee. Thy eye was fixed on Fortune, and by such
practice wert thou careful to follow in her steps,
careless of virtue’s cause. And then, in spite of all,
thou dost assert that thou didst try to let thyself
down from the towers by stealth with twisted cords,
as if loth to stay? Pray then, wert thou ever found
fastening the noose about thy neck, or whetting the
knife, as a noble wife would have done in regret for
her former husband? And yet full oft I advised thee
saying, “Get thee gone, daughter, and let my sons
take other brides; I will help thee to steal away, and
convey thee to the Achaean fleet; oh end the strife
’twixt us and Hellas!” But this was bitter in thy
ears. For thou wert wantoning in Alexander’s house,
fain to have obeisance done thee by barbarians. Yes,
’twas a proud time for thee; and now after all this
thou hast bedizened thyself, and come forth and
hast dared to appear under the same sky as thy
husband, revolting wretch! Better hadst thou come
in tattered raiment, cowering humbly in terror,
with hair shorn short, if for thy past sins thy feeling
were one of shame rather than effrontery. O Menelaus,
hear the conclusion of my argument; crown
Hellas by slaying her as she deserves, and establish
this law for all others of her sex, even death to every
traitress to her husband.

Ch. Avenge thee, Menelaus, on thy wife, as is
worthy of thy home and ancestors, clear thyself
from the reproach of effeminacy at the lips of Hellas,
and let thy foes see thy spirit.

Me. Thy thoughts with mine do coincide, that
she, without constraint, left my palace, and sought
a stranger’s love, and now Cypris is introduced for
mere bluster. Away to those who shall stone thee,
and by thy speedy death requite the weary toils of
the Achaeans, that thou mayst learn not to bring
shame on me!

Hel. Oh, by thy knees, I implore thee, impute
not that heaven-sent affliction to me, nor slay me;
pardon, I entreat!

Hec. Be not false to thy allies, whose death this
woman caused; on their behalf, and for my children’s
sake, I sue to thee.

Me. Peace, reverend dame; to her I pay no heed.
Lo! I bid my servants take her hence, aboard the
ship, wherein she is to sail.

278

1048-1122

Hec. Oh never let her set foot within the same
ship as thee.

Me. How now? is she heavier than of yore?

Hec. Who loveth once, must love alway.

Me. Why, that depends how those we love are
minded. But thy wish shall be granted; she shall
not set foot upon the same ship with me; for thy
advice is surely sound; and when she comes to Argos
she shall die a shameful death as is her due, and impress
the need of chastity on all her sex; no easy
task; yet shall her fate strike their foolish hearts
with terror, even though they be more lost to shame
than she.

*Exit Menelaus, dragging Helen with him.*

Ch. So then thou hast delivered into Achaea’s
hand, O Zeus, thy shrine in Ilium and thy fragrant
altar, the offerings of burnt sacrifice with smoke of
myrrh to heaven uprising, and holy Pergamos, and
glens of Ida tangled with ivy’s growth, where rills
of melting snow pour down their flood, a holy sunlit
land that bounds the world and takes the god’s
first rays! Gone are thy sacrifices! gone the dancer’s
cheerful shout! gone the vigils of the gods as night
closed in! Thy images of carven gold are now no
more; and Phrygia’s holy festivals, twelve times a
year, at each full moon, are ended now. ’Tis this
that filleth me with anxious thought whether thou,
O king, seated on the sky, thy heavenly throne,
carest at all that my city is destroyed, a prey to the
furious fiery blast. Ah! my husband, fondly loved,
thou art a wandering spectre; unwashed, unburied
lies thy corpse, while o’er the sea the ship sped by
wings will carry me to Argos, land of steeds, where
stand Cyclopian walls of stone upreared to heaven.
There in the gate the children gather, hanging round
their mothers’ necks, and weep their piteous lamentation,
“O mother, woe is me! torn from thy sight
Achaeans bear me away from thee to their dark ship
to row me o’er the deep to sacred Salamis or to the
hill^3 on the Isthmus, that o’erlooks two seas, the key
to the gates of Pelops.” Oh may the blazing thunderbolt,
hurled in might from its holy home, smite the
barque of Menelaus full amidships as it is crossing
the Aegean main, since he is carrying me away in

_Enter TALTHYBIUS and attendants, bearing the corpse of ASTYANAX on HECTOR’S shield._

**Talthybius:** Hecuba, one ship alone delays its plashing
oars, and it is soon to sail to the shores of Phthia
freighted with the remnant of the spoils of Achilles’
son; for Neoptolemus is already out at sea, having
heard that new calamities have befallen Peleus, for
Acastus, son of Pelias, hath banished him the realm.
Wherefore he is gone, too quick to indulge in any
delay, and with him goes Andromache, who drew
many a tear from me what time she started hence,
wailing her country and crying her farewell to Hec-
tor’s tomb. And she craved her master leave to bury
this poor dead child of Hector who breathed his
last when from the turrets hurled, entreating too
that he would not carry this shield, the terror of the
Achaeans — this shield with plates of brass wherewith
his father would gird himself — to the home of Peleus
or to the same bridal bower whither she, herself the
mother of this corpse, would be led, a bitter sight
to her, but let her bury the child therein instead of
in a coffin of cedar or a tomb of stone, and to thy
hands commit the corpse, that thou mayst deck it
with robes and garlands as best thou canst with thy
present means; for she is far away and her master’s
haste prevented her from burying the child herself.
So we, when thou hast decked the corpse, will heap
the earth above and set thereon a spear; but do thou
with thy best speed perform thy allotted task; one
toil, however, have I already spared thee, for I crossed
Scamander’s stream and bathed the corpse and
cleansed its wounds. But now will I go to dig a grave
for him, that our united efforts shortening our task
may speed our ship towards home.

_Exit TALTHYBIUS._

**Hecuba:** Place the shield upon the ground, Hector’s
shield so deftly rounded, a piteous sight, a bitter
grief for me to see. O ye Achaeans, more reason have
ye to boast of your prowess than of your wisdom! Why
have ye in terror of this child been guilty of a murder
never matched before? Did ye fear that some day
he would rear again the fallen walls of Troy? It
seems then ye were nothing after all, when, though
Hector’s fortunes in the war were prosperous and
he had ten thousand other arms to back him, we
still were daily overmatched; and yet, now that our
city is taken and every Phrygian slain, ye fear a
tender babe like this! Out upon his fear, say I, who
fears but never yet hath reasoned out the cause.
Ah! my beloved, thine is a piteous death indeed!
Hadst thou died for thy city, when thou hadst tasted
of the sweets of manhood, of marriage, and of god-
like power o’er others, then wert thou blest, if aught
herein is blest. But now after one glimpse, one dream
thereof thou knowest them no more, my child, and
hast no joy of them, though heir to all. Ah, poor
babe! how sadly have thy own father’s walls, those
towers that Loxias reared, shorn from thy head the
locks thy mother fondled, and so oft caressed, from
which, through fractured bones, the face of murder
grins — briefly to dismiss my shocking theme. O
hands, how sweet the likeness ye retain of his father,

_1232-1288_

and yet ye lie limp in your sockets before me! Dear
mouth, so often full of words of pride, death hath
closed thee, and thou hast not kept the promise
thou didst make, when nestling in my robe, “Ah,
mother mine, many a lock of my hair will I cut off
for thee, and to thy tomb will lead my troops of
friends, taking a fond farewell of thee.” But now
’tis not thy hand that buries me, but I, on whom is
come old age with loss of home and children, am
burying thee, a tender child untimely slain. Ah me!
those kisses numberless, the nurture that I gave to
thee, those sleepless nights — they all are lost! What
shall the bard inscribe upon thy tomb about thee?
“Argives once for fear of him slew this child!” Foul
shame should that inscription be to Hellas. O child,
though thou hast no part in all thy father’s wealth,
yet shalt thou have his brazen shield wherein to
find a tomb. Ah! shield that didst keep safe the
comely arm of Hector, now hast thou lost thy vali-
ant keeper! How fair upon thy handle lies his imprint,
and on the rim, that circles round the targe, are
marks of sweat, that trickled oft from Hector’s brow
as he pressed it ’gainst his beard in battle’s stress.
Come, bring forth, from such store as we have,
adornment for the hapless dead, for fortune gives
no chance now for offerings fair; yet of such as I
possess, shalt thou receive these gifts. Foolish mortal
he! who thinks his luck secure and so rejoices; for
fortune, like a madman in her moods, springs to-
wards this man, then towards that; and none ever
experiences the same unchanging luck.

**Chorus:** Lo! all is ready and they are bringing at thy
bidding from the spoils of Troy garniture to put
upon the dead.

**Hecuba:** Ah! my child, ’tis not as victor o’er thy
comrades with horse or bow — customs Troy esteems,
without pursuing them to excess — that Hector’s
mother decks thee now with ornaments from the
store that once was thine, though now hath Helen,
whom the gods abhor, reft thee of thine own, yea,
and robbed thee of thy life and caused thy house to
perish root and branch.

**Chorus:** Woe! thrice woe! my heart is touched, and
thou the cause, my mighty prince in days now passed!

**Hecuba:** About thy body now I swathe this Phrygian
robe of honour, which should have clad thee on thy
marriage-day, wedded to the noblest of Asia’s daugh-
ters. Thou too, dear shield of Hector, victorious
parent of countless triumphs past, accept thy
crown, for though thou share the dead child’s tomb,
death cannot touch thee; for thou dost merit hon-
ours far beyond those arms^1 that the crafty knave
Odysseus won.

^1. The arms of Achilles.

**Chorus:** Alas! ah me! thee, O child, shall earth take
to her breast, a cause for bitter weeping. Mourn,
thou mother!

**Hecuba:** Ah me!

**Chorus:** Wail for the dead.

**Hecuba:** Woe is me!

**Chorus:** Alas! for thy unending sorrow!

**Hecuba:** Thy wounds in part will I bind up with band-
ages, a wretched leech in name alone, without real-
ity; but for the rest, thy sire must look to that
amongst the dead.

**Chorus:** Smite, oh smite upon thy head with frequent
blow of hand. Woe is me!

**Hecuba:** My kind, good friends!

**Chorus:** Speak out, Hecuba, the word that was on
thy lips.

**Hecuba:** It seems the only things that heaven con-
cerns itself about are my troubles and Troy hateful
in their eyes above all other cities. In vain did we
sacrifice to them. Had not the god caught us in his
grip and plunged us headlong ’neath the earth, we
should have been unheard of, nor ever sung in Muses’
songs, furnishing to bards of after-days a subject for
their minstrelsy. Go, bury now in his poor tomb the
dead, wreathed all duly as befits a corpse. And yet I
deem it makes but little difference to the dead, al-
though they get a gorgeous funeral; for this is but
a cause of idle pride to the living.

_The corpse is carried off to burial._

**Chorus:** Alas! for thy unhappy mother, who o’er thy
corpse hath closed the high hopes of her life! Born
of a noble stock, counted most happy in thy lot, ah!
what a tragic death is thine! Ha! who are those I see
on yonder pinnacles darting to and fro with flaming
torches in their hands? Some new calamity will soon
on Troy alight.

_Enter TALTHYBIUS above. Soldiers are seen on the battlements of Troy, torch in hand._

**Talthybius:** Ye captains, whose allotted task it is to fire
this town of Priam, to you I speak. No longer keep
the firebrand idle in your hands, but launch the
flame, that when we have destroyed the city of
Ilium we may set forth in gladness on our home-
ward voyage from Troy. And you, ye sons of Troy
— to let my orders take at once a double form —
start for the Achaean ships for your departure hence,
soon as ever the leaders of the host blow loud and
clear upon the trumpet. And thou, unhappy grey-
haired dame, follow; for yonder come servants from
Odysseus to fetch thee, for to him thou art assigned
by lot to be a slave far from thy country.

**Hecuba:** Ah, woe is me! This surely is the last, the
utmost limit this, of all my sorrows; forth from my
land I go; my city is ablaze with flame. Yet, thou
aged foot, make one painful struggle to hasten, that
I may say a farewell to this wretched town. O Troy,
that erst hadst such a grand career amongst bar-
barian towns, soon wilt thou be reft of that splendid
name. Lo! they are burning thee, and leading us
e’en now from our land to slavery. Great gods! Yet
why call on the gods? They did not hearken e’en
aforetime to our call. Come, let us rush into the
flames, for to die with my country in its blazing
ruin were a noble death for me.

**Talthybius:** Thy sorrows drive thee frantic, poor lady.
Go, lead her hence, make no delay, for ye must
deliver her into the hand of Odysseus, conveying
to him his prize.

**Hecuba:** O son of Cronos, prince of Phrygia, father

_1289-1314_

of our race, dost thou behold our sufferings now,
unworthy of the stock of Dardanus?

**Chorus:** He sees them, but our mighty city is a city
no more, and Troy’s day is done.

**Hecuba:** Woe! thrice woe upon me! Ilium is ablaze;
the homes of Pergamus and its towering walls are
now one sheet of flame.

**Chorus:** As the smoke soars on wings to heaven, so
sinks our city to the ground before the spear. With
furious haste both fire and foeman’s spear devour
each house.

**Hecuba:** Hearken, my children, hear your mother’s
voice.

**Chorus:** Thou art calling on the dead with voice of
lamentation.

**Hecuba:** Yea, as I stretch my aged limbs upon the
ground, and beat upon the earth with both my hands.

**Chorus:** I follow thee and kneel, invoking from the
nether world my hapless husband.

**Hecuba:** I am being dragged and hurried away —

**Chorus:** O the sorrow of that cry!

**Hecuba:** From my own dear country, to dwell be-
neath a master’s roof. Woe is me! O Priam, Priam,
slain, unburied, left without a friend, naught dost
thou know of my cruel fate.

_1315-1333_

**Chorus:** No, for o’er his eyes black death hath drawn
his pall — a holy man by sinners slain!

**Hecuba:** Woe for the temples of the gods! Woe for
our dear city!

**Chorus:** Woe!

**Hecuba:** Murderous flame and foeman’s spear are now
your lot.

**Chorus:** Soon will ye tumble to your own loved soil,
and be forgotten.

**Hecuba:** And the dust, mounting to heaven on wings
like smoke, will rob me of the sight of my home.

**Chorus:** The name of my country will pass into ob-
scurity; all is scattered far and wide, and hapless
Troy has ceased to be.

**Hecuba:** Did ye hear that and know its purport?

**Chorus:** Aye, ’twas the crash of the citadel.

**Hecuba:** The shock will whelm our city utterly. O
woe is me! Trembling, quaking limbs, support my
footsteps! Away! to face the day that begins thy
slavery.

**Chorus:** Woe for our unhappy town! And yet to the
Achaean fleet advance.

**Hecuba:** Woe for thee, O land that nursed my little
babes!

**Chorus:** Ah! woe!

_Exeunt omnes._
