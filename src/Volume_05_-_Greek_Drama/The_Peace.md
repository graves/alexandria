The scene represents the exterior of the house of *Trygaeus*, two of whose servants are visible in the foreground, ministering to the wants of an enormous dung-beetle, which is confined in one of the outer courts, the walls of the court being sufficiently high to conceal its inmate from the audience.

1st Servant.
Bring, bring the beetle cake;
quick there, quick! quick!

2nd Servant.
Here!

1st Servant.
Give it him, the abominable brute.

2nd Servant.
O may he never taste a daintier morsel!

1st Servant.
Now bring another, shaped from asses’ dung.

2nd Servant.
Here, here again.

1st Servant.
Where’s that you brought just now?
He can’t have eaten it.

2nd Servant.
No; he trundled it
With his two feet, and bolted it entire.

1st Servant.
Quick, quick, and beat up several, firm and tight.

2nd Servant.
O help me, scavengers, by all the Gods!
Or I shall choke and die before your eyes.

1st Servant.
Another cake, a boy-companion’s bring him:
He wants one finelier moulded.

2nd Servant.
Here it is.
There’s one advantage in this work, my masters:
No man will say I pick my dishes now.

1st Servant.
Pah! more, bring more, another and another;
Keep kneading more.

2nd Servant.
By *Apollo*, no, not I!
I can’t endure this muck a moment longer;
I’ll take and pitch the muck-tub in and all.

1st Servant.
Aye to the crows, and follow it yourself.

2nd Servant.
Can any one of you, I wonder, tell me
Where I can buy a nose not perforated?
There’s no more loathly miserable task
Than to be mashing dung to feed a beetle.
A pig or dog will take its bit of muck
Just as it falls: but this conceited brute
Gives himself airs, and, bless you, he won’t touch it
Unless I mash it all day long, and serve it
As for a lady, in a rich round cake.
Now I’ll peep in and see if he has done,
Holding the door, thus, that he mayn’t observe me.
Aye, tuck away; go gobbling on, don’t stop;
I hope you’ll burst yourself before you know it.
Wretch! how he throws himself upon his food,
Squared like a wrestler, grappling with his jaws,
Twisting his head and hands, now here, now there,
For all the world like men who plait and weave
Those great thick ropes to tow the barges with.
’Tis a most stinking, foul, voracious brute.
Nor can I tell whose appanage he is:
I really think he can’t be *Aphrodite’s*,
Nor yet the *Graces’*.

1st Servant.
No? then whose?

2nd Servant.
I take it
This is the sign of sulphur-bolting *Zeus*.
Now I suspect some pert young witling there
Is asking, “Well, but what’s it all about?
What can the beetle mean?” And then I think
That some *Ionian*, sitting by, will answer,
“Now, I’ve nae doubt but this is aimed at *Cleon*,
It eats the muck sae unco shamelessly.”
But I will in, and give the beetle drink.

1st Servant.
And I will tell the story to the boys,
And to the lads, and also to the men,
And to the great and mighty men among you,
And to the greatest mightiest men of all.
My master’s mad; a novel kind of madness,
Not your old style, but quite a new invention.
For all day long he gazes at the sky,
His mouth wide open, thus; and rails at *Zeus*:
“O *Zeus*,” says he, “what seekest thou to do?
Lay down thy besom, sweep not *Hellas* bare!”

Trygaeus. (behind the scenes)
Ah me! Ah me!

2nd Servant.
Hush! for methinks I hear him speaking now.

Trygaeus. (behind the scenes)
O *Zeus*,
What wouldest thou with our people? Thou wilt drain
The lifeblood from our cities ere thou knowest!

2nd Servant.
Aye, there it is; that’s just what I was saying:
Ye hear yourselves a sample of his ravings.
But what he did when first the frenzy seized him
I’ll tell you; he kept muttering to himself,
“Oh if I could but somehow get to *Zeus*!”
With that he got thin scaling ladders made,
And tried by them to scramble up to heaven,
Till he came tumbling down, and cracked his skull.
Then yesterday he stole I know not whither,
And brought a huge *Aetnaean* beetle home,
And made me groom it, while he coaxed it down
Like a young favourite colt, and kept on saying,
“Wee *Pegasus*, my flying thoroughbred,
Your wings must waft me straight away to *Zeus*!”
Now I’ll peep in and see what he’s about.
Oh, mercy on us! neighbours! neighbours! help!
My master’s got astride upon the beetle,
And up they go ascending in the air.

*Enter Trygaeus on a great dung-beetle with wings spread.*

Trygaeus.
Fair and softly, my beastlet, at first.
Start not at once with a violent burst,
In the proud delight of your eager might,
Ere your joints with sweat are relaxed and wet
From the powerful swing of your stalwart wing.
And breathe not strong as we soar along;
If you can’t refrain, you had best remain
Down here in the stalls of your master’s halls.

2nd Servant.
O master of me! why, how mad you must be!

Trygaeus.
Keep silence! keep silence!

2nd Servant.
Why, where do you try so inanely to fly?

Trygaeus.
My flight for the sake of all *Hellas* I take,
A novel and daring adventure preparing.

2nd Servant.
Why can’t you remain at home, and be sane?

Trygaeus.
O let not a word of ill omen be heard,
But greet me with blessings and cheers as I go,
And order mankind to be silent below;
And please to be sure with bricks to secure
All places receptive of dung and manure.

2nd Servant.
No, no; I won’t keep still, unless you tell me
Whither you’re flying off.

Trygaeus.
Whither, except
To visit *Zeus* in heaven?

1st Servant.
Whatever for?

Trygaeus.
I’m going to ask him what he is going to do
About the *Hellenic* peoples, one and all.

1st Servant.
And if he won’t inform you?

Trygaeus.
I’ll indict him
As giving *Hellas* over to the *Medes*.

2nd Servant. (struggling with *Trygaeus*)
Not while I live, so help me *Dionysus*!

Trygaeus.
There is no way but this.

2nd Servant.
Here! children! here!
Quick! quick! your father’s stealing off to heaven,
Leaving you here deserted and forlorn.
Speak to him, plead with him, you ill-starred maidens.

*Enter the daughters of Trygaeus.*

Daughter.
O father, O father, and can it be true
The tale that is come to our ears about you,
That along with the birds you are going to go,
And to leave us alone and be off to the crow?
Is it a fact, O my father?
O tell me the truth if you love me.

Trygaeus.
Yes, it appears so, my children:
in truth, I am sorry to see you
Calling me dearest papa,
and asking me bread for your dinner,
When I have got in the house
not an atom of silver to buy it;
But if I ever return with success
ye shall soon be enjoying
Buns of enormous size,
with strong fist-sauce to improve them.

Daughter.
And what’s to be the method of your passage?
Ships will not do: they cannot go this journey.

Trygaeus.
I ride a steed with wings: no ships for me.

Daughter.
But what’s the wit of harnessing a beetle
To ride on it to heaven, papa, papa?

Trygaeus.
It is the only living thing with wings,
So *Aesop* says, that ever reached the Gods.

Daughter.
O father, father, that’s too good a story
That such a stinking brute should enter heaven!

Trygaeus.
It went to take revenge upon the eagle,
And break her eggs, a many years ago.

Daughter.
But should you not have harnessed *Pegasus*,
And so, in tragic style, approach the Gods?

Trygaeus.
Nay, then I must have had supplies for two;
But now the very food I eat myself,
All this will presently be food for him.

Daughter.
What if he fall in wintry watery waves,
How will his wings help extricate him then?

Trygaeus.
Oh, I’ve a rudder all prepared for that:
My ship’s a beetle-sloop, of *Naxian* make.

Daughter.
What bay will land you drifting, drifting on?

Trygaeus.
Why, in *Peiraeus*, there’s the Beetle Bay.

Daughter.
Yet, O be careful lest you tumble off,
And (lame for life) afford *Euripides*
A subject, and become a tragic hero.

Trygaeus.
I’ll see to that: goodbye, goodbye, my dears!
But you, for whom I toil and labour so,
Do for three days resist the calls of nature;
Since, if my beetle in the air should smell it,
He’ll toss me headlong off, and turn to graze.
Up, up, my *Pegasus*, merrily, cheerily,
With ears complacent, while blithe and bold
Your curbs shake out their clatter of gold.
(I wonder what in the world he means
By pointing his nose at those foul latrines.)
Rise, gallantly rise, from the earth to the skies,
And on with the beat of your pinion fleet
Till you come to *Zeus* in his heavenly seat.
From all your earthly supplies of dirt,
From ordure and muck your nostril avert.
Man! man in *Peiraeus*! you’ll kill me I swear,
Committing a nuisance! good fellow, forbear;
Dig it down in the ground, scatter perfumes around,
Heap, heap up the earth on the top,
Plant sweet-smelling thyme to encircle the mound,
Bring myrrh on its summit to drop;
For if I through your folly shall tumble today,
And my enterprise fail to succeed in,
Five talents the city of *Chios* shall pay
On account of your breach of good-breeding.

*The scene suddenly changes.*
*Trygaeus* has been in the air supported by some sort of crane, but now some sort of platform is pushed forward, with the Palace of *Zeus* for its background, and on this *Trygaeus* dismounts.

Trygaeus.
Zounds! how you scared me: I’m not joking now.
I say, scene-shifter, have a care of me.
You gave me quite a turn; and if you don’t
Take care, I’m certain I shall feed my beetle.
But now, methinks, we must be near the Gods;
And sure enough there stand the halls of *Zeus*.
Oh, open! open! who’s in waiting here?

Hermes. (within)
A breath of man steals o’er me: whence, whence comes it? (Opens door.)
O *Heracles*, what’s this?

Trygaeus.
A beetle-horse.

Hermes.
O shameless miscreant, vagabond, and rogue,
O miscreant, utter miscreant, worst of miscreants,
How came you here, you worst of all the miscreants?
Your name? what is it? speak!

Trygaeus.
The worst of miscreants.

Hermes.
Your race? your country? answer!

Trygaeus.
Worst of miscreants.

Hermes.
And who’s your father?

Trygaeus.
Mine? the worst of miscreants.

Hermes.
O by the Earth but you shall die the death
Unless you tell me who and what you are.

Trygaeus.
*Trygaeus*, an *Athmonian*, skilled in vines;
No sycophant, no lover of disputes.

Hermes.
Why are you come?

Trygaeus.
To offer you this meat.

Hermes.
How did you get here, Wheedling?

Trygaeus.
Oho, Greedling!
Then I’m not quite the worst of miscreants now.
So just step in and summon *Zeus*.

Hermes.
Oho!
When you’re not likely to come near the Gods!
They’re gone: they left these quarters yesterday.

Trygaeus.
Where on Earth are they?

Hermes.
Earth, indeed!

Trygaeus.
But where?

Hermes.
Far, far away, close to Heaven’s highest dome.

Trygaeus.
How came they then to leave you here alone?

Hermes.
I have to watch the little things they left,
Pipkins and pannikins and trencherlets.

Trygaeus.
And what’s the reason that they went away?

Hermes.
They were so vexed with *Hellas*: therefore here
Where they were dwelling, they’ve established *War*,
And given you up entirely to his will.
But they themselves have settled up aloft,
As high as they can go; that they no more
May see your fightings or receive your prayers.

Trygaeus.
Why have they treated us like that? Do tell me.

Hermes.
Because, though They were oftentimes for *Peace*,
You always would have *War*. If the *Laconians*
Achieved some slight advantage, they would say,
“Noo by the *Twa*[^1] sail master *Attic* catch it”;
Or if the *Attics* had their turn of luck,
And the *Laconians* came to treat for peace,
At once ye cried, “We’re being taken in,
*Athene*! *Zeus*! we can’t consent to this;
They’re sure to come again if we keep *Pylus*.”

Trygaeus.
Yes; that’s exactly how we talked: exactly.

Hermes.
So that I know not if ye e’er again
Will see the face of *Peace*.

Trygaeus.
Why, where’s she gone to?

Hermes.
*War* has immured her in a deep deep pit.

Trygaeus.
Where?

Hermes.
Here, beneath our feet. And you may see
The heavy stones he piled about its mouth,
That none should take her out.

Trygaeus.
I wish you’d tell me
How he proposes now to deal with us.

Hermes.
I only know that yester eve he brought
Into this house a most gigantic mortar.

Trygaeus.
What is he going to do with that, I wonder!

Hermes.
He means to put the cities in and pound them.
But I shall go. He’s making such a din
I think he’s coming out. *Exit.*

Trygaeus.
Shoo! let me run
Out of his way: methought that I myself
Heard a great mortar’s war-inspiring blast.

*Enter War, bearing a gigantic mortar, in which he is about to mix a salad.*

War.
O mortals! mortals! wondrous-woeful mortals!
How ye will suffer in your jaws directly!

Trygaeus.
O King *Apollo*, what a great big mortar!
Oh the mere look of *War* how bad it is!
Is this the actual *War* from whom we flee,
The dread tough *War*, the *War* upon the legs?

War. (throwing in leeks)
O *Prasiae*! O thrice wretched, five times wretched,
And tens of times, how you’ll be crushed today!

Trygaeus.
Friends, this as yet is no concern of ours,
This is a blow for the *Laconian* side.

War. (throwing in garlic)
O *Megara*! *Megara*! in another moment,
How you’ll be worn, and torn, and ground to salad!

Trygaeus.
Good gracious! O what heavy, bitter tears
He has thrown in to mix for *Megara*.

War. (throwing in cheese)
O *Sicily*! and you’ll be ruined too.

Trygaeus.
Ah, how that hapless state will soon be grated!

War.
And now I’ll pour some *Attic* honey in.

Trygaeus.
Hey, there, I warn you, use some other honey:
Be sparing of the *Attic*; that costs sixpence.

War.
Ho, boy! boy! *Riot*!

Riot. (entering)
What’s your will?

War.
You’ll catch it,
You rascal, standing idle there! take that!

Riot.
Ugh, how it stings. O me! O me! why, master,
Sure you’ve not primed your knuckles with the garlic?

War.
Run in and get a pestle.

Riot.
We’ve not got one;
We only moved in yesterday, you know.

War.
Then run at once and borrow one from *Athens*.

Riot.
I’ll run by *Zeus*; or else I’m sure to catch it. *Exit.*

Trygaeus.
What’s to be done, my poor dear mortals, now?
Just see how terrible our danger is:
For if that varlet bring a pestle back,
*War* will sit down and pulverize our cities.
Heavens! may he perish, and not bring one back.

Riot.
You there!

War.
What! Don’t you bring it?

Riot.
Just look here, sir:
The pestle the *Athenians* had is lost,
The tanner fellow that disturbed all *Hellas*.

Trygaeus.
O well done he, *Athene*, mighty mistress;
Well is he lost, and for the state’s advantage,
Before they’ve mixed us up this bitter salad.

War.
Then run away and fetch from *Lacedaemon*
Another pestle.

Riot.
Yes, sir.

War.
Don’t be long.

Trygaeus.
Now is the crisis of our fate, my friends.
And if there’s here a man initiate
In *Samothrace*, ’tis now the hour to pray
For the averting of—the varlet’s feet.

Riot.
Alas! alas! and yet again, alas!

War.
What ails you? Don’t you bring one now?

Riot.
O Sir,
The *Spartans* too have lost their pestle now.

War.
How so, you rascal?

Riot.
Why, they lent it out
To friends up *Thraceward*, and they lost it there.

Trygaeus.
And well done they! well done! Twin sons of *Zeus*!
Take courage, mortals: all may yet be well.

War.
Pick up the things, and carry them away;
I’ll go within and make myself a pestle.

*Exeunt War and Riot.*

Trygaeus.
Now may I sing the ode that *Datis*[^2] made,
The ode he sang in ecstasy at noon,
“Eh, sirs, I’m pleased, and joyed, and comforted.”
Now, men of *Hellas*, now the hour has come
To throw away our troubles and our wars,
And, ere another pestle rise to stop us,
To pull out *Peace*, the joy of all mankind.
O all ye farmers, merchants, artisans,
O all ye craftsmen, aliens, sojourners,
O all ye islanders, O all ye peoples,
Come with ropes, and spades, and crowbars,
come in eager hurrying haste,
Now the cup of happy fortune,
brothers, it is ours to taste.

*Enter Chorus of Laborers.*

Chorus.
Come then, heart and soul, my comrades,
haste to win this great salvation,
Now or never, now if ever,
come, the whole *Hellenic* nation!
Throw away your ranks and squadrons,
throw your scarlet plagues away,
Lo, at length the day is dawning,
*Lamachus*-detesting day!
O be thou our guide and leader,
managing, presiding o’er us,
For I think I shan’t give over
in this noble task before us,
Till with levers, cranes, and pulleys
once again to light we haul
*Peace*, the Goddess best and greatest,
vineyard-lovingest of all.

Trygaeus.
O be quiet! O be quiet! by your noisy loud delight
You will waken *War*, the demon,
who is crouching out of sight.

Chorus.
O we joy, we joy, we joy, to
hear your glorious proclamations,
So unlike that odious “Wanted
at the camp with three days’ rations.”

Trygaeus.
Yet beware, beware, remember!
*Cerberus* is down below:
He may come with fuss and fury
(as when he was here you know),
Every obstacle and hindrance
in the way of *Peace* to throw.

Chorus.
Who shall bear her, who shall tear her,
from these loving arms away,
If I once can clasp and grasp her?
O hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

Trygaeus.
Zounds! you’ll surely be our ruin:
stop your clamour, I entreat:
*War* will by and by come trampling
everything beneath his feet.

Chorus.
Let him stamp, and tramp, and trample,
let him do whate’er he will,
I am so immensely happy that I really can’t be still.

Trygaeus.
What the mischief! what’s the matter?
Do not, by the Gods, I pray,
With your dancings and your prancings
spoil our noble work today.

Chorus.
Really now I didn’t mean to: no I didn’t, I declare:
Quite without my will my ankles
will perform this joyous air.

Trygaeus.
Well, but don’t go on at present;
cease your dancing or you’ll rue it.

Chorus.
Look, observe, I’ve really ceased it.

Trygaeus.
So you say, but still you do it.

Chorus.
Only once, I do beseech you;
only just a single hop.

Trygaeus.
Well then, one: make haste about it;
only one, and then you stop.

Chorus.
Stop? Of course we stop with pleasure
if ’twill your designs assist.

Trygaeus.
Well, but look: you’re still proceeding.

Chorus.
Just, by *Zeus*, one other twist
Let me fling my right leg upwards,
and I’ll really then refrain.

Trygaeus.
This indulgence too I’ll grant you,
so you don’t offend again.

Chorus.
Hah! but here’s my left leg also:
it must have its turn, ’tis plain.
(dancing vigorously with both legs)
I’m so happy, glad, delighted,
getting rid of arms at last,
More than if, my youth renewing,
I the slough of Age had cast.

Trygaeus.
Well, but don’t exult at present,
for we’re all uncertain still,
But, when once we come to hold her,
then be merry if you will;
Then will be the time for laughing,
Shouting out in jovial glee,
Sailing, sleeping, feasting, quaffing,
All the public sights to see.
Then the *Cottabus* be playing,
Then be hip-hip-hip-hurrahing,
Pass the day and pass the night
Like a regular *Sybarite*.

Chorus.
O that it were yet my fortune
those delightful days to see!
Woes enough I’ve had to bear,
Sorry pallets, trouble, care,
Such as fell to *Phormio’s* share,
I would never more thereafter
so morose and bitter be,
Nor a judge so stubborn-hearted,
unrelenting, and severe;
You shall find me yielding then,
Quite a tender youth again,
When these weary times depart.
Long enough we’ve undergone
Toils and sorrows many a one,
Worn and spent and sick at heart,
From *Lyceum*, to *Lyceum*,
trudging on with shield and spear.
Now then tell us what you would
Have us do, and we’ll obey,
Since by fortune fair and good
You’re our sovereign Lord today.

Trygaeus.
Come let me see which way to move the stones.

*Re-enter Hermes.*

Hermes.
Rogue! miscreant! what are you up to now?

Trygaeus.
No harm;
Everything’s right, as *Cillicon* observed.

Hermes.
Wretch! you shall die!

Trygaeus.
When it’s my lot, of course,
For being *Hermes* you’ll use lots, I know.

Hermes.
O you are doomed! doomed! doomed!

Trygaeus.
Yes? For what day?

Hermes.
This very instant.

Trygaeus.
But I’m not prepared:
I’ve bought no bread and cheese, as if to die.

Hermes.
Ah, well, you’re absolutely gone!

Trygaeus.
That’s odd,
To get such famous luck and yet not know it.

Hermes.
Then don’t you know that death’s denounced by *Zeus*
On all found digging here?

Trygaeus.
And is it so?
And must I die indeed?

Hermes.
You must indeed.

Trygaeus.
O then, I prithee, lend me half a crown.
I’ll buy a pig, and get initiate first.

Hermes.
Ho! *Zeus*! *Zeus*! thunder-crasher!

Trygaeus.
O pray don’t.
O by the heavenly powers, don’t peach upon us.

Hermes.
No, no, I won’t keep silence.

Trygaeus.
O pray do.
O by the heavenly meat I brought you, master.
Don’t stand gaping there, my comrades;
are ye quite deprived of speech?
What’s the matter? Speak, ye rascals!
if you don’t, he’s safe to peach.

Chorus.
Do not, do not, mighty *Hermes*,
do not, do not shout, I pray,
If you e’er have tasted swine,
Tasted sucking-pigs of mine,
Which have soothed your throat divine,
Think upon it, think upon it,
nor despise the deed today.

Trygaeus.
King and master, won’t you listen
to the coaxing words they say?

Chorus.
View us not with wrathful eye,
Nor our humble prayers deny,
From this dungeon let us hand her.
O if you indeed detest,
And abhor the sweeping crest
And the eyebrows of *Peisander*,
Let us now, O God most gracious!
let us carry *Peace* away.
Then we’ll glad processions bring,
Then with sacrifices due,
We will always, lord and king,
We will always honour you.

Trygaeus.
O sir, be pitiful, and heed their cry:
They never showed you such respect as now.

Hermes.
Why, no; they never were such thieves as now.

Trygaeus.
And then I’ll tell you a tremendous secret,
A horrid dreadful plot against the Gods.

Hermes.
Well, tell away: I’m open to conviction.

Trygaeus.
’Tis that the Moon and vile immoral Sun
Have long been plotting to your hurt: and now
They’re giving *Hellas* up to the *Barbarians*.

Hermes.
Why are they doing that?

Trygaeus.
Because, by *Zeus*!
We sacrifice to you, but those *Barbarians*
Only to them. So naturally they
Are very anxious that we all should perish,
And they get all the rites of all the Gods.

Hermes.
Then that’s the reason why they clipped the days,
And nibbled off their rounds, misguiding sinners.

Trygaeus.
It is, it is: Come, *Hermes*, lend a hand,
Help us to pull her out. And then for you
We’ll celebrate the great *Panathenaea*,
And all the other rites of all the Gods,
*Demeter*, *Zeus*, *Adonis*, all for you;
And everywhere the cities saved from woe
Will sacrifice to you, the Saviour *Hermes*.
Much, much besides you’ll gain: and first of all
I give you this (producing a gold cup),
a vessel for libations.

Hermes.
Fie! how I soften at the sight of gold!
There, my men, the work’s before you!
I’ve got nothing more to say.
Quick, take up your spades, and enter,
shovelling all the stones away.

Chorus.
Gladly, gladly will we do it,
wisest of the Gods; and you,
Like a skilled superior craftsman,
teach us what we ought to do.
I warrant, when the way we know,
you’ll find us anything but slow.

Trygaeus.
Hold out the vessel, and we’ll launch the work
With free libations and with holy prayers.

Hermes.
Pour libations.
Silence! silence! pour libations.

Trygaeus.
And as we pour we’ll pray. O happy morn,
Be thou the source of every joy to *Hellas*!
And O may he who labours well today
Be never forced to bear a shield again!

Chorus.
No; may he spend his happy days in peace,
Stirring the fire, his mistress at his side.

Trygaeus.
If there be any that delights in war,
King *Dionysus*, may he never cease
Picking out spearheads from his funny-bones.

Chorus.
If any, seeking to be made a Captain,
Hates to see *Peace* return, O may he ever
Fare in his battles like *Cleonymus*.

Trygaeus.
If any merchant, selling spears or shields,
Would fain have battles, to improve his trade,
May he be seized by thieves and eat raw barley.

Chorus.
If any would-be General won’t assist us,
Or any slave preparing to desert,
May he be flogged, and broken on the wheel.
But on ourselves all joy: hip, hip, hurrah!

Trygaeus.
Don’t talk of being hipped: Hurrah’s the word.

Chorus.
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah’s the word today.

Trygaeus. (pouring libations)
To *Hermes*, Love, Desire, the Hours, and *Graces*.

Chorus.
Not *Ares*?

Trygaeus. (with disgust)
No!

Chorus.
Nor *Enyalius*?

Trygaeus.
No.

Chorus.
Now all set to, and labour at the ropes.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Chorus.
Pull away a little stronger.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Chorus.
Keep it up a little longer.

Hermes.
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

Trygaeus.
Ah they don’t pull all alike.
Cease your craning: ’tis but feigning:
Pull, *Boeotians*! or I’ll strike.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Trygaeus.
Pull away, away, away.

Chorus. (to *Trygaeus* and *Hermes*)
Verily you should be helping us too.

Trygaeus. (indignantly)
Don’t I strain, might and main,
Cling and swing, tug and haul?

Chorus.
Yet we don’t advance at all.

Trygaeus.
Now don’t sit there and thwart us, *Lamachus*.
We don’t require your *Bugaboo*[^3], my man.

Hermes.
These *Argives*, too, they give no help at all.
They only laugh at us, our toils and troubles,
And all the while take pay from either side.

Trygaeus.
But the *Laconians*, comrade, pull like men.

Hermes.
Ah, mark, ’tis only such as work in wood
That fain would help us: but the smith impedes.

Trygaeus.
And the *Megarians* do no good: they pull, though,
Scrabbling away like ravenous puppy dogs.
Good lack! they’re regularly starved and ruined.

Chorus.
We make no way, my comrades: we must try
A strong pull, and a long pull, all together.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Trygaeus.
Keep it up a little longer.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Trygaeus.
Yes, by *Zeus*! a little stronger.

Chorus.
Very slow, now we go.

Trygaeus.
What a shameful dirty trick!
Some are working, others shirking,
*Argives*, ye shall feel the stick.

Hermes.
Yo ho! pull away.

Trygaeus.
Pull away, away, away.

Chorus.
Some of you still are designing us ill.

Trygaeus.
Ye who fain *Peace* would gain,
Pull and strain, might and main.

Chorus.
Some one’s hindering us again.

Hermes.
Plague take you, men of *Megara*; get out!
The Goddess hates you: she remembers well
’Twas you that primed her up at first with garlic.
Stop, stop, *Athenians*: shift your hold a little;
It’s no use pulling as you’re now disposed.
You don’t do anything but go to law.
No, if you really want to pull her out,
Stand back a trifle further towards the sea.

Chorus.
Come, let us farmers pull alone,
and set our shoulders to it.

Hermes.
Upon my word you’re gaining ground:
I think you’re going to do it.

Chorus.
He says we’re really gaining ground:
cheer up, cheer up, my hearty.

Trygaeus.
The farmers have it all themselves,
and not another party.

Chorus.
Pull again, pull, my men,
Now we’re gaining fast.
Never slacken, put your back in,
Here she comes at last.
Pull, pull, pull, pull, every man, all he can;
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull,
Pull, pull, pull, pull, all together.

*Peace* is lifted out with her two attendants, *Harvest-Home* and *Mayfair*.

Trygaeus.
Giver of grapes, O how shall I address you?

[^1]: The *Dioscuri*.
[^2]: Persian commander at *Marathon* and noted for his blunders in Greek. Thus, the verb endings of l. 291.
[^3]: The *Gorgon* shield of *Lamachus*, one of the *Athenian* generals in the *Sicilian* expedition.

# THE PEACE

O for a word ten thousand buckets big  
Wherewith to accost you: for I’ve none at hand.  
Good morning, Harvesthome: good morn, Mayfair.  
O what a lovely charming face, Mayfair!

(Kisses her)

O what a breath! how fragrant to my heart,  
How sweet, how soft, with perfume and inaction.

He. Not quite the odour of a knapsack, eh?

Tr. Faugh! that odious pouch of odious men, I hate it.

It has a smell of rancid-onion whiffs;  
But she of harvests, banquets, festivals,  
Flutes, thrushes, plays, the odes of Sophocles,  
Euripidean wordlets,

He. O how dare you  
Slander her so: I’m sure she does not like  
That logic-monger’s wordy disputations.

Tr. (continuing) The bleating lambs, the ivy-leaf, the vat,  
Full-bosomed matrons hurrying to the farm,  
The tipsy maid, the drained and emptied flask,  
And many another blessing.

He. And look there,  
See how the reconciled cities greet and blend  
In peaceful intercourse, and laugh for joy;  
And that, too, though their eyes are swoln and blackened,  
And all cling fast to cupping instruments.

Tr. Yes, and survey the audience: by their looks  
You can discern their trades.

He. O dear! O dear!  
Don’t you observe the man that makes the crests  
Tearing his hair? and yon’s a pitchfork-seller;  
Fie! how he fillips the sword-cutler there.

Tr. And see how pleased that sickle-maker looks,  
Joking and poking the spear-burnisher.

He. Now then give notice: let the farmers go.

Tr. O yes! O yes! the farmers all may go  
Back to their homes, farm-implements and all.  
You can leave your darts behind you:  
Yea, for sword and spear shall cease.  
All things all around are teeming  
with the mellow gifts of Peace;  
Shout your Paeans, march away  
to labour in your fields to-day.

Ch. Day most welcome to the farmers  
and to all the just and true,  
Now I see you I am eager  
once again my vines to view,  
And the fig-trees which I planted  
in my boyhood’s early prime,  
I would fain salute and visit  
after such a weary time.

Tr. First, then, comrades, to the Goddess  
be our grateful prayers addressed,  
Who has freed us from the Gorgons  
and the fear-inspiring crest.  
Next a little salt provision fit for country uses buy,  
Then with merry expedition  
homeward to the fields we’ll hie.

He. O Poseidon! fair their order,  
sweet their serried ranks to see:  
Right and tight, like rounded biscuits,  
or a thronged festivity.

Tr. Yes, by Zeus! the well-armed mattock  
seems to sparkle as we gaze,  
And the burnished pitchforks glitter  
in the sun’s delighted rays.  
Very famously with those  
will they clear the vineyard rows.  
So that I myself am eager  
homeward to my farm to go,

Breaking up the little furrows  
(long-neglected) with the hoe.  
Think of all the thousand pleasures,  
Comrades, which to Peace we owe,  
All the life of ease and comfort  
Which she gave us long ago:  
Figs and olives, wine and myrtles,  
Luscious fruits preserved and dried,  
Banks of fragrant violets, blowing  
By the crystal fountain’s side;  
Scenes for which our hearts are yearning,  
Joys that we have missed so long —  
— Comrades, here is Peace returning,  
Greet her back with dance and song!

Ch. Welcome, welcome, best and dearest,  
welcome, welcome, welcome, home.  
We have looked and longed for thee,  
Looking, longing, wondrously,  
Once again our farms to see.  
O the joy, the bliss, the rapture,  
really to behold thee come.  
Thou wast aye our chief enjoyment,  
thou wast aye our greatest gain.  
We who ply the farmer’s trade  
Used, through thy benignant aid,  
All the joys of life to hold.

Ah! the unbought pleasures free  
Which we erst received of thee  
In the merry days of old,  
When thou wast our one salvation  
and our roasted barley grain.  
Now will all the tiny shoots,  
Sunny vine and fig-tree sweet,  
All the happy flowers and fruits,  
Laugh for joy thy steps to greet.

Ah, but where has Peace been hiding  
all these long and weary hours?  
Hermes, teach us all the story,  
kindest of the heavenly Powers.

He. O most sapient worthy farmers,  
listen now and understand,  
If you fain would learn the reason,  
why it was she left the land.  
Pheidias began the mischief,  
having come to grief and shame,  
Pericles was next in order,  
fearing he might share the blame,  
Dreading much your hasty temper,  
and your savage bulldog ways,  
So before misfortune reached him,  
he contrived a flame to raise,  
By his Megara-enactment[^1]  
setting all the world ablaze.  
Such a bitter smoke ascended  
while the flames of war he blew,  
That from every eye in Hellas  
everywhere the tears it drew.  
Wailed the vine, and rent its branches,  
when the evil news it heard;  
Butt on butt was dashed and shivered,  
by revenge and anger stirred;  
There was none to stay the tumult;  
Peace in silence disappeared.

Tr. By Apollo I had never  
heard these simple facts narrated,  
No, nor knew she was so closely  
to our Pheidias related.

Ch. No, nor I, till just this moment:  
that is why she looks so fair.  
Goodness me! how many things  
escape our notice I declare.

He. Then when once the subject cities,  
over whom ye bare the sway,  
Saw you at each other snarling,  
growling angrier day by day,  
To escape the contributions,  
every willing nerve they strained,  
And the chief Laconian leaders  
by enormous bribes they gained.  
These at once for filthy lucre,  
guest-deluders as they are,  
Hustling out this gracious lady,  
greedily embraced the War.  
But from this their own advantage  
ruin to their farmers came;  
For from hence the eager galleys  
sailing forth with vengeful aim,  
Swallowed up the figs of people  
who were not, perchance, to blame.

Tr. Very justly, very justly!  
richly had they earned the blow,  
Lopping down the dusky fig-tree  
I had loved and nurtured so.

Ch. Very justly, very justly!  
since my great capacious bin,  
Ugh! the rascals came across it,  
took a stone, and stove it in.

He. Then your labouring population,  
flocking in from vale and plain,  
Never dreamed that, like the others,  
they themselves were sold for gain,  
But as having lost their grape-stones,  
and desiring figs to get,  
Every one his rapt attention  
on the public speakers set;  
These beheld you poor and famished,  
lacking all your home supplies,  
Straight they pitchforked out the Goddess,  
scouting her with yells and cries,  
Whensoe’er (for much she loved you)  
back she turned with wistful eyes.  
Then with suits they vexed and harassed  
your substantial rich allies,  
Whispering in your ear, “The fellow  
leans to Brasidas,” and you  
Like a pack of hounds in chorus  
on the quivering victim flew.  
Yea, the City, sick and pallid,  
shivering with disease and fright,  
Any calumny they cast her,  
ate with ravenous appetite.

Till at last your friends perceiving  
whence their heavy wounds arose,  
Stopped with gold the mouths of speakers  
who were such disastrous foes.  
Thus the scoundrels throve and prospered:  
whilst distracted Hellas came  
Unobserved to wrack and ruin:  
but the fellow most to blame  
Was a tanner.

Tr. Softly, softly, Hermes master, say not so;  
Let the man remain in silence, wheresoe’er he is, below;  
For the man is ours no longer: he is all your own, you know;  
Therefore whatsoe’er you call him,  
Knave and slave while yet amongst us,  
Wrangler, jangler, false accuser,  
Troubler, muddler, all-confuser,  
You will all these names be calling  
One who now is yours alone.

(to Peace)  
But tell me, lady, why you stand so mute.

He. Oh, she won’t speak one word before this audience:  
No, no; they’ve wronged her far too much for that.

Tr. Then won’t she whisper, all alone, to you?

He. Will you, my dearest, speak your thoughts to me?  
Come, of all ladies most shield-handle-hating.

(affects to listen.)

Yes, good; that’s their offence: I understand.  
Listen, spectators, why she blames you so.

She says that after that affair in Pylus  
She came, unbidden, with a chest of treaties,  
And thrice you blackballed her in full assembly.

Tr. We erred in that; but, lady, pardon us,  
For then our wits were swaddled up in skins.

He. Well then, attend to what she asks me now.  
Who in your city loves her least? and who  
Loves her the best and shrinks from fighting most?

Tr. Cleonymus, I think, by far the most.

He. What sort of man is this Cleonymus  
In military matters?

Tr. Excellent:  
Only he’s not his so-called father’s son;  
For if he goes to battle, in a trice  
He proves himself a castaway—of shields.

He. Still further listen what she asks me now.  
Who is it now that sways the Assembly-stone?

Tr. Hyperbolus at present holds the place.  
But how now, Mistress? Why avert your eyes?

He. She turns away in anger from the people,  
For taking to itself so vile a leader.

Tr. He’s a mere makeshift: we’ll not use him now.  
’Twas that the people, bare and stripped of leaders,  
Just caught him up to gird itself withal.

He. She asks how this can benefit the state.

Tr. ’Twill make our counsels brighter.

He. Will it? how?

Tr. Because he deals in lamps: before he came  
We all were groping in the dark, but now  
His lamps may give our council-board some light.

He. Oh! oh!  
What things she wants to know!

Tr. What sort of things?

He. All the old things existing when she left.  
And first, she asks if Sophocles be well.

Tr. He’s well, but strangely metamorphosed.

He. How?

Tr. He’s now Simonides, not Sophocles.

He. What do you mean?

Tr. He’s grown so old and sordid,  
He’d put to sea upon a sieve for money.

He. Lives the old wit Cratinus?

Tr. No; he perished  
When the Laconians made their raid.

He. How so?

Tr. Swooned dead away: he could not bear to see  
A jolly butt of wine all smashed and wasted.  
Much, much beside we’ve suffered; wherefore, lady,  
We’ll never never let you go again.

He. Then on these terms I’ll give you Harvesthome  
To be your bride and partner in your fields.  
Take her to wife, and propagate young vines.

Tr. O Harvesthome! come here and let me kiss you.  
But, Hermes, won’t it hurt me if I make  
Too free with fruits of Harvesthome at first?

He. Not if you add a dose of pennyroyal.  
But, since you’re going, please to take Mayfair  
Back to the Council, whose of old she was.

Tr. O happy Council to possess Mayfair!  
O what a three-days’ carnival you’ll have!  
What soup! what tripe! what delicate tender meat!  
But fare thee well, dear Hermes.

He. And do you—  
Farewell, dear mortal, and remember me.

Tr. Home, home, my beetle! let us now fly home.

He. Your beetle’s gone, my friend.

Tr. Why, where’s he gone to?

He. Yoked to the car of Zeus, he bears the thunder.

Tr. What will he get to eat, poor creature, there?

He. Why, Ganymede’s ambrosia, to be sure.

Tr. And how shall I get down?

He. O well enough.  
There, by the side of Peace.

Tr. Now girls, now girls,  
Keep close to me: our youngsters I well know  
Are sore all over for the love of you.

Exeunt Trygaeus with Harvesthome and Mayfair.

Chorus

Yes, go, and good fortune escort you, my friend;  
meanwhile the machines and the wraps,  
We’ll give to our faithful attendants to guard,  
for a number of dissolute chaps  
Are sure to be lurking about on the stage,  
to pilfer and plunder and steal;

Here, take them and watch them and keep them with care,  
while we to the audience reveal  
The mind of our Play, and whatever we may  
By our native acumen be prompted to say.

'Twere proper and right for the Ushers to smite,  
if ever a bard, we confess,  
Were to fill with the praise of himself and his plays  
our own anapaestic address.  
But if ever, O daughter of Zeus, it were fit  
with honour and praise to adorn  
A Chorus-Instructor, the ablest of men,  
the noblest that ever was born,  
Our Poet is free to acknowledge that he  
is deserving of high commendation:  
It was he that advancing, unaided, alone,  
compelled the immediate cessation  
Of the jokes which his rivals were cutting at rags,  
and the battles they waged with the lice.  
It was he that indignantly swept from the stage  
the paltry ignoble device  
Of a Heracles needy and seedy and greedy,  
a vagabond sturdy and stout,  
Now baking his bread, now swindling instead,  
now beaten and battered about.  
And freedom he gave to the lachrymose slave  
who was wont with a howl to rush in,  
And all for the sake of a joke which they make  
on the wounds that disfigure his skin:  
“Why, how now, my poor knave?” so they bawl to the slave,  
“has the whipcord invaded your back,  
Spreading havoc around, hacking trees to the ground,  
with a savage resistless attack?”  
Such vulgar contemptible lumber at once  
he bade from the drama depart,  
And then, like an edifice stately and grand,  
he raised and ennobled the Art.  
High thoughts and high language he brought on the stage,  
a humour exalted and rare,  
Nor stooped with a scurrilous jest to assail  
some small-man-and-woman affair.  
No, he at the mightiest quarry of all  
with the soul of a Heracles flew,  
And he braved the vile scent of the tan-pit, and went  
through foul-mouthed revilings for you.  
And I at the outset came down in the lists  
with the jagged-fanged monster to fight,  
Whose eyeballs were lurid and glaring with flames  
of Cynna’s detestable light;  
And around his forehead the thin forked tongues  
of a hundred sycophants quiver,  
And his smell was the smell of a seal, and his voice  
was a brawling tempestuous River,  
And his hinder parts like a furnace appeared,  
and a goblin’s uncleansable liver.  
But I recked not the least for the look of the beast;  
I never desponded or quailed,  
And I fought for the safety of you and the Isles;  
I gallantly fought and prevailed.  
You therefore should heed and remember the deed,  
and afford me my guerdon to-day,  
For I never went off to make love to the boys  
in the schools of athletic display  
Heretofore when I gained the theatrical prize:  
but I packed up my traps and departed,  
Having caused you great joy and but little annoy,  
and mightily pleased the true-hearted.

It is right then for all, young and old, great and small,  
Henceforth of my side and my party to be,  
And each bald-headed man should do all that he can  
That the prize be awarded to me.

For be sure if this play be triumphant to-day,  
That whene’er you recline at the feast or the wine,  
Your neighbour will say,  
“Give this to the bald-head, give that to the bald-head,  
And take not away  
That sweetmeat, that cake, but present and bestow it  
On the man with the brow of our wonderful Poet!”

Muse having driven afar this terrible business of war,  
Join with Me the chorus.  
Come singing of Nuptials divine and earthly banquets,  
Singing the joys of the blessed: this of old to Thee belongs.  
But and if Carcinus coming  
Ask thee to join with his sons in choral dances,  
Hearken not, come not, stand not  
As an ally beside them,  
Think of them all as merely  
Little domestical quails, ballet-dancers with wallet necks,  
Nipped from the droppings of goats, small, stunted, machinery-hunters.

Yea, for their father declared that the drama which  
Passed all his hopes, in the evening  
By the cat was strangled.

These are the songs of the fair sweet Graces with beautiful hair,  
Which it well beseemeth  
This poet of wisdom to chant, while softly resting  
Warbles the swallow of spring; and Morsimus no chorus gains,  
No, nor Melanthius either.

Well I remember his shrill discordant chatter,  
When the tragedians’ chorus  
He and his brother tutored,  
Both of them being merely  
Gorgons, devourers of sweets, skate-worshippers, and harpies,  
Pests of old maids, rank fetid as goats, destroyers of fishes.

Thou having spit on them largely and heavily,  
Join in the festival dances,  
Heavenly Muse, beside me.

Enter Trygaeus, Harvesthome, and Mayfair.

Tr. O what a job it was to reach the Gods!  
I know I’m right fatigued in both my legs.  
How small ye seemed down here! why from above  
Methought ye looked as bad as bad could be,  
But here ye look considerably worse.

Enter 1st Servant.

1st S. What, master, you returned!

Tr. So I’m informed.

1st S. What have you got?

Tr. Got? pains in both my legs.  
Faith! it’s a rare long way.

1st S. Nay, tell me,

Tr. What?

1st S. Did you see any wandering in the air  
Besides yourself?

Tr. No; nothing much to speak of,  
Two or three souls of dithyrambic poets.

1st S. What were they after?

Tr. Flitting round for odes,  
Those floating-on-high-in-the-airy-sky affairs.

1st S. Then ’tisn’t true what people say about it,  
That when we die, we straightway turn to stars?

Tr. O yes it is.

1st S. And who’s the star there now?

Tr. Ion of Chios, who on earth composed  
“Star o’ the Morn,” and when he came there, all  
At once saluted him as “Star o’ the Morn.”

1st S. And did you learn about those falling stars  
Which sparkle as they run?

Tr. Yes, those are some  
Of the rich stars returning home from supper,  
Lanterns in hand, and in the lanterns fire.

But take this girl at once, and lead her in;  
Deluge the bath, and make the water warm;  
Then spread the nuptial couch for her and me:  
And when you’ve finished, hither come again.  
Meanwhile I’ll give this other to the Council.

1st S. Whence have you brought these maidens?

Tr. Whence? from heaven.

1st S. I wouldn’t give three halfpence for the Gods  
If they keep brothels as we mortals do.

Tr. No, no; yet even there some live by these.

1st S. Come on then, mistress: tell me, must I give her  
Nothing to eat?

Tr. O no, she will not touch  
Our wheat and barley bread: her wont has been  
To lap ambrosia with the Gods in heaven.

1st S. Lap! we’ll prepare her lap then here on earth.

(Exeunt servant and Harvesthome.)

Ch. O what a lucky old man!  
Truly the whole of your plan  
Prospers as well as it can.

Tr. I really wonder what you’ll say  
when I’m a bridegroom spruce and gay.

Ch. All men will gaze with delight.  
Old as you are you’ll be quite  
Youthful and perfumed and bright.

Tr. What, when you see her tender waist  
by these encircling arms embraced?

Ch. Why then we’ll think you happier far  
than Carcinus’s twistlings are.

Tr. And justly too, methinks, for I  
On beetleback essayed to fly,  
And rescued Hellas, worn with strife,  
And stored your life  
With pleasant joys of home and wife,  
With country mirth and leisure.

Re-enter servant.

1st S. Well, sir, the girl has bathed and looks divinely:  
They mix the puddings, and they’ve made the cakes;  
Everything’s done: we only want the husband.

Tr. Come then and let us give Mayfair at once  
Up to the Council.

1st S. What do you say? Mayfair!  
Is this May Fair? the Fair we kept at Brauron,  
When we were fresh and mellow, years ago?

Tr. Aye, and ’twas work enough to catch her.

1st S. O!  
How neat her pasterns, quite a five-year-old.

Tr. (looking round upon the audience)  
Now, have you any there that I can trust?  
One who will lead her safely to the Council?

(to the servant) What are you scribbling?

1st S. Marking out a place  
To pitch my tent in, at the Isthmian games.

Tr. Well, is there none can take her? come to me then;  
I’ll go myself, and set you down amongst them.

1st S. Here’s some one making signs.

Tr. Who is it?

1st S. Who! Ariphrades: he wants her brought his way.

Tr. No: I can’t bear his dirty, sloppy way;  
So come to me, and lay those parcels down.

(Leads her forward.)

Councillors! Magistrates! behold Mayfair!  
And O remember what a deal of fun  
That word implies: what pastimes and what feasts.  
See here’s a famous kitchen-range she brings;  
’Tis blacked a little: for in times of Peace  
The jovial Council kept its saucepans there.

Take her and welcome her with joy; and then  
To-morrow morning let the sports begin:  
Then we’ll enjoy the Fair in every fashion,  
With boxing-matches and with wrestling-bouts,  
And tricks and games, while striplings soused in oil  
Try the pancratium, fist and leg combined.

Then the third day from this, we’ll hold the races;  
The eager jockeys riding: the great cars  
Puffing and blowing through the lists, till dashed  
Full on some turning-post, they reel and fall  
Over and over: everywhere you see  
The hapless coachmen wallowing on the plain.

You lucky Magistrate, receive Mayfair!  
Just look, how pleased he seems to introduce her;  
You would not though, if you got nothing by it,  
No, you’d be holding a Reception day:

Ch. Truly we envy your fate:  
All must allow you’re a great  
Blessing and boon to the state.

Tr. Ah, when your grapes you gather in,  
you’ll know what sort of friend I’ve been.

Ch. Nay, but already ’tis known;  
Yea, for already we own  
You have preserved us alone.

Tr. I think you’ll think so when you drain  
a bowl of new-made wine again.

Ch. We’ll always hold you first and best,  
except the Gods the ever blest.

Tr. In truth you owe a deal to me,  
Trygaeus, sprung from Athmone,  
For I’ve released the burgher crew  
And farmers too  
From toils and troubles not a few;  
Hyperbolus I’ve done for.

1st S. Now what’s the next thing that we have to do?

Tr. What but to dedicate her shrine with pipkins?

1st S. With pipkins! like a wretched little Hermes!

Tr. Well then, what think you of a stall-fed bull?

1st S. A bull? O no! no need of bull-works now.

Tr. Well then, a great fat pig?

1st S. No, no.

Tr. Why not?

1st S. Lest, like Theagenes, we grow quite piggish.

Tr. What other victim shall we have?

1st S. A baa-lamb.

Tr. A baa-lamb!

1st S. Yes, by Zeus!

Tr. But that’s Ionic, that word is.

1st S. All the better: then, you see,  
If any speak for war, the whole assembly  
Will talk Ionic and cry out Bah! Bah!

Tr. Good, very good.

1st S. And they’ll be milder so,  
And we shall live like lambs among ourselves,  
And be much gentler towards our dear allies.

Tr. There, get the sheep as quickly as you can,  
I’ll find an altar for the sacrifice.

(Exeunt Trygaeus and servant.)

Ch. Sure each design, when God and fortune speed it,  
Succeeds to our mind, what is wanted we find  
Just at the moment we need it.

Tr. (returning) The truths you mention none can doubt,  
for see I’ve brought the altar out.

Ch. Then hasten the task to perform:  
War, with its vehement storm,  
Seems for the instant to cease;  
Its soughings decrease,  
Shifting and veering to Peace.

Tr. Well, here’s the basket ready stored  
with barley grain, and wreath, and sword.  
And here’s the pan of sacred fire:  
the sheep alone we now require.

Ch. Make haste, make haste: if Chaeris see,  
He’ll come here uninvited,  
And pipe and blow to that degree,  
His windy labours needs must be  
By some small gift requited.

Enter servant.

Tr. Here, take the basket and the lustral water,  
And pace the altar round from left to right,

1st S. See, I’ve been round: now tell me something else.

Tr. Then next I’ll take this torch and dip it in.

(to the victim, as he sprinkles it)  
Shake your head, sirrah,

(to the servant) bring the barley, you;  
I’ll hold the basin while you wash your hands.  
Now throw the corn amongst the audience,

1st S. There.

Tr. What! thrown it out already?

1st S. Yes, by Hermes!  
There’s not a single man amongst them all  
But has at least one corn, I’ll warrant you.

Tr. Aye, but the women?

1st S. If they haven’t got one,  
They’ll get it by and by.

Tr. Now, then to prayers:  
Who’s here? where are our honest simple folk?

1st S. Here: these are simple folk; I’ll give to them.

Tr. What, these good simple folk?

1st S. I’faith I think so;  
Who, though we’ve poured such lots of water on them  
Yet stand stock still, and never budge a step.

Tr. Come, let us pray, no dallying; let us pray.

O Peace most holy, august, serene,  
O heavenborn queen  
Of the dance and song and the bridal throng,  
These offerings take which thy votaries make.

1st S. O mistress dear, we beseech you hear,  
And act not you as the wantons do:  
They love to spy at the passers by  
Through the half-closed door,  
And then if you heed, they are gone with speed;  
If you turn away, in an instant they  
Peep out once more as they did before.  
But deal not thus unkindly with us.

Tr. No, by Zeus! but display in a true honest way  
Your perfect entire full form to our view,  
Who with constant desire  
These thirteen long years have been pining for you.  
When our fightings are stayed, and our tumults allay'd,  
We will hail thee a Lady forever:  
And O put an end to the whispers of doubt,  
These wonderful clever ingenious suspicions we bandy about;  
And solder and glue the Hellenes anew  
With the old-fashioned true Elixir of love, and attemper our mind  
With thoughts of each other more genial and kind.  
Moreover we pray that our market-place may  
Be furnished each day with a goodly display,  
And for garlic, and cucumbers early and rare,  
Pomegranates, and apples in heaps to be there,  
And wee little coats for our servants to wear.

And Boeotia to send us her pigeons and widgeons,  
And her geese and her plovers: and plentiful creels  
Once more from Copais to journey with eels,  
And for us to be hustling, and tussling, and bustling,  
With Morychus, Teleas, Glaucetes, all  
The gluttons together besieging the stall,  
To purchase the fish: and then I could wish  
For Melanthius to come too late for the fair,  
And for them to be sold, and for him to despair,  
And out of his own Medea a groan  
Of anguish to borrow,  
“I perish! I perish! bereaved of my sweet,  
My treasure, my darling, embowered in her beet”;  
And for all men to laugh at his sorrow.  
These things we pray; O mistress, grant us these.

1st S. Here, take the cleaver: now with clever skill  
Slaughter the sheep.

Tr. No, no, I must not.

1st S. Why?

Tr. Peace loves not, friend, the sight of victims slain:  
Hers is a bloodless altar. Take it in,  
And when you have slain it, bring the thighs out here.  
There: now the sheep is — saved for the Choregus.

(Exit servant.)

Ch. But you the while, outside with us remaining,  
Lay, handy and quick, these fagots of stick,  
Whatever is needful ordaining.

Tr. Now don’t you think I have laid the wood  
as well as most diviners could?

Ch. (admiringly) Yes! just what I looked for from you.  
All that is wise you can do.  
All things that daring and skill
[^1]: The interdict prohibiting the Megarians from all intercourse with the Athenian empire.

# THE PEACE

Suffice to fulfil
You can perform if you will.

Tr. (coughing) Dear! how this lighted brand is
smoking,
your Stilbides is nearly choking;
I’ll bring the table out with speed;
a servant’s help we shall not need. *Exit*.

Ch. Sure all with admiration true
Will praise a man so clever,
Who passed such toils and dangers through,
And saved the holy city too;
An envied name forever.

*Enter servant and Trygaeus*.

1st S. I’ve done the job; here take and cook the thighs
While I go fetch the inwards and the cates.

Tr. I’ll see to this: you should have come before.

1st S. Well, here I am: I’m sure I’ve not been long.

Tr. Take these, and roast them nicely: here’s a fellow
Coming this way, with laurel round his head.
Who can he be?

1st S. He looks an arrant humbug.
Some seer, I think.

Tr. No, no; ’tis Hierocles,
The oracle-mongering chap from Oreus town.

1048-1079

1st S. What brings him here?

Tr. ’Tis evident he comes
To raise some opposition to our truces.

1st S. No, ’tis the savour of the roast attracts him.

Tr. Don’t let us seem to notice him.

1st S. All right.

*Enter Hierocles*.

Hierocles. What is this sacrifice, and made to whom?

Tr. Roast on: don’t speak: hands off the haunch remember.

Hi. Will ye not say to whom ye sacrifice?
This tail looks right.

1st S. Sweet Peace! it does indeed.

Hi. Now then begin and hand the firstlings here.

Tr. It must be roasted first.

Hi. It’s roasted now.

Tr. You’re over-busy, man, whoe’er you are.
Cut on: why, where’s the table? bring the wine.

*Exit SERVANT*.

Hi. The tongue requires a separate cut.

Tr. We know.
Now will you please?

Hi. Yes, tell me.

Tr. Mind your business.
Don’t talk to us: we sacrifice to Peace.

Hi. O ye pitiful fools!

Tr. Pray speak for yourself, my good fellow.

Hi. Ye who, blindly perverse,
with the will of the Gods unacquainted,
Dare to traffic for Peace,
true men with truculent monkeys.

1st S. (*re-entering*) O! O! O!

Tr. What’s the matter?

1st S. I like his truculent monkeys.

Hi. Silly and timorous gulls,
ye have trusted the children of foxes
Crafty of mind and crafty of soul.

Tr. You utter impostor,
O that your lungs were as hot
as a piece of the meat I am roasting!

Hi. If the prophetic nymphs
have not been imposing on Bakis,
No, nor Bakis on men,
nor the nymphs, I repeat, upon Bakis,

Tr. O perdition be yours
if you don’t have done with your Bakis!

Hi. Then is the hour not come
for the fetters of Peace to be loosened.
No; for before that hour—

Tr. This piece is with salt to be sprinkled.

Hi. Yea, it is far from the mind
of the Ever-blessed Immortals
That we should cease from the strife,
till the wolf and the lamb be united.

Tr. How, you scoundrel accurst,
can the wolf and the lamb be united?

Hi. Doth not the beetle, alarmed,
emit a most horrible odour?
Doth not the wagtail yapper
produce blind young in its hurry?
So is the hour not come
for Peace to be sanctioned between us.

1080-1111

Tr. What then, what is to come?
Are we never to cease from the battle,
Always to chance it out,
which most can enfeeble the other,
When we might both join hands,
and share the dominion of Hellas?

Hi. Canst thou tutor the crab
to advance straight forward? thou canst not.

Tr. Wilt thou dine any more
in the Hall of Assembly? thou wilt not;
No, nor ever again
shall thy cheating knavery prosper.

Hi. Thou wilt never be able
to smooth the spines of the hedgehog.

Tr. Wilt thou never desist
bamboozling the people of Athens?

Hi. Say, what oracle taught you
to burn the thighs of the victim?

Tr. This, the wisest and best,
delivered by Homer the poet:
> “When they had driven afar
> the detestable cloud of the battle,
> Then they established Peace,
> and welcomed her back with oblations,
> Duly the thighs they burned,
> and ate the tripe and the inwards.
> Then poured out the libations;
> and I was the guide and the leader;
> None to the soothsayer gave
> the shining beautiful goblet.”

Hi. Nothing I know of these:
these did not come from the Sibyl.

Tr. Nay, but wisely and well
spake Homer the excellent poet:
> “Tribeless, lawless, and hearthless
> is he that delighteth in bloodshed,
> Bloodshed of kith and kin,
> heart-sickening, horrible, hateful!”

Hi. Take thou heed, or a kite,
by a trick thy attention beguiling,
Down with a swoop may pounce.

Tr. (*to the servant*) Ah! take heed really and truly.
That’s an alarming hint:
it bodes no good to the inwards.
Pour the libation in,
and hand me a piece of the inwards.

Hi. Nay, but if such is the plan,
I too for myself will be caterer.

Tr. Pour libation! pour libation!

Hi. Pour it in also for me,
and reach me a share of the inwards.

Tr. That is far from the mind
of the Ever-blessed Immortals.
Yea, for before that hour—
—you go, we'll pour the libation.
Holy and reverend Peace,
abide with thy servants forever.

Hi. Now, fetch hither the tongue.

Tr. You, take yours off I’d advise you.

Hi. Pour the libation in.

Tr. Take that to assist the libation.

Hi. What! will none of you give me some meat?

1111-1150

Tr. ’Tis strictly forbidden.
You no inwards can have
till the wolf and the lamb be united.

Hi. Do, by your knees I beseech.

Tr. But fruitless are all your beseechings.
Thou wilt never be able
to smooth the spines of the hedgehog.
Come now, spectators, won’t you share the mess
Along with us?

Hi. And I?

Tr. You? Eat your Sibyl.

Hi. No, by the Earth, you two shan’t feast alone!
I’ll snatch a piece away: ’tis all in common.

Tr. Strike Bakis, strike!

Hi. I call them all to witness—

Tr. And so do I, that you’re a rogue and glutton.
Lay on him with the stick: strike, strike the rascal!

1st S. You manage that, while I peel off the skins
Which he has gathered by his cozening tricks.
Now, sacrificer, off with all your skins.
What, won’t you? Here’s a crow from Oreus town!
Back to Elymnium! flutter off: shoo! shoo!

*Exeunt Hierocles, Trygaeus, and servant*.

Chorus
What a pleasure, what a treasure,
What a great delight to me,
From the cheese and from the onions
And the helmet to be free.
For I can’t enjoy a battle,
But I love to pass my days
With my wine and boon companions
Round the merry, merry blaze,
When the logs are dry and seasoned,
And the fire is burning bright,
And I roast the pease and chestnuts
In the embers all alight,
—Flirting too with Thratta
When my wife is out of sight.
Ah, there’s nothing half so sweet as
when the seed is in the ground,
God a gracious rain is sending,
and a neighbour saunters round.
“O Comarchides!” he hails me:
“how shall we enjoy the hours?”
“Drinking seems to suit my fancy,
what with these benignant showers.
Therefore let three quarts, my mistress,
of your kidney-beans be fried,
Mix them nicely up with barley,
and your choicest figs provide;
Syra run and shout to Manes,
call him in without delay,
’Tis no time to stand and dawdle
pruning out the vines today,
Nor to break the clods about them,
now the ground is soaking through.
Bring me out from home the fieldfare,
bring me out the siskins two,
Then there ought to be some beestings,
four good plates of hare beside

1151-1188

(Hah! unless the cat purloined them
yesterday at eventide;
Something scuffled in the pantry,
something made a noise and fuss);
If you find them, one’s for father,
bring the other three to us.
Ask Aeschinades to send us
myrtle branches green and strong;
Bid Charinades attend us,
shouting as you pass along.
Then we’ll sit and drink together,
God the while refreshing, blessing
All the labour of our hands.”
O to watch the grape of Lemnos
Swelling out its purple skin,
When the merry little warblings
Of the Chirruper begin;
For the Lemnian ripens early.
And I watch the juicy fig
Till at last I pick and eat it
When it hangeth soft and big;
And I bless the friendly seasons
Which have made a fruit so prime,
And I mix a pleasant mixture,
Grating in a lot of thyme,
—Growing fat and hearty
In the genial summer clime.
This is better than a Captain
hated of the Gods to see,
Triple-crested, scarlet-vested,
scarlet bright as bright can be.
’Tis, he says, true Sardian tincture,
which they warrant not to run;
But if e’er it gets to fighting,
though his scarlet coat be on,
He himself becomes as pallid
as the palest Cyzicene,
Running like a tawny cockhorse,
he’s the first to quit the scene;
Shake and quake his crests above him:
I stood gaping while he flew.
Ah, but when at home they’re stationed,
things that can’t be borne they do,
Making up the lists unfairly,
striking out and putting down
Names at random. ’Tis tomorrow
that the soldiers leave the town;
One poor wretch has bought no victuals,
for he knew not he must go
Till he on Pandion’s statue
spied the list and found ’twas so,
Reading there his name inserted;
off he scuds with aspect wry.
This is how they treat the farmers,
but the burghers certainly
Somewhat better: godless wretches,
rogues with neither shame nor—shield.
Who one day, if God be willing,
strict accounts to me shall yield.
For they’ve wronged me much and sorely:

1189-1233

Very lions in the city,
Very foxes in the fight.

*Re-enter Trygaeus and servant*.

Tr. Hillo! Hillo!
What lots are coming to the wedding supper!
Here, take this crest and wipe the tables down,
I’ve no more use for that, at all events.
And now serve up the thrushes and the cates,
And the hot rolls, and quantities of hare.

*Enter sickle-maker*.

Sickle-Maker. Where, where’s Trygaeus?

Tr. Stewing thrushes here.

S.-M. O, my best friend, Trygaeus! O what blessings
Your gift of Peace has brought us. Till today
No man would give one farthing for a sickle;
And now! I’m selling them two pounds apiece.
And my friend here sells casks for country use
Half a crown each. Trygaeus, freely take
As many casks and sickles as you please.
And take this too (*giving money*); out of our sales and gains
We bring you these, we two, as wedding presents.

Tr. Well, lay your presents down, and hie you in
To join the marriage feast: here comes a man
Who trades in arms: he seems put out at something.

*Enter crest-maker, breastplate-seller, TRUMPETER, HELMET-SELLER, and SPEAR-BURNISHER*.

Crest-Maker. O you’ve destroyed me root and
branch, Trygaeus.

Tr. How now, poor wretch! what ails you? got a crest-ache?

C.-M. You have destroyed my living and my trade,
And this man’s too, and yon spear-burnisher’s.

Tr. What shall I give you, then, for these two crests?

C.-M. What will you give?

Tr. Faith, I’m ashamed to say:
Come, there’s a deal of work about this juncture;
I’ll give three quarts of raisins for the pair.
’Twill do to wipe my table down withal.

C.-M. Go in, then, go, and fetch the raisins out.
Better have that than nothing, O my friend.

Tr. Consume the things! here, take them, take them off.
The hairs are dropping out; they’re not worth having.
Zounds! I’ll not give one raisin for the pair.

Breastplate-Seller. O what’s the use of this habergeon now?
So splendidly got up: cost forty pounds.

Tr. Well, well, you shan’t lose anything by that:
I’ll buy it of you at its full cost price.
’Twill do superbly for my chamber-pan.

B.-S. Come, don’t be mocking at my wares and me.

Tr. Placing three stones anent it: ain’t that clever?

B.-S. And how, you blockhead, can you cleanse yourself?

Tr. How? slip my hands in through the portholes,
here,
And here.

B.-S. What, both at once!

Tr. Yes; I’ll not cheat.
I’ll have fair play: an arm for every hole.

B.-S. Sure, you won’t use a forty-pounder so.

Tr. Why not, you rascal? Marry, I suppose
My seat of honour’s worth eight hundred shillings.

B.-S. Well, fetch the silver out.

Tr. Plague take the thing;
It galls my stern: off with you: I won’t buy it.

Tru. See, here’s a trumpet, cost me two pounds ten:
How in the world am I to use it now?

Tr. I’ll tell you how. Fill up this mouth with lead,
Then fix a longish rod, here at the top,
And there you’ll have a dropping *cottabus*.

Tru. O me! he mocks me.

Tr. Here’s another plan:
Pour in the lead as I advised before,
Then at the top suspend a pair of scales
With little cords, and there’s a famous balance
To weigh out figs for labourers on the farm.

H.-S. Thou hast destroyed me, dread unpitying Fate!
These helmets stood me in a good four pounds.
What am I now to do? who’ll buy them now?

Tr. Take them to Egypt: you can sell them there.
They’re just the things they measure physic in.

Tru. O, helmet-seller, we are both undone.

Tr. Why, he's received no hurt.

H.-S. Received no hurt!
Pray what’s the use of all these helmets now?

Tr. Just clap on each a pair of ears, like these,
They’ll sell much better then than now they will.

H.-S. O come away, spear-burnisher.

Tr. No, no.
I’m going to buy his spears: I really am.

S.-B. What are you going to give?

Tr. Saw them in two,
I’ll buy them all for vine-poles, ten a penny.

S.-B. The man insults us: come away, my friend.

Tr. Aye, go your way, for here come out the boys,
Those whom the guests have brought us; I suppose
They’re going to practise what they’re going to sing.
Come and stand here by me, my boy, and then
Let’s hear you practise what you mean to sing.

*Enter a group of young boys*.

1st Boy. “Sing of the younger blood, whose deeds”—

Tr. Plague take you, be quiet
Singing of deeds of blood:
and that, you unfortunate ill-starred
Wretch, in the time of Peace;
you’re a shameful and ignorant blockhead.

1st B. “Slowly the hosts approached,
till at length with a shock of encounter[^1]
Shield was dashed upon shield,
and round-bossed buckler on buckler.”

Tr. Buckler? you’d better be still:
how dare you be talking of bucklers?

[^1]: Quoting a line that occurs eleven times in the *Iliad*. The other lines quoted by the Boy are from Homer or in the Homeric language.

1233-1275

1st B. “Rose the rattle of war
commingled with groans of the dying.”

Tr. Groans of the dying?
by great Dionysus, I’ll make you repent it,
Singing of groans of the dying,
especially such as are round-bossed.

1st B. What, then, what shall I sing?
you, tell me the songs you delight in.

Tr. “Then on the flesh of beeves
they feasted”; something of that sort.
“Then a repast they served,
and whatever is best for a banquet.”

1st B. “Then on the flesh of beeves
they feasted, aweary of fighting;
Then from the yoke they loosed
the reeking necks of the horses.”

Tr. Good: they were tired of war, and so they feasted:
Sing on, O sing, how they were tired and feasted.

1st B. “Quickly, refreshed, they called for the casques.”

Tr. Casks? gladly, I warrant.

1st B. “Out from the towers they poured,
and the roar of battle ascended.”

Tr. Perdition seize you, boy, your wars and all!
You sing of nought but battles: who’s your father?

1st B. Whose? mine?

Tr. Yes, yours, by Zeus!

1st B. Why, Lamachus.

Tr. Ugh, out upon it!
Truly I marvelled, and thought
to myself as I heard your performance,
This is the son of some hacker,
and thwacker, and sacker of cities.
Get to the spearmen, sing to them: begone.
Here, here, I want Cleonymus’s son.
You, sing before we enter: sure I am
You won’t sing wars: you’ve too discreet a father.

2nd Boy “Ah! some Saean is vaunting
the targe, which I in the bushes
Sadly, a blameless shield,
left as I fled from the field.”

Tr. Tell me, you pretty baboon,
are you making a mock of your father?

2nd B. “Nay, but my life I preserved,”

Tr. But you shamed the parents who gave it.
Well go we in, for sure I am that you,
Being your father’s son, will nevermore
Forget the song you sang about the shield.
Now then ’tis right, my jolly rogues,
that you should, here remaining,
Munch, crunch, and bite with all your might,
no empty vessels draining;
With manly zeal attack the meal,
And saw and gnaw with either jaw,
there’s no advantage really
In having white and polished teeth
unless you use them freely.

1276-1310

Ch. O aye, we know: we won’t be slow;
but thanks for thus reminding.

Tr. Set to, set to: you starving crew:
you won’t be always finding
Such dishes rare of cake and hare
An easy prey in open day
thus wandering unprotected.
Set to, set to: or soon you’ll rue
a splendid chance neglected.

Ch. O let not a word of ill-omen be heard,
but some of you run for the bride;
Some, torches to bring while the multitudes sing
and dance and rejoice by her side.
We’ll carry the husbandry implements back
our own little homesteads about,
When we’ve had our ovation, and poured our libation,
and hunted Hyperbolus out.
But first we’ll pray to the Gods that they
May with rich success the Hellenes bless,
And that every field may its harvest yield,
And our garners shine with the corn and wine,
While our figs in plenty and peace we eat,
And our wives are blest with an increase sweet;
And we gather back in abundant store
The many blessings we lost before;
And the fiery steel—be it known no more.

Tr. Come then, come, my bride.
Midst the free green fields with me
Sweetly, sweet, abide.
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*

Ch. Happy, happy, happy you,
And you well deserve it too.
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*

Semi-Ch. What shall with the bride be done,
What be done with Harvest-home?

Semi-Ch. She shall yield him, one by one,
All the joys of Harvest-home.

Semi-Ch. Ye to whom the task belongs
Raise the happy bridegroom, raise,
Bear him on with goodly songs,
Bear him on with nuptial lays.
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*

Semi-Ch. Go and dwell in peace:
Not a care your lives impair,
Watch your figs increase.
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*

Semi-Ch. He is stout and big.

Semi-Ch. She a sweeter fig.

Tr. So you all will think
When you feast and drink.

Ch. *Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*
*Hymen, Hymenaeus O!*

Tr. Away, away, good day, good day;
Follow me, sirs, if ye will,
And of bridecakes eat your fill.

1311-1357
