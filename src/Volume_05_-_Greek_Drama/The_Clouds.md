*At the back of the stage are two buildings—the house of Strepsiades and the Phrontisterion. The interior of the first is exposed to view by means of the eccyclema.*
*Strepsiades and Pheidippides discovered in bed.*

Strepsiades. O dear! O dear!
O Lord! O Zeus! these nights, how long they are!
Will they ne'er pass? Will the day never come?
Surely I heard the cock crow hours ago.
Yet still my servants snore. These are new customs.
O, 'ware of war for many various reasons;
One fears in war even to flog one's servants.
And here's this hopeful son of mine wrapped up
Snoring and sweating under five thick blankets.
Come, we'll wrap up and snore in opposition.

*Tries to sleep.*

But I can't sleep a wink, devoured and bitten
By ticks, and bugbears, duns, and race-horses,
All through this son of mine. He curls his hair,
And sports his thoroughbreds, and drives his
tandem;
Even in dreams he rides: while I—I'm ruined,
Now that the Moon has reached her twentieths,
And paying-time comes on. Boy! Light a lamp,
And fetch my ledger: now I'll reckon up
Who are my creditors, and what I owe them.
Come, let me see then. Fifty pounds to Pasias!
Why fifty pounds to Pasias? What were they for?
O, for the hack from Corinth. O dear! O dear!
I wish my eye had been hacked out before—
Pheidippides. (in his sleep) You are cheating, Philion; keep to your own side.
St. Ah! there it is! That's what has ruined me!
Even in his very sleep he thinks of horses.
Ph. (in his sleep) How many heats do the war-
chariots run?
St. A pretty many heats you have run your
father.
Now then, what debt assails me after Pasias?
A curricle and wheels. Twelve pounds. Amynias.
Ph. (in his sleep) Here, give the horse a roll, and
take him home.
St. You have rolled me out of house and home,
my boy,
Cast in some suits already, while some swear
They'll seize my goods for payment.
Ph. Good, my father,
What makes you toss so restless all night long?
St. There's a bumbailiff from the mattress bites
me.
Ph. Come now, I prithee, let me sleep in peace.
St. Well then, you sleep; only be sure of this,
These debts will fall on your own head at last.
Alas, alas!
Forever cursed be that same match-maker,
Who stirred me up to marry your poor mother.
Mine in the country was the pleasantest life,
Untidy, easy-going, unrestrained,
Brimming with olives, sheepfolds, honey-bees.
Ah! then I married—I a rustic—her
A fine town-lady, niece of Megacles.
A regular, proud, luxurious Coesyra.
This wife I married, and we came together,
I rank with wine-lees, fig-boards, greasy woolpacks;
She all with scents, and saffron, and tongue-kissings,
Feasting, expense, and lordly modes of loving.
She was not idle though, she was too fast.
I used to tell her, holding out my cloak,
Threadbare and worn: "Wife, you're too fast by
half."
*Enter Servant-Boy.*
Servant-Boy. Here's no more oil remaining in the
lamp.
St. O me! What made you light the tippling
lamp?
Come and be whipped.
S.-B. Why, what would you whip me for?
St. Why did you put one of those thick wicks in?
Well, when at last to me and my good woman
This hopeful son was born, our son and heir,
Why then we took to wrangle on the name.
She was for giving him some knightly name,
"Callippides," "Xanthippus," or "Charippus":
I wished "Pheidonides," his grandsire's name.
Thus for some time we argued: till at last
We compromised it in Pheidippides.
This boy she took, and used to spoil him, saying,
"Oh! when you are driving to the Acropolis, clad
Like Megacles, in your purple"; whilst I said,
"Oh! when the goats you are driving from the fells,
Clad like your father, in your sheepskin coat."
Well, he cared nought for my advice, but soon
A galloping consumption caught my fortunes.
Now cogitating all night long, I've found
One way, one marvellous transcendent way,
Which if he'll follow, we may yet be saved.
So—but, however, I must rouse him first;
But how to rouse him kindliest? That's the rub.
Pheidippides, my sweet one.
Ph. Well, my father.
St. Shake hands, Pheidippides, shake hands and
kiss me.
Ph. There; what's the matter?
St. Dost thou love me, boy?
Ph. Ay, by Poseidon there, the God of horses.
St. No, no, not that: miss out the God of horses,
That God's the origin of all my evils.
But if you love me from your heart and soul,
My son, obey me.
Ph. Very well: what in?
St. Strip with all speed, strip off your present
habits,
And go and learn what I'll advise you to.
Ph. Name your commands.
St. Will you obey?
Ph. I will,
By Dionysus!
St. Well then, look this way.
See you that wicket and the lodge beyond?
Ph. I see: and prithee what is that, my father?
St. That is the thinking-house of sapient souls.
There dwell the men who teach—aye, who per-
suade us,
That Heaven is one vast fire-extinguisher
Placed round about us, and that we're the cinders.
Aye, and they'll teach (only they'll want some
money),
How one may speak and conquer, right or wrong.
Ph. Come, tell their names.
St. Well, I can't quite remember,
But they're deep thinkers, and true gentlemen.
Ph. Out on the rogues! I know them. Those rank
pedants,
Those pale-faced, barefoot vagabonds you mean:
That Socrates, poor wretch, and Chaerephon.
St. Oh! Oh! Hush! Hush! Don't use those foolish
words;
But if the sorrows of my barley touch you,
Enter their Schools and cut the Turf forever.
Ph. I wouldn't go, so help me Dionysus,
For all Leogoras' breed of Phasians!
St. Go, I beseech you, dearest, dearest son,
Go and be taught.
Ph. And what would you have me learn?
St. 'Tis known that in their Schools they keep
two Logics,
The Worse, Zeus save the mark, the Worse and
Better.
This second Logic then, I mean the Worse one,
They teach to talk unjustly and—prevail.
Think then, you only learn that Unjust Logic,
And all the debts, which I have incurred through
you,
I'll never pay, no, not one farthing of them.
Ph. I will not go. How could I face the knights
With all my colour worn and torn away!
St. O! Then, by Earth, you have eat your last of
mine,
You, and your coach-horse, and your sigma-brand:
Out with you! Go to the crows, for all I care.
Ph. But uncle Megacles won't leave me long
Without a horse: I'll go to him: good-bye.
*Exit.*

*Strepsiades crosses to the Phrontisterion.*
St. I'm thrown, by Zeus, but I won't long lie
prostrate.
I'll pray the Gods and send myself to school:
I'll go at once and try their thinking-house.
Stay: how can I, forgetful, slow, old fool,
Learn the nice hair-splittings of subtle Logic?
Well, go I must. 'T won't do to linger here.
Come on, I'll knock the door. Boy! Ho there, boy!
Student. (within) O, hang it all! Who's knocking
at the door?
St. Me! Pheidon's son: Strepsiades of Cicynna.
Stu. Why, what a clown you are! To kick our door,
In such a thoughtless, inconsiderate way!
You've made my cogitation to miscarry.
St. Forgive me: I'm an awkward country fool.
But tell me, what was that I made miscarry?
Stu. 'Tis not allowed: Students alone may hear.
St. O, that's all right: you may tell me: I'm come
To be a student in your thinking-house.
Stu. Come then. But they're high mysteries,
remember.
'Twas Socrates was asking Chaerephon,
How many feet of its own a flea could jump.
For one first bit the brow of Chaerephon,
Then bounded off to Socrates' head.
St. How did he measure this?
Stu. Most cleverly.
He warmed some wax, and then he caught the flea,
And dipped its feet into the wax he'd melted:
Then let it cool, and there were Persian slippers!
These he took off, and so he found the distance.
St. O Zeus and King, what subtle intellects!
Stu. What would you say then if you heard
another,
Our Master's own?
St. O come, do tell me that.
Stu. Why, Chaerephon was asking him in turn,
Which theory did he sanction: that the gnats
Hummed through their mouth, or backwards,
through the tail?
St. Aye, and what said your Master of the gnat?
Stu. He answered thus: the entrail of the gnat
Is small: and through this narrow pipe the wind
Rushes with violence straight towards the tail;
There, close against the pipe, the hollow rump
Receives the wind, and whistles to the blast.
St. So then the rump is trumpet to the gnats!
O happy, happy in your entrail-learning!
Full surely need he fear nor debts nor duns,
Who knows about the entrails of the gnats.
Stu. And yet last night a mighty thought we lost
Through a green lizard.
St. Tell me, how was that?
Stu. Why, as Himself, with eyes and mouth wide
open,
Mused on the moon, her paths and revolutions,
A lizard from the roof squirted full on him.
St. He, he, he, he. I like the lizard's spattering
Socrates.
Stu. Then yesterday, poor we, we'd got no dinner.
St. Hah! What did he devise to do for barley?
Stu. He sprinkled on the table—some fine ash—
He bent a spit—he grasped it compass-wise—
And—filched a mantle from the Wrestling School.
St. Good heavens! Why Thales was a fool to this!
O open, open, wide the study door,
And show me, show me, show me Socrates.
I die to be a student. Open, open! [^1]
O Heracles, what kind of beasts are these!
Stu. Why, what's the matter? What do you think
they're like?
St. Like? Why those Spartans whom we brought
from Pylus:
What makes them fix their eyes so on the ground?
Stu. They seek things underground.
St. O! To be sure,
Truffles! You there, don't trouble about that!
I'll tell you where the best and finest grow.
Look! Why do those stoop down so very much?
Stu. They're diving deep into the deepest secrets.
St. Then why's their rump turned up towards
the sky?
Stu. It's taking private lessons on the stars.
(*to the other Students*)
Come, come: get in: he'll catch us presently.
St. Not yet! Not yet! Just let them stop one
moment,
While I impart a little matter to them.
Stu. No, no: they must go in: 'twould never do
To expose themselves too long to the open air.
St. O! By the Gods, now, what are these? Do tell
me.
Stu. This is Astronomy.
St. And what is this?
Stu. Geometry.
St. Well, what's the use of that?
Stu. To mete out lands.
St. What, for allotment grounds?
Stu. No, but all lands.
St. A choice idea, truly.
Then every man may take his choice, you mean.
Stu. Look; here's a chart of the whole world. Do
you see?
This city's Athens.
St. Athens? I like that.
I see no dicasts sitting. That's not Athens.
Stu. In very truth, this is the Attic ground.
St. And where then are my townsmen of
Cicynna?
Stu. Why, thereabouts; and here, you see,
Euboea:
Here, reaching out a long way by the shore.
St. Yes, overreached by us and Pericles.
But now, where's Sparta?
Stu. Let me see: O, here.
St. Heavens! How near us. O, do please manage
this,
To shove her off from us, a long way further.
Stu. We can't do that, by Zeus.
St. The worse for you.
Hallo! Who's that? That fellow in the basket?
Stu. That's he.
St. Who's he?
Stu. Socrates.
St. Socrates!
You sir, call out to him as loud as you can.
Stu. Call him yourself: I have not leisure now.

*The machine swings Socrates in.*
St. Socrates! Socrates!
Sweet Socrates!
Socrates. Mortal! Why call'st thou me?
St. O, first of all, please tell me what you are
doing.
So. I walk on air, and contemplate the Sun.
St. O then from a basket you contemn the Gods,
And not from the earth, at any rate?
So. Most true.
I could not have searched out celestial matters
Without suspending judgment, and infusing
My subtle spirit with the kindred air.
If from the ground I were to seek these things,
I could not find: so surely doth the earth
Draw to herself the essence of our thought.
The same too is the case with water-cress.
St. Hillo! What's that?
Thought draws the essence into water-cress?
Come down, sweet Socrates, more near my level,
And teach the lessons which I come to learn.
So. (descending) And wherefore art thou come?
St. To learn to speak.
For owing to my horrid debts and duns,
My goods are seized, I'm robbed, and mobbed, and
plundered.
So. How did you get involved with your eyes
open?
St. A galloping consumption seized my money.
Come now: do let me learn the Unjust Logic
That can shirk debts: now do just let me learn it.
Name your own price, by all the Gods I'll pay it.
So. The Gods! Why you must know the Gods
with us
Don't pass for current coin.
St. Eh? What do you use then?
Have you got iron, as the Byzantines have?
So. Come, would you like to learn celestial
matters,
How their truth stands?
St. Yes, if there's any truth.
So. And to hold intercourse with yon bright
Clouds,
Our virgin Goddesses?
St. Yes, that I should.
So. Then sit you down upon that sacred bed.
St. Well, I am sitting.
So. Here then, take this chaplet.
St. Chaplet? Why? Why? Now, never, Socrates:
Don't sacrifice poor me, like Athamas.
So. Fear not: our entrance-services require
All to do this.
St. But what am I to gain?
So. You'll be the flower of talkers, prattlers,
gossips:
Only keep quiet.
St. Zeus! Your words come true!
I shall be flour indeed with all this peppering.
So. Old man, sit you still, and attend to my will,
and hearken in peace to my prayer,
O Master and King, holding earth in your swing,
O measureless infinite Air;
And thou glowing Ether, and Clouds who en-
wreathe her
with thunder, and lightning, and storms,
Arise ye and shine, bright Ladies Divine,
to your student in bodily forms.
St. No, but stay, no, but stay, just one moment
I pray,
while my cloak round my temples I wrap.
To think that I've come, stupid fool, from my
home,
with never a waterproof cap!
So. Come forth, come forth, dread Clouds, and
to earth
your glorious majesty show;
Whether lightly ye rest on the time-honoured crest
of Olympus environed in snow,
Or tread the soft dance 'mid the stately expanse
of Ocean, the nymphs to beguile,
Or stoop to enfold with your pitchers of gold,
the mystical waves of the Nile,
Or around the white foam of Maeotis ye roam,
or Mimas all wintry and bare,
O hear while we pray, and turn not away
from the rites which your servants prepare.

*Chorus of Clouds appears.*
Chorus. Clouds of all hue,
Rise we aloft with our garments of dew.
Come from old Ocean's unchangeable bed,
Come, till the mountain's green summits we
tread,
Come to the peaks with their landscapes untold,
Gaze on the Earth with her harvests of gold,
Gaze on the rivers in majesty streaming,
Gaze on the lordly, invincible Sea,
Come, for the Eye of the Ether is beaming,
Come, for all Nature is flashing and free.
Let us shake off this close-clinging dew
From our members eternally new,
And sail upwards the wide world to view.
Come away! Come away!
So. O Goddesses mine, great Clouds and divine,
ye have heeded and answered my prayer.
Heard ye their sound, and the thunder around,
as it thrilled through the tremulous air?
St. Yes, by Zeus, and I shake, and I'm all of a
quake,
and I fear I must sound a reply,
Their thunders have made my soul so afraid,
and those terrible voices so nigh:
So if lawful or not, I must run to a pot,
by Zeus, if I stop I shall die.
So. Don't act in our schools like those Comedy-
fools
with their scurrilous, scandalous ways.
Deep silence be thine: while this Cluster divine
their soul-stirring melody raise.
Ch. Come then with me,
Daughters of Mist, to the land of the free.
Come to the people whom Pallas hath blest,
Come to the soil where the Mysteries rest;
Come, where the glorified Temple invites
The pure to partake of its mystical rites:
Holy the gifts that are brought to the Gods,
Shrines with festoons and with garlands are
crowned,
Pilgrims resort to the sacred abodes,
Gorgeous the festivals all the year round.
And the Bromian rejoicings in Spring,
When the flutes with their deep music ring,
And the sweetly-toned Choruses sing
Come away! Come away!
St. O Socrates, pray, by all the Gods, say,
for I earnestly long to be told,
Who are these that recite with such grandeur and
might?
are they glorified mortals of old?
So. No mortals are there, but Clouds of the air,
great Gods who the indolent fill:
These grant us discourse, and logical force,
and the art of persuasion instill,
And periphrasis strange, and a power to arrange,
and a marvellous judgement and skill.
St. So then when I heard their omnipotent word,
my spirit felt all of a flutter,
And it yearns to begin subtle cobwebs to spin
and about metaphysics to stutter,
And together to glue an idea or two,
and battle away in replies:
So if it's not wrong, I earnestly long
to behold them myself with my eyes.
So. Look up in the air, towards Parnes out there,
for I see they will pitch before long
These regions about.
St. Where? Point me them out.
So. They are drifting, an infinite throng,
And their long shadows quake over valley and
brake.
St. Why, whatever's the matter today?
I can't see, I declare.
So. By the Entrance; look there!
St. Ah, I just got a glimpse, by the way.
So. There, now you must see how resplendent
they be,
or your eyes must be pumpkins, I vow.
St. Ah! I see them proceed; I should think so
indeed:
great powers! They fill everything now.
So. So then till this day that celestials were they,
you never imagined or knew?
St. Why, no, on my word, for I always had heard
they were nothing but vapour and dew.
So. O, then I declare, you can't be aware
that 'tis these who the sophists protect,
Prophets sent beyond sea, quacks of every degree,
fops signet-and-jewel-bedecked,
Astrological knaves, and fools who their staves
of dithyrambs proudly rehearse—
'Tis the Clouds who all these support at their ease,
because they exalt them in verse.
St. 'Tis for this then they write of "the on-
rushin' might
o' the light-stappin' rain-drappin' Cloud,"
And the "thousand black curls whilk the Tempest-
lord whirls,"
and the "thunder-blast stormy an' loud,"
And "birds o' the sky floatin' upwards on high,"
and "air-water leddies" which "droon
Wi' their saft falling dew the gran' Ether sae blue,"
and then in return they gulp doon
Huge gobbets o' fishes an' bountifu' dishes
o' mavises prime in their season.
So. And is it not right such praise to requite?
St. Ah, but tell me then what is the reason
That if, as you say, they are Clouds, they today
as women appear to our view?
For the ones in the air are not women, I swear.
So. Why, what do they seem then to you?
St. I can't say very well, but they straggle and swell
like fleeces spread out in the air;
Not like women they flit, no, by Zeus, not a bit,
but these have got noses to wear.
So. Well, now then, attend to this question, my
friend.
St. Look sharp, and propound it to me.
So. Didst thou never espy a Cloud in the sky,
which a centaur or leopard might be,
Or a wolf, or a cow?
St. Very often, I vow:
and show me the cause, I entreat.
So. Why, I tell you that these become just what
they please,
and whenever they happen to meet
One shaggy and wild, like the tangle-haired child
of old Xenophantes, their rule
Is at once to appear like Centaurs, to jeer
the ridiculous look of the fool.
St. What then do they do if Simon they view,
that fraudulent harpy to shame?
So. Why, his nature to show to us mortals below,
a wolfish appearance they frame.
St. O, they then I ween having yesterday seen
Cleonymus quaking with fear,
(Him who threw off his shield as he fled from the
field),
metamorphosed themselves into deer.
So. Yes, and now they espy soft Cleisthenes nigh,
and therefore as women appear.
St. O then without fail, All hail! And All hail!
my welcome receive; and reply
With your voices so fine, so grand and divine,
majestical Queens of the Sky!
Ch. Our welcome to thee, old man, who wouldst
see
the marvels that science can show:
And thou, the high-priest of this subtlety feast,
say what would you have us bestow?
Since there is not a sage for whom we'd engage
our wonders more freely to do,
Except, it may be, for Prodicus; he
for his knowledge may claim them, but you,
For that sideways you throw your eyes as you go,
and are all affectation and fuss;
No shoes will you wear, but assume the grand air
on the strength of your dealings with us.
St. O Earth! What a sound, how august and
profound!
it fills me with wonder and awe.
So. These, these then alone, for true Deities own,
the rest are all Godships of straw.
St. Let Zeus be left out: He's a God beyond
doubt:
come, that you can scarcely deny.
So. Zeus, indeed! There's no Zeus: don't you be
so obtuse.
St. No Zeus up aloft in the sky!
Then, you first must explain, who it is sends the
rain;
or I really must think you are wrong.
So. Well then, be it known, these send it alone:
I can prove it by arguments strong.
Was there ever a shower seen to fall in an hour
when the sky was all cloudless and blue?
Yet on a fine day, when the Clouds are away,
he might send one, according to you.
St. Well, it must be confessed, that chimes in
with the rest:
your words I am forced to believe.
Yet before, I had dreamed that the rain-water
streamed
from Zeus and his chamber-pot sieve.
But whence then, my friend, does the thunder
descend?
that does make me quake with affright!
So. Why 'tis they, I declare, as they roll through
the air.
St. What, the Clouds? Did I hear you aright?
So. Ay: for when to the brim filled with water
they swim,
by Necessity carried along,
They are hung up on high in the vault of the sky,
and so by Necessity strong
In the midst of their course, they clash with great
force,
and thunder away without end.
St. But is it not He who compels this to be?
does not Zeus this Necessity send?
So. No Zeus have we there, but a Vortex of air.
St. What! Vortex? That's something, I own.
I knew not before, that Zeus was no more,
but Vortex was placed on his throne!
But I have not yet heard to what cause you
referred
the thunder's majestical roar.
So. Yes, 'tis they, when on high full of water
they fly,
and then, as I told you before,
By Compression impelled, as they clash, are
compelled
a terrible clatter to make.
St. Come, how can that be? I really don't see.
So. Yourself as my proof I will take.
Have you never then eat the broth-puddings you
get
when the Panathenaea comes round,
And felt with what might your bowels all night
in turbulent tumult resound?
St. By Apollo, 'tis true, there's a mighty to-do,
and my belly keeps rumbling about;
And the puddings begin to clatter within
and kick up a wonderful rout:
Quite gently at first, papa pax, papapax,
but soon pappapappax away,
Till at last, I'll be bound, I can thunder as loud,
papapappappapappax, as They.
So. Shalt thou then a sound so loud and profound
from thy belly diminutive send,
And shall not the high and the infinite Sky
go thundering on without end?
For both, you will find, on an impulse of wind
and similar causes depend.
St. Well, but tell me from Whom comes the bolt
through the gloom,
with its awful and terrible flashes;
And wherever it turns, some it singes and burns,
and some it reduces to ashes!
For this 'tis quite plain, let who will send the rain,
that Zeus against perjurers dashes.
So. And how, you old fool of a dark-ages school,
and an antediluvian wit,
If the perjured they strike, and not all men alike,
have they never Cleonymus hit?
Then of Simon again, and Theorus explain:
known perjurers, yet they escape.
But he smites his own shrine with his arrows
divine,
and "Sunium, Attica's cape,"
And the ancient gnarled oaks: now what prompted
those strokes? They never forswore, I should
say.
St. Can't say that they do: your words appear
true.
Whence comes then the thunderbolt, pray?
So. When a wind that is dry, being lifted on high,
is suddenly pent into these,
It swells up their skin, like a bladder, within,
by Necessity's changeless decrees:
Till, compressed very tight, it bursts them outright,
and away with an impulse so strong,
That at last by the force and the swing of its course,
it takes fire as it whizzes along.
St. That's exactly the thing that I suffered one
Spring,
at the great feast of Zeus, I admit:
I'd a paunch in the pot, but I wholly forgot
about making the safety-valve slit.
So it spluttered and swelled, while the saucepan I
held,
till at last with a vengeance it flew:
Took me quite by surprise, dung-bespattered my
eyes,
and scalded my face black and blue!
Ch. O thou who wouldst fain great wisdom attain,
and comest to us in thy need,
All Hellas around shall thy glory resound,
such a prosperous life thou shalt lead:
So thou art but endued with a memory good,
and accustomed profoundly to think,
And thy soul wilt inure all wants to endure,
and from no undertaking to shrink,
And art hardy and bold, to bear up against cold,
and with patience a supper thou losest:
Nor too much dost incline to gymnastics and wine,
but all lusts of the body refusest:
And esteemest it best, what is always the test
of a truly intelligent brain,
To prevail and succeed whensoever you plead,
and hosts of tongue-conquests to gain.
St. But as far as a sturdy soul is concerned
and a horrible restless care,
And a belly that pines and wears away
on the wretchedest, frugalest fare,
You may hammer and strike as long as you like;
I am quite invincible there.
So. Now then you agree in rejecting with me
the Gods you believed in when young,
And my creed you'll embrace "I believe in wide
space,
in the Clouds, in the eloquent Tongue."
St. If I happened to meet other Gods in the
street,
I'd show the cold shoulder, I vow.
No libation I'll pour: not one victim more
on their altars I'll sacrifice now.
Ch. Now be honest and true, and say what we
shall do:
since you never shall fail of our aid,
If you hold us most dear in devotion and fear,
and will ply the philosopher's trade.
St. O Ladies Divine, small ambition is mine:
I only most modestly seek,
Out and out for the rest of my life to be best
of the children of Hellas to speak.
Ch. Say no more of your care, we have granted
your prayer:
and know from this moment, that none
More acts shall pass through in the People than you:
such favour from us you have won.
St. Not acts, if you please: I want nothing of
these:
this gift you may quickly withdraw;
But I wish to succeed, just enough for my need,
and to slip through the clutches of law.
Ch. This then you shall do, for your wishes are
few:
not many nor great your demands,
So away with all care from henceforth, and prepare
to be placed in our votaries' hands.

# THE CLOUDS

437-455

St. This then will I do, confiding in you,
    for Necessity presses me sore,
And so sad is my life, ’twixt my debts and my wife,
    that I cannot put up with it more.
So now, at your word, I give and afford
My body to these, to treat as they please,
    To have and to hold, in squalor, in cold,
    In hunger and thirst, yea by Zeus, at the worst,
To be flayed out of shape from my heels to my
nape
So along with my hide from my duns I escape,
And to men may appear without conscience or
fear,
Bold, hasty, and wise, a concocter of lies,
A rattler to speak, a dodger, a sneak,
A regular claw of the tables of law,
A shuffler complete, well worn in deceit,
A supple, unprincipled, troublesome cheat;
A hang-dog accurst, a bore with the worst,
In the tricks of the jury-courts thoroughly versed.
If all that I meet this praise shall repeat,
Work away as you choose, I will nothing refuse,
Without any reserve, from my head to my shoes.
You shan’t see me wince though my gut you
mince,
And these entrails of mine for a sausage combine,
Served up for the gentlemen students to dine.

Ch. Here’s a spirit bold and high
    Ready-armed for any strife.
    *(to STREPSIADES)*
    If you learn what I can teach
    Of the mysteries of speech,
    Your glory soon shall reach To the summit of the
sky.

St. And what am I to gain?

Ch. With the Clouds you will obtain
    The most happy, the most enviable life.

St. Is it possible for me Such felicity to see?

Ch. Yes, and men shall come and wait
    In their thousands at your gate,
    Desiring consultations and advice
    On an action or a pleading
    From the man of light and leading,
    And you’ll pocket many talents in a trice.
    *(to SOCRATES)*
    Here, take the old man, and do all that you can,
    your new-fashioned thoughts to instil,
And stir up his mind with your notions refined,
    and test him with judgement and skill.

So. Come now, you tell me something of your
habits:
For if I don’t know them, I can’t determine
What engines I must bring to bear upon you.

St. Eh! what? Not going to storm me, by the
Gods?

So. No, no: I want to ask you a few questions.
First: is your memory good?

St. Two ways, by Zeus:
If I’m owed anything, I’m mindful, very:
But if I owe, (Oh dear!) forgetful, very.

So. Well then: have you the gift of speaking in
you?

486-526

St. The gift of speaking, no: of cheating, yes.

So. No? how then can you learn?

St. Oh, well enough.

So. Then when I throw you out some clever notion
About the laws of nature, you must catch it.

St. What! must I snap up sapience, in dog-fashion?

So. Oh! why the man’s an ignorant old savage:
I fear, my friend, that you’ll require the whip.
Come, if one strikes you, what do you do?

St. I’m struck:
Then in a little while I call my witness:
Then in another little while I summon him.

So. Put off your cloak.

St. Why, what have I done wrong?

So. O, nothing, nothing: all go in here naked.

St. Well, but I have not come with a search-
warrant.

So. Fool! throw it off.

St. Well, tell me this one thing;
If I’m extremely careful and attentive,
Which of your students shall I most resemble?

So. Why, Chaerephon. You’ll be his very image.

St. What! I shall be half-dead! O luckless me!

So. Don’t chatter there, but come and follow me;
Make haste now, quicker, here.

St. Oh, but do first
Give me a honied cake: Zeus! how I tremble,
To go down there, as if to see Trophonius.

So. Go on! why keep you pottering round the
door?

*Socrates and Strepsiades enter the Phrontisterion.*

Chorus
Yes! go, and farewell; as your courage is great,
So bright be your fate.
May all good fortune his steps pursue,
Who now, in his life’s dim twilight haze,
Is game such venturesome things to do,
To steep his mind in discoveries new,
To walk, a novice, in wisdom’s ways.

O Spectators, I will utter
honest truths with accents free,
Yea! by mighty Dionysus,
Him who bred and nurtured me.
So may I be deemed a poet,
and this day obtain the prize,
As till that unhappy blunder
I had always held you wise,
And of all my plays esteeming
this the wisest and the best,
Served it up for your enjoyment,
which had, more than all the rest,
Cost me thought, and time, and labour:
then most scandalously treated,
I retired in mighty dudgeon,
by unworthy foes defeated.
This is why I blame your critics,
for whose sake I framed the play:

559-594

Yet the clever ones amongst you
even now I won’t betray.
No! for ever since from judges
unto whom ’tis joy to speak,
Brothers Profligate and Modest
gained the praise we fondly seek,
When, for I was yet a Virgin,
and it was not right to bear,
I exposed it, and Another
did the foundling nurse with care.
But ’twas ye who nobly nurtured,
ye who brought it up with skill;
From that hour I proudly cherish
pledges of your sure good will.
Now then comes its sister hither,
like Electra in the Play,
Comes in earnest expectation
kindred minds to meet to-day;
She will recognize full surely,
if she find, her brother’s tress.
And observe how pure her morals:
who, to notice her first dress,
Enters not with filthy symbols
on her modest garments hung,
Jeering bald-heads, dancing ballets,
for the laughter of the young.

In this play no wretched greybeard
with a staff his fellow pokes,
So obscuring from the audience
all the poorness of his jokes.
No one rushes in with torches,
no one groans, “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”
Trusting in its genuine merits
comes this play before you here.
Yet, though such a hero-poet,
I, the bald-head, do not grow
Curling ringlets: neither do I
twice or thrice my pieces show.
Always fresh ideas sparkle,
always novel jests delight,
Nothing like each other, save that
all are most exceeding bright.

I am he who floored the giant,
Cleon, in his hour of pride,
Yet when down I scorned to strike him,
and I left him when he died!
But the others, when a handle
once Hyperbolus did lend,
Trample down the wretched caitiff,
and his mother, without end.

In his *Maricas the Drunkard*,
Eupolis the charge began,
Shamefully my *Knights* distorting,
as he is a shameful man,
Tacking on the tipsy beldame,
just the ballet-dance to keep,
Phrynichus’ prime invention,
eat by monsters of the deep.
Then Hermippus on the caitiff
opened all his little skill,
And the rest upon the caitiff
are their wit exhausting still;

527-558

And my simile to pilfer
“of the Eels” they all combine.
Whoso laughs at their productions,
let him not delight in mine.
But for you who praise my genius,
you who think my writings clever,
Ye shall gain a name for wisdom,
yea! forever and forever.

O mighty God, O heavenly King,
First unto Thee my prayer I bring,
O come, Lord Zeus, to my choral song;—
And Thou, dread Power, whose resistless hand
Heaves up the sea and the trembling land,
Lord of the trident, stern and strong;—
And Thou who sustainest the life of us all
Come, Ether, our parent, O come to my call;—
And Thou who floodest the world with light,
Guiding thy steeds through the glittering sky,
To men below and to Gods on high
A Potentate heavenly-bright!

O most sapient wise spectators,
hither turn attention due,
We complain of sad ill-treatment,
we’ve a bone to pick with you:
We have ever helped your city,
helped with all our might and main;
Yet you pay us no devotion,
that is why we now complain.
We who always watch around you.
For if any project seems
Ill-concocted, then we thunder,
then the rain comes down in streams.
And, remember, very lately,
how we knit our brows together,
“Thunders crashing, lightnings flashing,”
never was such awful weather;
And the Moon in haste eclipsed her,
and the Sun in anger swore
He would curl his wick within him
and give light to you no more,
Should you choose that mischief-worker,
Cleon, whom the Gods abhor,
Tanner, Slave, and Paphlagonian,
to lead out your hosts to war.
Yet you chose him! yet you chose him!
For they say that Folly grows
Best and finest in this city,
but the gracious Gods dispose
Always all things for the better,
causing errors to succeed:
And how this sad job may profit,
surely he who runs may read.
Let the Cormorant be convicted,
in command, of bribes and theft,
Let us have him gagged and muzzled,
in the pillory chained and left,
Then again, in ancient fashion,
all that ye have erred of late,
Will turn out your own advantage,
and a blessing to the State.

595-631

“Phoebus, my king, come to me still.”
Thou who holdest the Cynthian hill,
The lofty peak of the Delian isle;—
And Thou, his sister, to whom each day
Lydian maidens devoutly pray
In Thy stately gilded Ephesian pile;—
And Athene, our Lady, the queen of us all,
With the Aegis of God, O come to my call;—
And Thou whose dancing torches of pine
Flicker, Parnassian glades along,
Dionysus, Star of Thy Maenad throng,
Come, Reveller most divine!

We, when we had finished packing,
and prepared our journey down,
Met the Lady Moon, who charged us
with a message for your town.
First, All hail to noble Athens,
and her faithful true Allies;
Then, she said, your shameful conduct
made her angry passions rise,
Treating her so ill who always
aids you, not in words, but clearly;
Saves you, first of all, in torchlight
every month a drachma nearly,

So that each one says, if business
calls him out from home by night,
“Buy no link, my boy, this evening,
for the Moon will lend her light.”
Other blessings too she sends you,
yet you will not mark your days
As she bids you, but confuse them,
jumbling them all sorts of ways,
And, she says, the Gods in chorus
shower reproaches on her head,
When in bitter disappointment
they go supperless to bed,
Not obtaining festal banquets
duly on the festal day;
Ye are badgering in the law-courts
when ye should arise and slay!
And full oft when we celestials
some strict fast are duly keeping,
For the fate of mighty Memnon,
or divine Sarpedon weeping,
Then you feast and pour libations:
and Hyperbolus of late
Lost the crown he wore so proudly
as Recorder of the Gate,
Through the wrath of us immortals:
so perchance he’ll rather know
Always all his days in future
by the Lady Moon to go.

*Socrates here comes out of the Phrontisterion where he has been endeavouring to teach STREPSIADES.*

So. Never by Chaos, Air, and Respiration,
Never, no never have I seen a clown
So helpless, and forgetful, and absurd!
Why if he learns a quirk or two he clean
Forgets them ere he has learnt them: all the same,

632-674

I’ll call him out of doors here to the light.
Take up your bed, Strepsiades, and come!

St. By Zeus, I can’t: the bugs make such resistance.

So. Make haste. There, throw it down, and
listen.

St. *(entering, with bed)* Well!

So. Attend to me: what shall I teach you first
That you’ve not learnt before? Which will you
have,
Measures or rhythms or the right use of words?

St. Oh! measures to be sure: for very lately
A grocer swindled me of full three pints.

So. I don’t mean that: but which do you like the
best
Of all the measures; six feet, or eight feet?

St. Well, I like nothing better than the yard.

So. Fool! don’t talk nonsense.

St. What will you bet me now
That two yards don’t exactly make six feet?

So. Consume you! what an ignorant clown you
are!
Still, perhaps you can learn tunes more easily.

St. But will tunes help me to repair my
fortunes?

So. They’ll help you to behave in company:
If you can tell which kind of tune is best
For the sword-dance, and which for finger music.

St. For fingers! aye, but I know that.

So. Say on, then.

St. What is it but this finger? though before,
Ere this was grown, I used to play with that.

So. Insufferable dolt!

St. Well but, you goose,
I don’t want to learn this.

So. What do you want then?

St. Teach me the Logic! teach me the unjust
Logic!

So. But you must learn some other matters first:
As, what are males among the quadrupeds.

St. I should be mad indeed not to know that.
The Ram, the Bull, the Goat, the Dog, the Fowl.

So. Ah! there you are! there’s a mistake at once!
You call the male and female fowl the same.

St. How! tell me how.

So. Why fowl and fowl of course.

St. That’s true though! what then shall I say in
future?

So. Call one a fowless and the other a fowl.

St. A fowless? Good! Bravo! Bravo! by Air.
Now for that one bright piece of information
I’ll give you a barley bumper in your trough.

So. Look there, a fresh mistake; you called it
trough,
Masculine, when it’s feminine.

St. How, pray?
How did I make it masculine?

So. Why “trough,”
Just like “Cleonymus.”

St. I don’t quite catch it.

So. Why “trough,” “Cleonymus,” both masculine.

675-723

St. Ah, but Cleonymus has got no trough,
His bread is kneaded in a rounded mortar:
Still, what must I say in future?

So. What! why call it
A “troughess,” female, just as one says “an
actress.”

St. A “troughess,” female?

So. That’s the way to call it.

St. O “troughess” then and Miss Cleonymus.

So. Still you must learn some more about these
names;
Which are the names of men and which of women.

St. Oh, I know which are women.

So. Well, repeat some.

St. Demetria, Cleitagora, Philinna.

So. Now tell me some men’s names.

St. O yes, ten thousand.
Philon, Melesias, Amynias.

So. Hold! I said men’s names: these are women’s
names.

St. No, no, they’re men’s.

So. They are not men’s, for how
Would you address Amynias if you met him?

St. How? somehow thus. “Here, here, Amynia!”

So. Amynia! a woman’s name, you see.

St. And rightly too; a sneak who shirks all
service!
But all know this: let’s pass to something else.

So. Well, then, you get into the bed.

St. And then?

So. Excogitate about your own affairs.

St. Not there: I do beseech, not there: at least
Let me excogitate on the bare ground.

So. There is no way but this.

St. O luckless me!
How I shall suffer from the bugs today.

So. Now then survey in every way,
with airy judgement sharp and quick:
Wrapping thoughts around you thick:
And if so be in one you stick,
Never stop to toil and bother,
Lightly, lightly, lightly leap,
To another, to another;
Far away be balmy sleep.

St. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

Ch. What’s the matter? where’s the pain?

St. Friends! I’m dying. From the bed
Out creep bugbears scantily fed.
And my ribs they bite in twain,
And my life-blood out they suck,
And my manhood off they pluck,
And my loins they dig and drain,
And I’m dying, once again.

Ch. O take not the smart so deeply to heart.

St. Why, what can I do?
Vanished my skin so ruddy of hue,
Vanished my life-blood, vanished my shoe,
Vanished my purse, and what is still worse
As I hummed an old tune till my watch should
be past,
I had very near vanished myself at the last.

So. Hallo there, are you pondering?

723-765
Eh! what? I?
Yes to be sure.

So. And what have your ponderings come to?

St. Whether these bugs will leave a bit of me.

So. Consume you, wretch!

St. Faith, I’m consumed already.

So. Come, come, don’t flinch: pull up the
clothes again:
Search out and catch some very subtle dodge
To fleece your creditors.

St. O me, how can I
Fleece any one with all these fleeces on me?

*(Puts his head under the clothes.)*

So. Come, let me peep a moment what he’s doing.
Hey! he’s asleep!

St. No, no! no fear of that!

So. Caught anything?

St. No, nothing.

So. Surely, something.

St. Well, I had something in my hand, I’ll own.

So. Pull up the clothes again, and go on pondering.

St. On what? now do please tell me, Socrates.

So. What is it that you want? first tell me that.

St. You have heard a million times what ’tis I
want:
My debts! my debts! I want to shirk my debts.

So. Come, come, pull up the clothes: refine your
thoughts
With subtle wit: look at the case on all sides:
Mind you divide correctly.

St. Ugh! O me.

So. Hush: if you meet with any difficulty
Leave it a moment: then return again
To the same thought: then lift and weigh it well.

St. Oh, here, dear Socrates!

So. Well, my old friend.

St. I’ve found a notion how to shirk my debts.

So. Well then, propound it.

St. What do you think of this?
Suppose I hire some grand Thessalian witch
To conjure down the Moon, and then I take it
And clap it into some round helmet-box,
And keep it fast there, like a looking-glass,—

So. But what’s the use of that?

St. The use, quotha:
Why if the Moon should never rise again.
I’d never pay one farthing.

So. No! why not?

St. Why, don’t we pay our interest by the
month?

So. Good! now I’ll proffer you another problem.
Suppose an action: damages, five talents:
Now tell me how you can evade that same.

St. How! how! can’t say at all: but I’ll go seek.

766-810

So. Don’t wrap your mind for ever round
yourself,
But let your thoughts range freely through the air,
Like chafers with a thread about their feet.

St. I’ve found a bright evasion of the action:
Confess yourself, ’tis glorious.

So. But what is it?

St. I say, haven’t you seen in druggists’ shops
That stone, that splendidly transparent stone,
By which they kindle fire?

So. The burning-glass?

St. That’s it: well then. I’d get me one of these,
And as the clerk was entering down my case,
I’d stand, like this, some distance towards the sun,
And burn out every line.

So. By the Three Graces,
A clever dodge!

St. O me, how pleased I am
To have a debt like that clean blotted out.

So. Come, then, make haste and snap up this.

St. Well, what?

So. How to prevent an adversary’s suit
Supposing you were sure to lose it; tell me.

St. O, nothing easier.

So. How, pray?

St. Why thus,
While there was yet one trial intervening,
Ere mine was cited. I’d go hang myself.

So. Absurd!

St. No, by the Gods, it isn’t though:
They could not prosecute me were I dead.

So. Nonsense! Be off: I’ll try no more to teach
you.

St. Why not? do, please: now, please do,
Socrates.

So. Why you forget all that you learn, directly.
Come, say what you learnt first: there’s a chance
for you.

St. Ah! what was first?—Dear me: whatever was
it?—
Whatever’s that we knead the barley in?—
Bless us, what was it?

So. Be off, and feed the crows,
You most forgetful, most absurd old dolt!

St. O me! what will become of me, poor wretch!
I’m clean undone: I haven’t learnt to speak.—
O gracious Clouds, now do advise me something.

Ch. Our counsel, ancient friend, is simply this,
To send your son, if you have one at home,
And let him learn this wisdom in your stead.

St. Yes! I’ve a son, quite a fine gentleman:
But he won’t learn, so what am I to do?

Ch. What! is he master?

St. Well: he’s strong and vigorous,
And he’s got some of the Coesyra blood within
him:
Still I’ll go for him, and if he won’t come
By all the Gods I’ll turn him out of doors.
Go in one moment, I’ll be back directly.

*Socrates exits to Phrontisterion, and Strepsiades to his house.*

811-853

Ch. Dost thou not see how bounteous we our
favours free
Will shower on you,
Since whatsoe’er your will prepare
This dupe will do.
But now that you have dazzled and
elated so your man,
Make haste and seize whate’er you please
as quickly as you can,
For cases such as these, my friend,
are very prone to change and bend.

*Enter STREPSIADES and PHEIDIPPIDES.*

St. Get out! you shan’t stop here: so help me
Mist!
Be off, and eat up Megacles’ columns.

Ph. How now, my father? what’s i’ the wind today?
You’re wandering; by Olympian Zeus, you are.

St. Look there! Olympian Zeus! you blockhead
you,
Come to your age, and yet believe in Zeus!

Ph. Why prithee, what’s the joke?

St. ’Tis so preposterous
When babes like you hold antiquated notions.
But come and I’ll impart a thing or two,
A wrinkle, making you a man indeed.
But, mind: don’t whisper this to any one.

Ph. Well, what’s the matter?

St. Didn’t you swear by Zeus?

Ph. I did.

St. See now, how good a thing is learning.
There is no Zeus, Pheidippides

Ph. Who then?

St. Why Vortex reigns, and he has turned out
Zeus.

Ph. Oh me, what stuff.

St. Be sure that this is so.

Ph. Who says so, pray?

St. The Melian—Socrates,
And Chaerephon, who knows about the flea-
tracks.

Ph. And are you come to such a pitch of madness
As to put faith in brain-struck men?

St. Oh, hush!
And don’t blaspheme such very dexterous men
And sapient too: men of such frugal habits
They never shave, nor use your precious ointment,
Nor go to baths to clean themselves: but you
Have taken me for a corpse and cleaned me out.
Come, come, make haste, do go and learn for me.

Ph. What can one learn from them that is worth
knowing?

St. Learn! why, whatever’s clever in the world:
And you shall learn how gross and dense you are.
But stop one moment: I’ll be back directly. *Exit.*

Ph. O me! what must I do with my mad father?
Shall I indict him for his lunacy,
Or tell the undertakers of his symptoms?

St. *(re-entering)* Now then! you see this, don’t
you? what do you call it?

Ph. That? why a fowl.

St. Good! now then, what is this?

Ph. That’s a fowl too.

St. What both! Ridiculous!
Never say that again, but mind you always
Call this a fowless and the other a fowl.

Ph. A fowless! These then are the mighty secrets
You have picked up amongst those earth-born
fellows.

854-895

St. And lots besides: but everything I learn
I straight forget: I am so old and stupid.

Ph. And this is what you have lost your mantle
for?

St. It’s very absent sometimes: ’tisn’t lost.

Ph. And what have you done with your shoes,
you dotard you?

St. Like Pericles, all for the best, I’ve lost them.
Come, come; go with me: humour me in this,
And then do what you like. Ah! I remember
How I to humour you, a coaxing baby,
With the first obol which my judgeship fetched me
Bought you a go-cart at the great Diasia.

Ph. The time will come when you’ll repent of
this.

St. Good boy to obey me. Hallo! Socrates.

*Enter SOCRATES.*

Come here; come here; I’ve brought this son of
mine,
Trouble enough, I’ll warrant you.

So. Poor infant,
Not yet aware of my suspension-wonders.

Ph. You’d make a wondrous piece of ware,
suspended.

St. Hey! Hang the lad! Do you abuse the
Master?

So. And look, “suspended!” In what foolish
fashion
He mouthed the word with pouting lips agape.
How can he learn evasion of a suit,
Timely citation, damaging replies?
Hyperbolus, though, learnt them for a talent.

St. O never fear! he’s very sharp, by nature.
For when he was a little chap, so high,
He used to build small baby-houses, boats,
Go-carts of leather, darling little frogs
Carved from pomegranates, you can’t think how
nicely!
So now, I prithee, teach him both your Logics,
The Better, as you call it, and the Worse
Which with the worse cause can defeat the Better;
Or if not both, at all events the Worse.

So. Aye, with his own ears he shall hear them
argue.
I shan’t be there.

St. But please remember this,
Give him the knack of reasoning down all Justice.

*Exit SOCRATES.*
*Enter RIGHT LOGIC and WRONG LOGIC.*

896-938

R.L. Come show yourself now
    with your confident brow.
    — To the stage, if you dare!

W.L. “Lead on where you please”:
    I shall smash you with ease,
    If an audience be there.

R.L. You'll smash me, you say! And who are you,
    pray?

W.L. A Logic, like you.

R.L. But the Worst of the two.

W.L. Yet you I can drub whom my Better they
    dub.

R.L. By what artifice taught?

W.L. By original thought.

R.L. Aye, truly your trade so successful is made.
    By means of these noodles of ours, I’m afraid.

W.L. Not noodles, but wise.

R.L. I’ll smash you and your lies!

W.L. By what method, forsooth?

R.L. By speaking the Truth.

W.L. Your words I will meet, and entirely defeat:
    There never was Justice or Truth, I repeat.

R.L. No Justice! you say?

W.L. Well, where does it stay?

R.L. With the Gods in the air.

W.L. If Justice be there,
    How comes it that Zeus could his father reduce,
    Yet live with their Godships unpunished and
    loose?

R.L. Ugh! Ugh! These evils come thick,
    I feel awfully sick,
    A basin, quick, quick!

W.L. You’re a useless old drone with one foot in
    the grave!

R.L. You’re a shameless, unprincipled, dissolute
    knave!

W.L. Hey! a rosy festoon.

R.L. And a vulgar buffoon!

W.L. What! Lilies from you!

R.L. And a parricide too!

W.L. ’Tis with gold (you don’t know it) you
    sprinkle my head.

R.L. O gold is it now? but it used to be lead!

W.L. But now it’s a grace and a glory instead.

R.L. You’re a little too bold.

W.L. You’re a good deal too old.

R.L. ’Tis through you I well know not a stripling
    will go
    To attend to the rules which are taught in the
    Schools;
    But Athens one day shall be up to the fools.

W.L. How squalid your dress!

R.L. Yours is fine, I confess.
    Yet of old, I declare, but a pauper you were;
    And passed yourself off, our compassion to draw
    As a Telephus, (*Euripidean*)
    Well pleased from a beggarly wallet to gnaw
    At inanities Pandeletean.

W.L. O me! for the wisdom you’ve mentioned in
    jest!

R.L. O me! for the folly of you, and the rest
    Who you to destroy their children employ!

W.L. Him you never shall teach: you are quite
    out of date.

R.L. If not, he’ll be lost, as he’ll find to his cost:
    Taught nothing by you but to chatter and prate.

W.L. He raves, as you see: let him be, let him be.

R.L. Touch him if you dare! I bid you beware.

Ch. Forbear, forbear to wrangle and scold!
    Each of you show
    You what you taught their fathers of old,
    You let us know
    Your system untried, that hearing each side
    From the lips of the Rivals the youth may decide
    To which of your schools he will go.

939-981

R.L. This then will I do.

W.L. And so will I too.

Ch. And who will put in his claim to begin?

W.L. If he wishes, he may: I kindly give way:
    And out of his argument quickly will I
    Draw facts and devices to fledge the reply
    Wherewith I will shoot him and smite and refute
    him.
    And at last if a word from his mouth shall be heard
    My sayings like fierce savage hornets shall pierce
    His forehead and eyes,
    Till in fear and distraction he yields and he—dies!

Ch. With thoughts and words and maxims
    pondered well
    Now then in confidence let both begin:
    Try which his rival can in speech excel:
    Try which this perilous wordy war can win,
    Which all my votaries’ hopes are fondly centred in.
    O Thou who wert born our sires to adorn
    with characters blameless and fair,
    Say on what you please, say on and to these
    your glorious Nature declare.

R.L. To hear then prepare of the Discipline rare
    which flourished in Athens of yore
    When Honour and Truth were in fashion with youth
    and Sobriety bloomed on our shore;
    First of all the old rule was preserved in our school
    that “boys should be seen and not heard”:
    And then to the home of the Harpist would come

decorous in action and word
All the lads of one town, though the snow peppered down,
In spite of all wind and all weather:
And they sang an old song as they paced it along,
Not shambling with thighs glued together:
“O the dread shout of War how it peals from afar,”
Or “Pallas the Stormer adore,”
To some manly old air all simple and bare
Which their fathers had chanted before.
And should anyone dare the tune to impair
And with intricate twistings to fill,
Such as *Phrynis* is fain, and his long-winded train,
Perversely to quaver and trill,
Many stripes would he feel in return for his zeal,
As to genuine Music a foe.
And every one’s thigh was forward and high
As they sat to be drilled in a row,
So that nothing the while indecent or vile
The eye of a stranger might meet;
And then with their hand they would smooth down the sand
Whenever they rose from their seat,
To leave not a trace of themselves in the place
For a vigilant lover to view.
They never would soil their persons with oil
But were inartificial and true.
Nor tempered their throat to a soft mincing note
And sighs to their lovers addressed:
Nor laid themselves out, as they strutted about,
To the wanton desires of the rest:
Nor would anyone dare such stimulant fare
As the head of the radish to wish:
Nor to make over bold with the food of the old,
The anise, and parsley, and fish:
Nor dainties to quaff, nor giggle and laugh,
Nor foot within foot to enfold.

**Worse Logic:** Faugh! this smells very strong of some musty old song,
And Chirrupers mounted in gold;
And Slaughter of beasts, and old-fashioned feasts.

**Better Logic:** Yet these are the precepts which taught
The heroes of old to be hardy and bold,
And the Men who at Marathon fought!
But now must the lad from his boyhood be clad
In a Man’s all-enveloping cloak:
So that, oft as the Panathenaea returns,
I feel myself ready to choke
When the dancers go by with their shields to their thigh,
Not caring for Pallas a jot.
You therefore, young man, choose me while you can;
Cast in with my Method your lot;
And then you shall learn the forum to spurn,
And from dissolute baths to abstain,
And fashions impure and shameful abjure,
And scorners repel with disdain:
And rise from your chair if an elder be there,
And respectfully give him your place,
And with love and with fear your parents revere,
And shrink from the brand of Disgrace,
And deep in your breast be the Image impressed
Of Modesty, simple and true,
Nor resort any more to a dancing-girl’s door,
Nor glance at the harlotry crew,
Lest at length by the blow of the Apple they throw
From the hopes of your Manhood you fall.
Nor dare to reply when your Father is nigh,
Nor “musty old Japhet” to call
In your malice and rage that Sacred Old Age
Which lovingly cherished your youth.

**Worse Logic:** Yes, yes, my young friend, if to him you attend,
By Bacchus I swear of a truth
You will scarce with the sty of *Hippocrates* vie,
As a mammy-suck known even there!

**Better Logic:** But then you’ll excel in the games you love well,
All blooming, athletic and fair:
Not learning to prate as your idlers debate
With marvellous prickly dispute,
Nor dragged into Court day by day to make sport
In some small disagreeable suit:
But you will below to the Academe go,
And under the olives contend
With your chaplet of reed, in a contest of speed
With some excellent rival and friend:
All fragrant with woodbine and peaceful content,
And the leaf which the lime blossoms fling,
When the plane whispers love to the elm in the grove
In the beautiful season of Spring.
If then you’ll obey and do what I say,
And follow with me the more excellent way,
Your chest shall be white, your skin shall be bright,
Your arms shall be tight, your tongue shall be slight,
And everything else shall be proper and right.
But if you pursue what men nowadays do,
You will have, to begin, a cold pallid skin,
Arms small and chest weak, tongue practised to speak,
Special laws very long, and the symptoms all strong
Which show that your life is licentious and wrong.
And your mind he’ll prepare so that foul to be fair
And fair to be foul you shall always declare;
And you’ll find yourself soon, if you listen to him,
With the filth of *Antimachus* filled to the brim!

**Chorus:** O glorious Sage! with loveliest Wisdom teeming!
Sweet on thy words does ancient Virtue rest!
Thrice happy they who watched thy Youth’s bright beaming!
Thou of the vaunted genius, do thy best;
This man has gained applause: His Wisdom stands confessed.
And you with clever words and thoughts must needs your case adorn
Else he will surely win the day, and you retreat with scorn.

**Worse Logic:** Aye, say you so? why I have been half-burst; I do so long
To overthrow his arguments with arguments more strong.
I am the Lesser Logic? True: these Schoolmen call me so,
Simply because I was the first of all mankind to show
How old established rules and laws might contradicted be:
And this, as you may guess, is worth a thousand pounds to me,
To take the feebler cause, and yet to win the disputation.
And mark me now, how I’ll confute his boasted Education!
You said that always from warm baths the stripling must abstain:
Why must he? on what grounds do you of these warm baths complain?

**Better Logic:** Why, it’s the worst thing possible, it quite unstrings a man.

**Worse Logic:** Hold there: I’ve got you round the waist: escape me if you can.
And first: of all the sons of Zeus which think you was the best?
Which was the manliest? which endured more toils than all the rest?

**Better Logic:** Well, I suppose that *Heracles* was bravest and most bold.

**Worse Logic:** And are the baths of *Heracles* so wonderfully cold?
Aha! you blame warm baths, I think.

**Better Logic:** This, this is what they say:
This is the stuff our precious youths are chattering all the day!
This is what makes them haunt the baths, and shun the manlier Games!

**Worse Logic:** Well then, we’ll take the Forum next: I praise it, and he blames.
But if it was so bad, do you think old *Homer* would have made
*Nestor* and all his worthies ply a real forensic trade?
Well: then he says a stripling’s tongue should always idle be:
I say it should be used of course: so there we disagree.
And next he says you must be chaste. A most preposterous plan!
Come, tell me did you ever know one single blessed man
Gain the least good by chastity? come, prove I’m wrong: make haste.

**Better Logic:** Yes, many, many! *Peleus* gained a sword by being chaste.

**Worse Logic:** A sword indeed! a wondrous meed the unlucky fool obtained.
*Hyperbolus* the Lamp-maker hath many a talent gained
By knavish tricks which I have taught: but not a sword, no, no!

**Better Logic:** Then *Peleus* did to his chaste life the bed of *Thetis* owe.

**Worse Logic:** And then she cut and ran away! for nothing so engages
A woman’s heart as forward warmth, old shred of those dark Ages!
For take this chastity, young man: sift it inside and out:
Count all the pleasures, all the joys, it bids you live without:
No kind of dames, no kind of games, no laughing, feasting, drinking —
Why, life itself is little worth without these joys, I’m thinking.
Well, I must notice now the wants by Nature’s self implanted;
You love, seduce, you can’t help that, you’re caught, convicted. Granted.
You’re done for; you can’t say one word: while if you follow me
Indulge your genius, laugh and quaff, hold nothing base to be.
Why if you’re in adultery caught, your pleas will still be ample:
You’ve done no wrong, you’ll say, and then bring Zeus as your example.
He fell before the wondrous powers by Love and Beauty wielded:
And how can you, the Mortal, stand, where He, the Immortal, yielded?

**Better Logic:** Aye, but suppose in spite of all, he must be wedged and sanded. [1]
Won’t he be probed, or else can you prevent it? now be candid.

**Worse Logic:** And what’s the damage if it should be so?

**Better Logic:** What greater damage can the young man know?

**Worse Logic:** What will you do, if this dispute I win?

**Better Logic:** I’ll be for ever silent.

**Worse Logic:** Good, begin.
The Counsellor: from whence comes he?

**Better Logic:** From probed adulterers.

**Worse Logic:** I agree.
The Tragic Poets: whence are they?

**Better Logic:** From probed adulterers.

**Worse Logic:** So I say.
The Orators: what class of men?

**Better Logic:** All probed adulterers.

**Worse Logic:** Right again.
You feel your error, I’ll engage,
But look once more around the stage,
Survey the audience, which they be,
Probed or not Probed.

**Better Logic:** I see, I see.

**Worse Logic:** Well, give your verdict.

**Better Logic:** It must go
For probed adulterers: him I know,
And him, and him: the Probed are most.

**Worse Logic:** How stand we then?

**Better Logic:** I own, I’ve lost.
O *Cinaeds*, *Cinaeds*, take my robe!
Your words have won, to you I run
To live and die with glorious Probe!

*(The two logics go out, and enter Socrates from the Phrontisterion and Strepsiades from his own house to see how his son's education has been progressing. During the interval of the chorus (1114-1130) that education is supposed to be completed.)*

**Socrates:** Well, what do you want? to take away your son
At once, or shall I teach him how to speak?

**Strepsiades:** Teach him, and flog him, and be sure you well
Sharpen his mother wit, grind the one edge
Fit for my little law-suits, and the other,
Why, make that serve for more important matters.

**Socrates:** Oh, never fear! He’ll make a splendid sophist.

**Strepsiades:** Well, well, I hope he’ll be a poor pale rascal.

**Chorus:** Go: but in us the thought is strong,
You will repent of this ere long.
Now we wish to tell the Judges
All the blessings they shall gain
If, as Justice plainly warrants,
We the worthy prize obtain.
First, whenever in the Season
Ye would fain your fields renew,
All the world shall wait expectant
Till we’ve poured our rain on you:
Then of all your crops and vineyards
We will take the utmost care
So that neither drought oppress them,
Nor the heavy rain impair.
But if anyone amongst you
Dare to treat our claims with scorn,
Mortal he, the Clouds immortal,
Better had he ne’er been born!
He from his estates shall gather
Neither corn, nor oil, nor wine,
For whenever blossoms sparkle
On the olive or the vine
They shall all at once be blighted:
We will ply our slings so true.
And if ever we behold him
Building up his mansions new,
With our tight and nipping hailstones
We will all his tiles destroy.
But if he, his friends or kinsfolk,
Would a marriage-feast enjoy,
All night long we’ll pour in torrents:
So perchance he’ll rather pray
To endure the drought of Egypt,
Than decide amiss to-day!

**Strepsiades:** The fifth, the fourth, the third, and then the second,
And then that day which more than all the rest
I loathe and shrink from and abominate,
Then comes at once that hateful Old-and-New day.
And every single blessed dun has sworn
He’ll stake his gage, and ruin and destroy me.
And when I make a modest small request,
“O my good friend, part don’t exact at present,
And part defer, and part remit,” they swear
So they shall never touch it, and abuse me
As a rank swindler, threatening me with actions.
Now let them bring their actions! Who’s afraid?
Not I: if these have taught my son to speak.
But here’s the door: I’ll knock and soon find out.
Boy! Ho there, boy!

**Socrates:** I clasp Strepsiades.

**Strepsiades:** And I clasp you: but take this meal-bag first.
’Tis meet and right to glorify one’s Tutors.
But tell me, tell me, has my son yet learnt
That Second Logic which he saw just now?

**Socrates:** He hath.

**Strepsiades:** Hurrah! great Sovereign Knavery!

**Socrates:** You may escape whatever suit you please.

**Strepsiades:** What, if I borrowed before witnesses?

**Socrates:** Before a thousand, and the more the merrier.

**Strepsiades:** “Then shall my song be loud and deep.”
Weep, obol-weighers, weep, weep, weep,
Ye, and your principals, and compound interests,
For ye shall never pester me again.
Such a son have I bred,
(He is within this door),
Born to inspire my foemen with dread,
Born his old father’s house to restore:
Keen and polished of tongue is he,
He my Champion and Guard shall be,
He will set his old father free,
Run you, and call him forth to me.
“O my child! O my sweet! come out, I entreat;
’Tis the voice” of your sire.

**Socrates:** Here’s the man you require.

**Strepsiades:** Joy, joy of my heart!

**Socrates:** Take your son and depart.

**Strepsiades:** O come, O come, my son, my son,
O dear! O dear!
O joy, to see your beautiful complexion!
Aye now you have an aspect Negative
And Disputative, and our native query
Shines forth there “What d’ye say?” You’ve the true face
Which rogues put on, of injured innocence.
You have the regular Attic look about you.
So now, you save me, for ’twas you undid me.

**Pheidippides:** What is it ails you?

**Strepsiades:** Why the Old-and-New day.

**Pheidippides:** And is there such a day as Old-and-New?

**Strepsiades:** Yes: that’s the day they mean to stake their gages.

**Pheidippides:** They’ll lose them if they stake them. What! do you think
That one day can be two days, both together?

**Strepsiades:** Why, can’t it be so?

**Pheidippides:** Surely not; or else
A woman might at once be old and young.

**Strepsiades:** Still, the law says so.

**Pheidippides:** True: but I believe
They don’t quite understand it.

**Strepsiades:** You explain it.

**Pheidippides:** Old *Solon* had a democratic turn.

**Strepsiades:** Well, but that’s nothing to the Old-and-New.

**Pheidippides:** Hence then he fixed that summonses be issued
For these two days, the old one and the new one,
So that the gage be staked on the New-month.

**Strepsiades:** What made him add “the old” then?

**Pheidippides:** I will tell you.
He wished the litigants to meet on that day
And compromise their quarrels: if they could not,
Then let them fight it out on the New-month.

**Strepsiades:** Why then do Magistrates receive the stakes
On the Old-and-New instead of the New-month?

**Pheidippides:** Well, I believe they act like the Foretasters.
They wish to bag the gage as soon as possible,
And thus they gain a whole day’s foretaste of it.

**Strepsiades:** Aha! poor dupes, why sit ye mooning there,
Game for us Artful Dodgers, you dull stones,
You ciphers, lambkins, butts piled up together!
Oh! my success inspires me, and I’ll sing
Glad eulogies on me and thee, my son.
“Man, most blessed, most divine,
What a wondrous wit is thine,
What a son to grace thy fine,”
Friends and neighbours day by day
Thus will say,
When with envious eyes my suits they see you win:
But first I’ll feast you, so come in, my son, come in.

*(Enter Pasias and his witness.)*

**Pasias:** What! must a man lose his own property!
No: never, never. Better have refused
With a bold face, than be so plagued as this.
See! to get paid my own just debts, I’m forced
To drag you to bear witness, and what’s worse
I needs must quarrel with my townsman here.
Well, I won’t shame my country, while I live,
I’ll go to law, I’ll summon him.

**Strepsiades:** *(entering)* Hallo!

**Pasias:** To the next Old-and-New.

**Strepsiades:** Bear witness, all!
He named two days. You’ll summon me; what for?

**Pasias:** The fifty pounds I lent you when you bought
That iron-grey.

**Strepsiades:** Just listen to the fellow!
The whole world knows that I detest all horses.

**Pasias:** I swear you swore by all the Gods to pay me.

**Strepsiades:** Well, now I swear I won’t: *Pheidippides*
Has learnt since then the unanswerable Logic.

**Pasias:** And will you therefore shirk my just demand?

**Strepsiades:** Of course I will: else why should he have learnt it?

**Pasias:** And will you dare forswear it by the Gods?

**Strepsiades:** The Gods indeed! What Gods?

**Pasias:** Poseidon, Hermes, Zeus.

**Strepsiades:** By Zeus I would,
Though I gave twopence halfpenny for the privilege.

**Pasias:** O then confound you for a shameless rogue!

**Strepsiades:** Hallo! this butt should be rubbed down with salt.

**Pasias:** Zounds! you deride me!

**Strepsiades:** Why ’twill hold four gallons.

**Pasias:** You ’scape me not, by Mighty Zeus, and all
The Gods!

**Strepsiades:** I wonderfully like the Gods;
An oath by Zeus is sport to knowing ones.

**Pasias:** Sooner or later you’ll repent of this.
Come do you mean to pay your debts or don’t you?
Tell me, and I’ll be off.

**Strepsiades:** Now do have patience;
I’ll give you a clear answer in one moment.

**Pasias:** What do you think he’ll do?

**Witness:** I think he’ll pay you.

**Strepsiades:** Where is that horrid dun? O here: now tell me
What you call this.

**Pasias:** What I call that? a trough.

**Strepsiades:** Heavens! what a fool: and do you want your money?
I’d never pay one penny to a fellow
Who calls my troughless, trough. So there’s your answer.

**Pasias:** Then you won’t pay me?

**Strepsiades:** No, not if I know it.
Come put your best foot forward, and be off:
March off, I say, this instant!

**Pasias:** May I die
If I don’t go at once and stake my gage!

*(Exit Pasias.)*

**Strepsiades:** No don’t: the fifty pounds are loss enough:
And really on my word I would not wish you
To lose this too just for one silly blunder.

*(Enter Amynias.)*

**Amynias:** Ah me! Oh! Oh! Oh!

**Strepsiades:** Hallo! who’s that making that horrible noise?
Not one of *Carcinus’* snivelling Gods?

**Amynias:** Who cares to know what I am? what imports it?
An ill-starred man.

**Strepsiades:** Then keep it to yourself.

**Amynias:** “O heavy fate!” “O Fortune, thou hast broken
My chariot wheels!” “Thou hast undone me, Pallas!”

**Strepsiades:** How! has *Tlepolemus* been at you, man?

**Amynias:** Jeer me not, friend, but tell your worthy son
To pay me back the money which I lent him:
I’m in a bad way and the times are pressing.

**Strepsiades:** What money do you mean?

**Amynias:** Why what he borrowed.

**Strepsiades:** You are in a bad way, I really think.

**Amynias:** Driving my four-wheel out I fell, by Zeus.

**Strepsiades:** You rave as if you’d fall’n times out-of-mind.

**Amynias:** I rave? how so? I only claim my own.

**Strepsiades:** You can’t be quite right, surely.

**Amynias:** Why, what mean you?

**Strepsiades:** I shrewdly guess your brain’s received a shake.

**Amynias:** I shrewdly guess that you’ll receive a summons
If you don’t pay my money.

**Strepsiades:** Well, then, tell me,
Which theory do you side with, that the rain
Falls fresh each time, or that the Sun draws back
The same old rain, and sends it down again?

**Amynias:** I’m very sure I neither know nor care.

**Strepsiades:** Not care! good heavens! and do you claim your money,
So unenlightened in the Laws of Nature?

**Amynias:** If you’re hard up then, pay me back the Int-er-est
At least.

**Strepsiades:** Int-er-est? what kind of a beast is that?

**Amynias:** What else than day by day and month by month
Larger and larger still the silver grows
As time sweeps by?

**Strepsiades:** Finely and nobly said.
What then! think you the Sea is larger now
Than ’twas last year?

**Amynias:** No surely, ’tis no larger:
It is not right it should be.

**Strepsiades:** And do you then,
Insatiable grasper! when the Sea,
Receiving all these Rivers, grows no larger,
Do you desire your silver to grow larger?
Come now, you prosecute your journey off!
Here, fetch the whip.

**Amynias:** Bear witness, I appeal.

**Strepsiades:** Be off! what, won’t you? Gee up, sigma-brand!

**Amynias:** I say! a clear assault!

**Strepsiades:** You won’t be off?
I’ll stimulate you; Zeus! I’ll goad your haunches.

*(Exit Amynias.)*

**Strepsiades:** Aha! you run: I thought I’d stir you up
You and your phaetons, and wheels, and all!

*(Exit Strepsiades.)*

**Chorus:** What a thing it is to long for matters which are wrong!
For you see how this old man
Is seeking, if he can
His creditors trepan:
And I confidently say
That he will this very day
Such a blow
Amid his prosperous cheats receive,
That he will deeply deeply grieve.
For I think that he has won what he wanted for his son,
And the lad has learned the way
All justice to gainsay,
Be it what or where it may:
That he’ll trump up any tale,
Right or wrong, and so prevail.
This I know.
Yea! and perchance the time will come
When he shall wish his son were dumb.

*(Enter Strepsiades and Pheidippides.)*

**Strepsiades:** Oh! Oh!
Help! Murder! Help! O neighbours, kinsfolk, townsmen,
Help, one and all, against this base assault,
Ah! Ah! my cheek! my head! O luckless me!
Wretch! do you strike your father?

**Pheidippides:** Yes, Papa.

**Strepsiades:** See! See! he owns he struck me.

**Pheidippides:** To be sure.

**Strepsiades:** Scoundrel! and parricide! and house-breaker!

**Pheidippides:** Thank you: go on, go on: do please go on.
I am quite delighted to be called such names!

**Strepsiades:** O probed Adulterer.

**Pheidippides:** Roses from your lips.

**Strepsiades:** Strike you your father?

**Pheidippides:** O dear yes: what’s more,
I’ll prove I struck you justly.

**Strepsiades:** Struck me justly!
Villain! how can you strike a father justly?

**Pheidippides:** Yes, and I’ll demonstrate it, if you please.

**Strepsiades:** Demonstrate this?

**Pheidippides:** O yes, quite easily.
Come, take your choice, which Logic do you choose?

**Strepsiades:** Which what?

**Pheidippides:** Logic: the Better or the Worse?

**Strepsiades:** Ah, then, in very truth I’ve had you taught
To reason down all Justice, if you think
You can prove this, that it is just and right
That fathers should be beaten by their sons!

**Pheidippides:** Well, well, I think I’ll prove it, if you’ll listen,
So that even you won’t have one word to answer.

**Strepsiades:** Come, I should like to hear what you’ve to say.

**Chorus:** ’Tis yours, old man, some method to contrive
This fight to win:
He would not without arms wherewith to strive
So bold have been.
He knows, be sure, whereon to trust.
His eager bearing proves he must.
So come and tell us from what cause
This sad dispute began;
Come, tell us how it first arose:
Do tell us if you can.

**Strepsiades:** Well from the very first I will
The whole contention show:
’Twas when I went into the house
To feast him, as you know,
I bade him bring his lyre and sing,
The supper to adorn,
Some lay of old *Simonides*,
As, how the Ram was shorn:
But he replied, to sing at meals
Was coarse and obsolete;
Like some old beldame humming airs
The while she grinds her wheat.

**Pheidippides:** And should you not be thrashed who told
Your son, from food abstaining
To sing! as though you were, forsooth
Cicalas entertaining.

**Strepsiades:** You hear him! so he said just now
Or e’er high words began:
And next he called *Simonides*
A very sorry man.
And when I heard him, I could scarce
My rising wrath command;
Yet so I did, and him I bid
Take myrtle in his hand
And chant some lines from *Aeschylus*,
But he replied with ire,
“Believe me, I’m not one of those
Who *Aeschylus* admire,
That rough, unpolished, turgid bard,
That mouther of bombast!”
When he said this, my heart began
To heave extremely fast;
Yet still I kept my passion down,
And said, “Then prithee you,
Sing one of those new-fangled songs
Which modern striplings do.”
And he began the shameful tale
*Euripides* has told
How a brother and a sister lived
Incestuous lives of old.
Then, then I could no more restrain,
But first I must confess
With strong abuse I loaded him,
And so, as you may guess,
We stormed and bandied threat for threat:
Till out at last he flew,
And smashed and thrashed and thumped and bumped
And bruised me black and blue.

**Pheidippides:** And rightly too, who coolly dared
*Euripides* to blame,
Most sapient bard.

**Strepsiades:** Most sapient bard!
You, what’s your fitting name?
Ah! but he’ll pummel me again.

**Pheidippides:** He will: and justly too.

**Strepsiades:** What! justly, heartless villain! when
’Twas I who nurtured you.
I knew your little lisping ways,
How soon, you’d hardly think,
If you cried “bree!” I guessed your wants,
And used to give you drink:
If you said “mamm!” I fetched you bread
With fond discernment true,
And you could hardly say “Caeca!”
When through the door I flew
And held you out a full arm’s length
Your little needs to do:
But now when I was crying
That I with pain was dying,
You brute! you would not tarry
Me out of doors to carry,
But choking with despair
I’ve been and done it there.

**Chorus:** Sure all young hearts are palpitating now
To hear him plead,
Since if those lips with artful words avow
The daring deed,
And once a favouring verdict win,
A fig for every old man’s skin.
O thou! who rakest up new thoughts
With daring hands profane.
Try all you can, ingenious man,
That verdict to obtain.

**Pheidippides:** How sweet it is these novel arts,
These clever words to know,
And have the power established rules
And laws to overthrow.
Why in old times when horses were
My sole delight, ’twas wonder
If I could say a dozen words
Without some awful blunder!
But now that he has made me quit
That reckless mode of living,
And I have been to subtle thoughts
My whole attention giving,
I hope to prove by logic strict
’Tis right to beat my father.

**Strepsiades:** O! buy your horses back, by Zeus,
Since I would ten times rather
Have to support a four-in-hand,
So I be struck no more.

**Pheidippides:** Peace. I will now resume the thread
Where I broke off before.
And first I ask: when I was young,
Did you not strike me then?

**Strepsiades:** Yea: for I loved and cherished you.

**Pheidippides:** Well, solve me this again,
Is it not just that I your son
Should cherish you alike,
And strike you, since, as you observe,
To cherish means to strike?
What! must my body needs be scourged
And pounded black and blue
And yours be scathless? was not I
As much freeborn as you?
“Children are whipped, and shall not sires be whipped?”
Perhaps you’ll urge that children’s minds
Alone are taught by blows:—
Well: Age is Second Childhood then:
That everybody knows.
And as by old experience Age
Should guide its steps more clearly,
So when they err, they surely should
Be punished more severely.

**Strepsiades:** But Law goes everywhere for me:
Deny it, if you can.

**Pheidippides:** Well was not he who made the law,
A man, a mortal man,
As you or I, who in old times
Talked over all the crowd?
And think you that to you or me
The same is not allowed,
To change it, so that sons by blows
Should keep their fathers steady?
Still, we’ll be liberal, and blows
Which we’ve received already
We will forget, we’ll have no *ex post facto* legislation.
—Look at the game-cocks, look at all
The animal creation,
Do not they beat their parents? Aye:
I say then, that in fact
They are as we, except that they
No special laws enact.

**Strepsiades:** Why don’t you then, if always where
The game-cock leads you follow,
Ascend your perch to roost at night,
And dirt and ordure swallow?

**Pheidippides:** The case is different there, old man,
As *Socrates* would see.

**Strepsiades:** Well then you’ll blame yourself at last,
If you keep striking me.

**Pheidippides:** How so?

**Strepsiades:** Why, if it’s right for me to punish you my son,
You can, if you have got one, yours.

**Pheidippides:** Aye, but suppose I’ve none.
Then having gulled me you will die,
While I’ve been flogged in vain.

**Strepsiades:** Good friends! I really think he has
Some reason to complain.
I must concede he has put the case
In quite a novel light:
I really think we should be flogged
Unless we act aright!

**Pheidippides:** Look to a fresh idea then.

**Strepsiades:** He’ll be my death I vow.

**Pheidippides:** Yet then perhaps you will not grudge
Ev’n what you suffer now.

**Strepsiades:** How! will you make me like the blows
Which I’ve received to-day?

**Pheidippides:** Yes, for I’ll beat my mother too.

**Strepsiades:** What! What is that you say!
Why, this is worse than all.

**Pheidippides:** But what, if as I proved the other,
By the same Logic I can prove
’Tis right to beat my mother?

**Strepsiades:** Aye! what indeed! if this you plead,
If this you think to win,
Why then, for all I care, you may

[1] Punishments of those taken in adultery.

**Strepsiades:**
To the Accursed Pit convey
Yourself with all your learning new,
Your master, and your Logic too,
And tumble headlong in.
O Clouds! O Clouds! I owe all this to you!
Why did I let you manage my affairs!

**Chorus:**
Nay, nay, old man, you owe it to yourself.
Why didst thou turn to wicked practices?

**Strepsiades:**
Ah, but ye should have asked me that before,
And not have spurred a poor old fool to evil.

**Chorus:**
Such is our plan. We find a man
On evil thoughts intent,

Guide him along to shame and wrong,
Then leave him to repent.

**Strepsiades:**
Hard words, alas! yet not more hard than just.
It was not right unfairly to keep back
The money that I borrowed. Come, my darling.
Come and destroy that filthy Chaerephon
And Socrates; for they’ve deceived us both!

**Pheidippides:**
No. I will lift no hand against my Tutors.

**Strepsiades:**
Yes do, come, reverence Paternal Zeus.

**Pheidippides:**
Look there! Paternal Zeus! what an old fool.
Is there a Zeus?

**Strepsiades:**
There is.

**Pheidippides:**
There is no Zeus.
Young Vortex reigns, and he has turned out Zeus.

**Strepsiades:**
No Vortex reigns: that was my foolish thought
All through this vortex here. Fool that I was,
To think a piece of earthenware a God.

**Pheidippides:**
Well, rave away, talk nonsense to yourself.
*(Exit.)*

**Strepsiades:**
Oh! fool, fool, fool, how mad I must have been
To cast away the Gods, for Socrates.
Yet Hermes, gracious Hermes, be not angry
Nor crush me utterly, but look with mercy
On faults to which his idle talk hath led me.
And lend thy counsel; tell me, had I better
Plague them with lawsuits, or how else annoy them.
*(Affects to listen.)*
Good: your advice is good: I’ll have no lawsuits,
I’ll go at once and set their house on fire,
The prating rascals. Here, here, Xanthias,
Quick, quick here, bring your ladder and your
pitchfork,
Climb to the roof of their vile thinking-house,
Dig at their tiles, dig stoutly, an’ thou lovest me.
Tumble the very house about their ears.
And someone fetch me here a lighted torch,
And I’ll soon see if, boasters as they are,
They won’t repent of what they’ve done to me.

**1st Student** *(within)*:
O dear! O dear!

**Strepsiades:**
Now, now, my torch, send out a lusty flame.

**1st Student** *(within)*:
Man! what are you at there?

**Strepsiades:**
What am I at? I’ll tell you.
I’m splitting straws with your house-rafters here.

**2nd Student** *(within)*:
Oh me! who’s been and set our
house on fire?

**Strepsiades:**
Who was it, think you, that you stole the
cloak from?

**3rd Student** *(within)*:
O Murder! Murder!

**Strepsiades:**
That’s the very thing,
Unless this pick prove traitor to my hopes,
Or I fall down, and break my blessed neck.

**Socrates** *(at the window)*:
Hallo! what are you at, up on
our roof?

**Strepsiades:**
I walk on air, and contemplate the Sun.

**Socrates:**
O! I shall suffocate. O dear! O dear!

**Chaerephon:**
And I, poor devil, shall be burnt to
death.

**Strepsiades:**
For with what aim did ye insult the Gods,
And pry around the dwellings of the Moon?
Strike, smite them, spare them not, for many reasons,
But most because they have blasphemed the Gods!

**Chorus:**
Lead out of the way: for I think we may say
We have acted our part very fairly to-day.
