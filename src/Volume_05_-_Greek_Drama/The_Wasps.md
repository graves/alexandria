The play opens with a dialogue between two drowsy slaves who have been keeping guard all night before an Athenian house. It is still dark, but the day is at hand.

**Sosias.** You ill-starred Xanthias, what’s the matter now?

**Xanthias.** The nightly watch I’m studying to relieve.

**Sosias.** Why then, your ribs will have a score against you.
Do you forget what sort of beast we’re guarding?

**Xanthias.** No, but I’d fain just drowse dull care away.

**Sosias.** Well, try your luck: for I too feel a sort
Of drowsy sweetness settling o’er my eyes.

**Xanthias.** Sure you’re a maniac or a Corybant.

**Sosias.** (*producing a wine flask*) Nay, ’tis a sleep from great Sabazius holds me.

**Xanthias.** (*producing another*) Aha! and I’m your fellow-votary there.
My lids too felt just now the fierce assault
Of a strong Median nod-compelling sleep.
And then I dreamed a dream; such a strange dream!

**Sosias.** And so did I: the strangest e’er I heard of.
But tell yours first.

**Xanthias.** Methought a monstrous eagle
Came flying towards the market-place, and there
Seized in its claws a wriggling brassy shield,
And bore it up in triumph to the sky,
And then—Cleonymus fled off and dropped it.

**Sosias.** Why then, Cleonymus is quite a riddle.

**Xanthias.** How so?

**Sosias.** A man will ask his boon companions,
“What is that brute which throws away its shield
Alike in air, in ocean, in the field?”

**Xanthias.** O what mishap awaits me, that have seen
So strange a vision?

**Sosias.** Take it not to heart,
’Twill be no harm, I swear it by the Gods.

**Xanthias.** No harm to see a man throw off his shield!
But now tell yours.

**Sosias.** Ah, mine’s a big one, mine is;
About the whole great vessel of the state.

**Xanthias.** Tell us at once the keel of the affair.

**Sosias.** ’Twas in my earliest sleep methought I saw
A flock of sheep assembled in the Pnyx,
Sitting close-packed, with little cloaks and staves;
Then to these sheep I heard, or seemed to hear
An all-receptive grampus holding forth
In tone and accents like a scalded pig.

**Xanthias.** Pheugh!

**Sosias.** Eh?

**Xanthias.** Stop, stop, don’t tell us any more.
Your dream smells horribly of putrid hides.

**Sosias.** Then the vile grampus, scales in hand, weighed out
Bits of fat beef, cut up.

**Xanthias.** Woe worth the day!
He means to cut our city up in bits.

**Sosias.** Methought beside him, on the ground, I saw
Theorus seated, with a raven’s head.
Then Alcibiades lisped out to me,
“Cremark! Theocwus has a cwaven’s head.”

**Xanthias.** Well lisped! and rightly, Alcibiades!

**Sosias.** But is this not ill-omened, that a man
Turn to a crow?

**Xanthias.** Nay, excellent.

**Sosias.** How?

**Xanthias.** How!
Being a man he straight becomes a crow:
Is it not obvious to conjecture that
He’s going to leave us, going to the crows?

**Sosias.** Shall I not pay two obols then, and hire
One who so cleverly interprets dreams?

**Xanthias.** Come, let me tell the story to the audience
With just these few remarks, by way of preface.
Expect not from us something mighty grand,
Nor yet some mirth purloined from Megara.
We have no brace of servants here, to scatter
Nuts from their basket out among the audience,
No Heracles defrauded of his supper.
Nor yet Euripides besmirched again;
No, nor though Cleon shine, by fortune’s favour,
Will we to mincemeat chop the man again.
Ours is a little tale, with meaning in it,
Not too refined and exquisite for you,
Yet wittier far than vulgar comedy.
You see that great big man, the man asleep
Up on the roof, aloft: well, that’s our master.
He keeps his father here, shut up within,
And bids us guard him that he stir not out.
For he, the father, has a strange disease.
Which none of you will know, or yet conjecture,
Unless we tell: else, if you think so, guess.
Amynias there, the son of Pronapes,
Says he’s a dice-lover: but he’s quite out.

**Sosias.** Ah, he conjectures from his own disease.

**Xanthias.** Nay, but the word does really end with -lover.
Then Sosias here observes to Dercylus,
That ’tis a *drink-lover*.

**Sosias.** Confound it, no:
That’s the disease of honest gentlemen.

**Xanthias.** Then next, Nicostratus of Scambon says,
It is a sacrifice- or stranger-lover.

**Sosias.** What, like Philoxenus? No, by the dog,
Not quite so lewd, Nicostratus, as that.

**Xanthias.** Come, you waste words: you’ll never find it out,
So all keep silence if you want to know.
I’ll tell you the disease old master has.
He is a lawcourt-lover, no man like him.
Judging is what he dotes on, and he weeps
Unless he sit on the front bench of all.
At night he gets no sleep, no, not one grain,
Or if he doze the tiniest speck, his soul
Flutters in dreams around the water-clock.
So used he is to holding votes, he wakes
With thumb and first two fingers closed, as one
That offers incense on a new moon’s day.
If on a gate is written “Lovely Demus,”
Meaning the son of Pyrilamp, he goes
And writes beside it “Lovely Verdict-box.”
The cock which crew from eventide, he said,
Was tampered with, he knew, to call him late,
Bribed by officials whose accounts were due.
Supper scarce done, he clamours for his shoes,
Hurries ere daybreak to the Court, and sleeps
Stuck like a limpet to the doorpost there.
So sour he is, the long condemning line
He marks for all, then homeward like a bee
Laden with wax beneath his finger-nails.
Lest he lack votes, he keeps, to judge withal,
A private pebble-beach secure within.
Such is his frenzy, and the more you chide him
The more he judges: so with bolts and bars
We guard him straitly that he stir not out.
For ill the young man brooks his sire’s disease.
And first he tried by soft emollient words
To win him over, not to don the cloak
Or walk abroad: but never a jot he yielded.
He washed and purged him then: but never a jot.
A Corybant next he made him, but old master,
Timbrel and all, into the New Court bursts
And there sits judging. So when these rites failed,
We cross the Strait, and, in Aegina, place him,
To sleep the night inside Asclepius’ temple:
Lo! with the dawn he stands at the Court rails!
Then, after that, we let him out no more.
But he! he dodged along the pipes and gutters,
And so made off: we block up every cranny,
Stopping and stuffing them with clouts of rag:
Quick he drove pegs into the wall, and clambered
Up like an old jackdaw, and so hopped out.
Now then, we compass all the house with nets,
Spreading them round, and mew him safe within.
Well, sirs, Philocleon is the old man’s name;
Ay truly; and the son’s, Bdelycleon;
A wondrous high-and-mighty mannered man.

**Bdelycleon.** (*from the roof*) Xanthias and Sosias! are ye fast asleep?

**Xanthias.** O dear!

**Sosias.** What now?

**Xanthias.** Bdelycleon is up.

**Bdelycleon.** One of you two run hither instantly,
For now my father’s got into the kitchen,
Scurrying, mouselike, somewhere. Mind he don’t
Slip through the hole for turning off the water.
And you, keep pressing at the door.

**Sosias.** Ay, ay, sir.

**Bdelycleon.** O heavens! what’s that? what makes the chimney rumble?
Hallo, sir! who are you?

**Philocleon.** (*in the chimney*) I’m smoke escaping.

**Bdelycleon.** Smoke? of what wood?

**Philocleon.** I’m of the fig-tree panel.

**Bdelycleon.** Ay, and there’s no more stinging smoke than that.
Come, trundle back: what, won’t you? where’s the board?
In with you! nay, I’ll clap this log on too.
There now, invent some other stratagem.
But I’m the wretchedest man that ever was;
They’ll call me now the son of Chimney-smoked.

**Sosias.** He’s at the door now, pushing.

**Bdelycleon.** Press it back then
With all your force: I’m coming there directly.
And O be careful of the bolt and bar,
And mind he does not nibble off the door-pin.

**Philocleon.** (*within*) Let me out, villains! let me out to judge.
What, shall Dracontides escape unpunished!

**Bdelycleon.** What if he should?

**Philocleon.** Why once, when I consulted
The Delphian oracle, the God replied,
That I should wither if a man escaped me.

**Bdelycleon.** Apollo shield us, what a prophecy!

**Philocleon.** O let me out, or I shall burst, I shall.

**Bdelycleon.** No, by Poseidon! no, Philocleon, never!

**Philocleon.** O then by Zeus I’ll nibble through the net.

**Bdelycleon.** You’ve got no teeth, my beauty.

**Philocleon.** Fire and fury!
How shall I slay thee, how? Give me a sword,
Quick, quick, or else a damage-cessing tablet.

**Bdelycleon.** Hang it, he meditates some dreadful deed.

**Philocleon.** O no, I don’t: I only want to take
And sell the donkey and his panniers too.
’Tis the new moon to-day.

**Bdelycleon.** And if it is,
Cannot I sell them?

**Philocleon.** Not so well as I.

**Bdelycleon.** No, but much better: drive the donkey out.

**Xanthias.** How well and craftily he dropped the bait
To make you let him through.

**Bdelycleon.** But he caught nothing
That haul at least, for I perceived the trick.
But I will in, and fetch the donkey out.
No, no; he shan’t come slipping through again.
(*Gets donkey.*)
Donkey, why grieve? at being sold to-day?
Gee up! why grunt and groan, unless you carry
Some new Odysseus there?

**Xanthias.** And, in good truth,
Here is a fellow clinging on beneath.

**Bdelycleon.** Who? where?

**Xanthias.** Why, here.

**Bdelycleon.** Why, what in the world is this?
Who are you, sirrah?

**Philocleon.** Noman I, by Zeus.

**Bdelycleon.** Wherefrom?

**Philocleon.** From Ithaca, son of Runaway.

**Bdelycleon.** Noman I promise to no good you’ll be.
Drag him out there from under. O the villain,
The place he had crept to! Now he seems to me
The very image of a sompnour’s foal.

**Philocleon.** Come now, hands off: or you and I shall fight.

**Bdelycleon.** Fight! what about?

**Philocleon.** About a donkey’s shadow.

**Bdelycleon.** You’re a born bad one, with your tricks and fetches.

**Philocleon.** Bad! O my gracious! then you don’t know yet
How good I am: but wait until you taste
The seasoned paunchlet of a prime old judge.

**Bdelycleon.** Get along in, you and your donkey too.

**Philocleon.** O help me, fellow-dicasts: help me, Cleon!

**Bdelycleon.** Bellow within there when the door is shut.
Now pile a heap of stones against the door,
And shoot the door-pin home into the bar,
And heave the beam athwart it, and roll up,
Quick, the great mortar-block.

**Sosias.** (*starting*) Save us! what’s that?
Whence fell that clod of dirt upon my head?

**Xanthias.** Belike some mouse dislodged it from above.

**Sosias.** A mouse? O, no, a rafter-haunting dicast,
Wriggling about behind the tiling there.

**Bdelycleon.** Good lack! the man is changing to a sparrow
Sure he’ll fly off: where, where’s the casting-net?
Shoo! shoo there! shoo! ’Fore Zeus, ’twere easier work
To guard Scione than a sire like this.

**Sosias.** Well but at last we have fairly scared him in,
He can’t slip out, he can’t elude us now,
So why not slumber just a—just a—drop?

**Bdelycleon.** Slumber, you rogue! when in a little while
His fellow-justices will come this way
Calling him up.

**Sosias.** Why sir, ’tis twilight yet.

**Bdelycleon.** Why then, by Zeus, they are very late to-day.
Soon after midnight is their usual time
To come here, carrying lights, and warbling tunes
Sweet-charming-old-Sidono-Phrynichean
Wherewith they call him out.

**Sosias.** And if they come.
Had we not better pelt them with some stones?

**Bdelycleon.** Pelt them, you rogue! you might as well provoke
A nest of wasps as anger these old men.
Each wears beside his loins a deadly sting,
Wherewith they smite, and on with yells and cries
They leap, and strike at you, like sparks of fire.

**Sosias.** Tut, never trouble, give me but some stones,
I’ll chase the biggest wasps-nest of them all.

*Enter chorus of wasps.*

**Chorus.**
Step out, step out, my comrades stout: no loitering, Comias, pound along,
You’re shirking now, you used, I vow, to pull as tough as leathern thong,
Yet now, with ease, Charinades can walk a brisker pace than you.
Ho! Strymodore of Conthyte, the best of all our dicast crew,
Has old Euergides appeared, and Chabes too from Phlya, pray?
Ah! here it strains, the poor remains, alas! alas! alack the day,
Of that mad set, I mind it yet, when once we paced our nightly round,
In years gone by, both you and I, along Byzantium’s wall, and found
And stole away the baker’s tray, and sliced it up, and chopped it well,
A merry blaze therewith to raise, and so we cooked our pimpernel.
On, on again, with might and main: for Laches’ turn is come to-day:
Quick, look alive, a splendid hive of wealth the fellow’s got, they say.
And Cleon too, our patron true, enjoined us each betimes to bring
Of anger sore an ample store, a good three days’ provisioning:
On all the man’s unrighteous plans a vengeance well-deserved to take.
Come, every dear and tried compeer, come, quickly come, ere morning break,
And as you go, be sure you throw the light around on every side;
Lest somewhere nigh a stone may lie, and we therefrom be damnified.

**Boy.** O father, father, here’s some mud! look sharp or in you’ll go.

**Chorus.** Pick up a stick, and trim the wick, a better light to show.

**Boy.** Nay, father, with my finger, thus, I choose to trim the lamp.

**Chorus.** How dare you rout the wick about, you little wasteful scamp,
And that with oil so scarce? but no, it don’t disturb your quiet.
However dear the oil may be, when I have got to buy it.

**Boy.** If with your knuckles once again you ’monish us, I swear
We’ll douse the light, and take to flight, and leave you floundering there.
Then wading on without the lamp in darkness, I’ll be bound
You’ll stir and splash the mud about, like snipes in marshy ground.

**Chorus.**
Ah, greater men than you, my boy, ’tis often mine to beat.
But, bless me, this is filth indeed I feel beneath my feet:
Ay, and within four days from this, or sooner, it is plain,
God will send down upon our town a fresh supply of rain:
So dense and thick around the wick these thieves collect and gather,
And that’s, as everybody knows, a sign of heavy weather.
Well, well, ’tis useful for the fruits, and all the backward trees,
To have a timely fall of rain, and eke a good North breeze.
But how is this? Our friend not here! how comes it he’s so slack?
By Zeus, he never used to be at all a hanger-back.
He always marched before us all, on legal cares intent,
And some old tune of Phrynichus he warbled as he went.
O he’s a wonder for the songs! Come, comrades, one and all,
Come stand around the house, and sing, its master forth to call.
If once he hears me tuning up, I know it won’t be long
Before he comes creep, creeping out, from pleasure at the song.

How is it our friend is not here to receive us?
Why comes he not forth from his dwelling?
Can it be that he’s had the misfortune to lose
His one pair of shoes;
Or striking his toe in the dark, by the grievous
Contusion is lamed, and his ankle inflamed?
Or his groin has, it may be, a swelling.
He of us all, I ween,
Was evermore the austerest, and most keen.
Alone no prayers he heeded:
Whene’er for grace they pleaded,
He bent (like this) his head,
“You cook a stone,” he said.
Is it all of that yesterday’s man who cajoled us,
And slipped through our hands, the deceiver
Pretending a lover of Athens to be,
Pretending that he
Was the first, of the Samian rebellion that told us?
Our friend may be sick with disgust at the trick,
And be now lying ill of a fever.
That would be like him quite.
But now up, up, nor gnaw your soul with spite
There comes a traitor base,
A wealthy rogue from Thrace.
Safe in our toils we’ve got him,
Up, up, old friend, and pot him!
On with you, boy, on with you.

**Boy.** Father, if a boon I pray,
Will you grant it, father, eh?

**Chorus.** Certainly I will, my son.
Tell me what you’d have me buy
Dibs, my son? Hey, my son?
Dibs it is, undoubtedly.

**Boy.** Dibs, my father! No, my father!
Figs! for they are sweeter far.

**Chorus.** You be hanged first: yet you shall not
Have them, monkey, when you are.

**Boy.** Then, my father, woe betide you!
Not another step I’ll guide you.

**Chorus.** Is it not enough that I
With this paltry pay must buy
Fuel, bread, and sauce for three?
Must I needs buy figs for thee!

**Boy.** Father, if the Archon say
That the Court won’t sit to-day.
Tell me truly, father mine,
Have we wherewithal to dine?
O my father, should not we
Then in “Straits of Helle” be?

**Chorus.** Out upon it! out upon it!
Then, indeed, I should not know
For a little bit of supper
Whither in this world to go.

**Boy.** Why, my mother, didst thou breed me,
giving nothing else to feed me,
But a store of legal woe?

**Chorus.** Empty scrip! O empty show,
Bootless, fruitless ornament!

**Boy.** O! O! woe! woe!
Ours to sorrow and lament.

**Philocleon.** (*appearing above*) Long my reins have been stirred,
Long through chinks have I heard,
Heard your voices below.
Vain my efforts to sing,
These forbid me to go.
Vainly my sad heart yearns,
Yearns to be marching with you,
On to the judgement urns,
There some mischief to do.
O change to smoke by a lightning stroke,
Dread-thundering Zeus! this body of mine,
Till I’m like Proxenides, like the son
Of Sellus, that false tree-vine.
O Sovereign, pity my woeful lot,
Vouchsafe to grant me my heart’s desire,
Fry me in dust with a glittering, hot,
Red bolt of celestial fire,
Then take me up with thy hand divine,
And puff me, and plunge me in scalding brine.
Or turn me into the stone, whereon
They count the votes when the trial is done.

**Chorus.** Who is he that thus detains you?
Who with bolted door restrains you?
Tell us, you will speak to friends.

**Philocleon.** ’Tis my son, but don’t be bawling: for he’s slumbering now at ease
There, upon the roof before you: drop your tone a little, please.

**Chorus.** What’s his object, idle trifler, that he does such things as these?
What’s the motive he pretends?

**Philocleon.** He will let me do no mischief, and no more a lawsuit try.
True it is he’ll feast and pet me, but with that I won’t comply.

**Chorus.** This the Demagogcleon blared
Out against you, since you dared
Truth about the fleet to show.
He must be involved, I see,
In some dark conspiracy,
Else he durst not use you so.
It is time some means of escape to find, some novel, ingenious plan, that so,
Unseen of your son, you may get you down, alighting in safety here below.

**Philocleon.** O what shall it be? consider it ye! I’m ready to do whatever is planned:
So sorely I’m longing a circuit to go, through the lists of the Court, with a vote in my hand.

**Chorus.** Can you find no cranny or secret run, through which, from within, your path to urge,
And then like wily Odysseus, here, disguised in tatters and rags, emerge?

**Philocleon.** Each cranny is barred: there’s never a run, thro’ which though it were but a midge could squeeze.
You must think, if you can, of a likelier plan: I can’t run out like a runnet cheese.

**Chorus.** O don’t you remember the old campaign, when you stole the spit, and let yourself down,
And away by the side of the wall you hied? ’Twas when we had captured Naxos town.

**Philocleon.** Ah, well I remember! but what of that? it is quite another affair to-day.
For then I was young, and then I could steal, and over myself I possessed full sway.
And then none guarded my steps, but I
Was free, wherever I chose, to fly;
Whilst now, in every alley and street,
Armed men with arms are stationed about,
Watching with care that I steal not out.
And there at the gate you may see those two
Waiting with spits to spit me through,
Like a cat that is running away with the meat.

**Chorus.** Well but now be quickly shaping
Some contrivance for escaping;
Morning breaks, my honey-bee.

**Philocleon.** Then the best that I can think of, is to gnaw these meshes through.
May Dictynna, queen of hunters, pardon me the deed I do.

**Chorus.** Spoken like a man whose efforts will salvation’s goal ensue.
Ply your jaw then lustily.

**Philocleon.** There, I’ve gnawn them through completely—Ah! but do not raise a shout,
We must use the greatest caution, lest Bdelycleon find us out.

**Chorus.** Fear not: fear not: if he speak,
He shall gnaw his heart, and seek
For his life to run amain.
We will quickly make him learn
Nevermore again to spurn
Th’ holy statutes of the Twain.
So now to the window lash the cord, and twine it securely your limbs around.
With all Diopeithes fill your soul, then let yourself cleverly down to the ground.

**Philocleon.** But suppose they catch me suspended here, and hoist me up by the line again,
And angle me into the house once more, say what ye will do to deliver me then.

**Chorus.** Our hearts of oak we’ll summon to aid, and all give battle at once for you.
’Twere vain to attempt to detain you more: such wonderful feats we are going to do.

**Philocleon.** This then will I do, confiding in you: and if anything happens to me, I implore
That you take me up and bewail my fate, and bury me under the court-house floor.

**Chorus.** O nothing, nothing will happen to you: keep up, old comrade, your heart and hope;
First breathe a prayer to your father’s gods: then let yourself down by the trusty rope.

**Philocleon.** O Lycus, neighbour and hero and lord! thou lovest the selfsame pleasures as I;
Day after day we both enjoy the suppliant’s tears and his wailing cry.
Thou camest here thine abode to fix, on purpose to listen to sounds so sweet,
The only hero of all that deigns by the mourner’s side to assume his seat:
O pity thine old familiar friend: O save me and succour me, Power Divine!
And never again will I do my needs by the osier matting that guards thy shrine.

**Bdelycleon.** Get up, get up.

*Bdelycleon suddenly reappears and wakes up the slumbering slaves.*

**Sosias.** Why, what’s in the wind?

**Bdelycleon.** Some voice seems circling me round and round.

**Sosias.** Is the old man slipping away thro’ a hole?

**Bdelycleon.** No, by Zeus, but he lets himself down to the ground
Tied on to the rope.

**Sosias.** You infamous wretch!
what, won’t you be quiet and not come down?

**Bdelycleon.** Climb up by the other window-sill,
and wallop him well with the harvest crown.
I warrant he’ll speedily back stern first,
when he’s thrashed with the branch of autumnal fruits.

**Philocleon.** Help! help! all those whoever propose
this year to busy themselves with suits.
Smicythion, help! Tisiades, help!
Pheredeipnus, Chremon, the fray begin:
O now or never assist your friend,
before I’m carried away within.

**Chorus.** Wherefore slumbers, wherefore slumbers,
that resentment in our breast,
Such as when a rash assailant
dares provoke our hornets-nest?
Now protruding, now protruding,
Comes the fierce and dreadful sting,
Which we wield for punishing.
Children, hold these garments for us:
then away with all your speed,
Shout and run and bawl to Cleon,
tell him of this direful deed;
Bid him quickly hither fly
As against a city-hater,
And a traitor doomed to die,
One who actually proposes
That we should no lawsuits try. *Exit boys.*

**Bdelycleon.** (*entering*) Listen, worthy sirs, to reason: goodness! don’t keep screaming so.

**Chorus.** Scream! we’ll scream as high as heaven.

**Bdelycleon.** I don’t intend to let him go.

**Chorus.** These be frightful things to see!
This is open tyranny!
Rouse the State! Rouse the great
God-abhorred Sneak Theorus!
And whoe’er Else is there,
Fawning lord Ruling o’er us.

**Xanthias.** Heracles! they’ve stings beside them! Master, master, don’t you see?

**Bdelycleon.** Ay, which slew the son of Gorgias,
Philip, with their sharp decree.

**Chorus.** You we’ll also slay directly!
Wheel about him, everyone,
Draw your stings, and, all together,
in upon the fellow run.
Close your ranks, collect your forces,
brimming full of rage and hate,
He shall know the sort of wasps-nest
he has dared to irritate.

**Xanthias.** Now with such as these to combat
is, by Zeus, a serious thing:
Verily I quake and tremble,
but to look upon their sting.

**Chorus.** Let him go! Loose your hold!
If you don’t I declare
You shall bless Tortoise-backs
For the shells Which they wear.

**Philocleon.** On then, on, my fellow-dicasts,
brother wasps of heart severe,
Some fly in with angry buzzings,
and attack them in the rear,
Some surround them in a ring, and
both their eyes and fingers sting.

**Bdelycleon.** Ho there! Midas! Phryx! Masynias!
hither! hither! haste to me!
Take my father, guard him safely:
suffer none to set him free;
Else you both shall lunch off nothing,
clapped in fetters strong and stout.
There’s a sound of many fig-leaves
(well I know it) buzzed about.

**Chorus.** This shall stand infixed within you
if you will not let him go.

**Philocleon.** Mighty Cecrops! King and hero!
Dragon-born and -shaped below,
Wilt thou let these rude barbarians
vex and maul me at their pleasure,
Me who heretofore have made them
weep in full imperial measure?

**Chorus.** Truly, of abundant evils,
age is evermore the source:
Only see how these two scoundrels
hold their ancient lord perforce,
Clean forgetting how, aforetime,
he their daily wants supplied,
Bought them little sleeveless jackets,
bought them caps and coats of hide,
Clean forgetting all the kindness
shown their feet in wintry weather,
How from chill and cold he kept them:
ah! but these have altogether
Banished from their eyes the reverence
owing to those dear old brogues.

**Philocleon.** Won’t you even now unhand me,
shameless villain, worst of rogues?
When the grapes I caught you stealing,
O remember, if you can,
How I tied you to the olive,
and I flogged you like a man,
So that all beheld with envy:
but a grateful soul you lack!
Oh, unhand me, you, and you,
at once, before my son come back.

**Chorus.** But a famous retribution
ye for this shall undergo,
One that will not lag nor linger;
so that ye betimes shall know,
Know the mood of angry-tempered,
righteous, mustard-glancing men.

*Here Bdelycleon suddenly issues from the house, followed by Xanthias and Sosias, the former armed with a stick, the latter carrying an apparatus for smoking-out wasps.*

**Bdelycleon.** Beat them, Xanthias, from the door-way;
beat the wasps away again.

**Xanthias.** That I will, sir.

**Bdelycleon.** Fume them, Sosias,
drive the smoke in dense and thick.
Shoo there, shoo! be off, confound you.
At them, Xanthias, with the stick!
Smoke them, Sosias, smoke, infusing
Aeschines, Selartius’ son.

**Sosias.** So then we at last were going,
as it seems, to make you run.

**Bdelycleon.** But you never would have managed
thus to beat them off with ease,
Had it chanced that they had eaten
of the songs of Philocles.

**Chorus.** Creeping o’er us, creeping o’er us,
Here at least the poor can see,
Stealthy-creeping tyranny!
If you from the laws debar us,
which the city has ordained,
You, a curly-haired Amynias,
you, a rascal double-grained,
Not by words of wit persuading,
Not for weighty reasons shown,
But because, forsooth, you will,
Like an autocrat, alone.

**Bdelycleon.** Can’t we now, without this outcry,
and this fierce denunciation,
Come to peaceful terms together,
terms of reconciliation?

**Chorus.** Terms with thee, thou people-hater,
and with Brasidas, thou traitor,
Hand and glove! You who dare
Woolly-fringed Clothes to wear,
Yes, and show Beard and hair
Left to grow Everywhere.

# The Wasps

drop my father altogether
Than endure these daily conflicts,
buffeting with waves and weather.
Ch. Why, as yet you've hardly entered
on the parsley and the rue:
(That we'll just throw in, a sample
of our three-quart words for you.)
Now you care not, wait a little,
till the prosecutor trounce you,
Sluicing out these selfsame charges,
and conspirator denounce you.
Bd. O by all the gods I ask you,
will ye never go away?
Are ye quite resolved to linger,
thwacked and thwacking all the day?
Ch. Never more
Will I, while
There's a grain
Left of me,
Leave your door,
Traitor vile,
Bent to gain
Tyranny.
Bd. Ay, "Conspiracy" and "Tyrant,"
These with you are all in all,
Whatsoe'er is brought before you,
be the matter great or small.
Everywhere the name of Tyrant,
now for fifty years unknown,
Is than cheap salt-fish at Athens
commoner and cheaper grown.
Everywhere about the market
it is bandied to and fro:
If you wish a basse to purchase,
and without a pilchard go,
Straight the man who sells the pilchards
grumbles from his stall hard by,
"Here is plainly one that caters
with a view to Tyranny."
If a leek, besides, you order,
relish for your sprats perchance,
Says the potherb-girl directly,
eyeing you with looks askance,
"Leeks indeed! and leeks I prithee!
what, with Tyranny in view?
Athens must be taxed, you fancy,
relish to supply for you!"
Xa. Even so a naughty damsel
yesternoon observed to me,
Just because I said her manners
were a little bit too free,
She supposed that I was wishing
*Hippias*'s Tyranny.
Bd. Ay, by charges such as these
our litigious friends they please.

504–540

Bd. Now because I'd have my father
(quitting all this toil and strife,
This up-early-false-informing-
troublesome-litigious life)
Live a life of ease and splendour,
live like *Morychus*, you see—
Straight I'm charged with Tyrant leanings,
charged with foul conspiracy.
Ph. Yes, by Zeus, and very justly.
Not for pigeon's milk in store
I the pleasant life would barter
which you let me lead no more.
Nought I care for eels and ray-fish:
daintier food to me would seem
Just a little, tiny lawsuit,
dished and steeped in its steam.
Bd. Yes, for that's the sort of dainty
you, by Zeus, have loved so long.
Yet I think I'll soon convince you
that your mode of life is wrong,
If you can but once be silent,
and to what I say give heed.
Ph. I am wrong to be a dicast!
Bd. Laughed to utter scorn indeed,
Mocked by men you all but worship,
for you can't their treachery see,
You're a slave, and yet don't know it.
Ph. Name not slavery to me:
I am lord of all, I tell you.
Bd. You're the veriest drudge, I vow,
Thinking that you're lord of all. For
come, my father, teach us now,
If you reap the fruits of *Hellas*,
what's the benefit to you?
Ph. Willingly. Let these be umpires.
Bd. I'll accept their judgment too.
Now then all at once release him.
Ph. And besides a sword supply,
If in this dispute I'm worsted,
here upon this sword I'll die.
Bd. But suppose you won't their final
(what's the phrase) award obey?
Ph. May I never drink thereafter,
pure and neat, good fortune's—pay.
Ch. Now must the champion, going
Out of our school, be showing
Keen wit and genius new,
Bd. Bring forth my memorandum-book:
bring forth my desk to write in.
I'll quickly show you what you're like,
if that's your style of fighting.
Ch. In quite another fashion
To aught this youth can do.
Stern is the strife and anxious
For all our earthly good,
If he intends to conquer,
Which Heaven forfend he should.
Bd. Now I'll observe his arguments,
and take a note of each.
Ph. What would you say, if he today
should make the conquering speech?
Ch. Ah! should that mischance befall us,

## THE WASPS

541–573 ARISTOPHANES 574-604

Ch. Our old troop were nothing worth:
In the streets with ribald mirth
Idle boys would dotards call us,
Fit for nought but olive-bearing,
Shriveled husks of counter swearing.
O friend upon whom it devolves to plead
the cause of our Sovereign Power today,
Now show us your best; now bring to the test
each trick that an eloquent tongue can play.
Ph. Away, away, like a racer gay,
I start at once from the head of the lists,
To prove that no kinglier power than ours
in any part of the world exists.
Is there any creature on earth more blest,
more feared and petted from day to day,
Or that leads a happier, pleasanter life,
than a Justice of Athens, though old and grey?
For first when rising from bed in the morn,
to the criminal Court betimes I trudge,
Great six-foot fellows are there at the rails,
in an anxious haste to salute their Judge.
And the delicate hand, which has dipped so deep
in the public purse, he claps into mine,
And he bows before me, and makes his prayer,
and softens his voice to a pitiful whine:
"O pity me, pity me, Sire," he cries,
"if you ever indulged your longing for pelf,
When you managed the mess on a far campaign,
or served some office of state yourself."
The man would never have heard my name,
if he had not been tried and acquitted before.
Bd. (writing) I'll take a note of the point you make,
that 'suppliant fellows your grace implore.'
Ph. So when they have begged and implored me
enough,
and my angry temper is wiped away,
I enter in and I take my seat,
and then I do none of the things I say.
I hear them utter all sorts of cries
designed expressly to win my grace,
What won't they utter, what don't they urge,
to coax a Justice who tries their case?
Some vow they are needy and friendless men,
and over their poverty wail and whine,
And reckon up hardships, false and true,
till he makes them out to be equal to mine.
Some tell us a legend of days gone by,
or a joke from *Aesop* witty and sage,
Or jest and banter, to make me laugh,
that so I may doff my terrible rage.
And if all this fails, and I stand unmoved,
he leads by the hand his little ones near,
He brings his girls and he brings his boys;
and I, the Judge, am composed to hear.
They huddle together with piteous bleats:
while trembling above them he prays to me,
Prays as to a God his accounts to pass,
to give him a quittance, and leave him free.
"If thou lovest a bleating male of the flock,
O lend thine ear to this boy of mine;
Or pity this sweet little delicate girl,
if thy soul delights in the squeaking of swine."

604-643

Ph. So then we relax the pitch of our wrath,
and screw it down to a peg more low.
Is this not a fine dominion of mine,
a derision of wealth with its pride and show?
Bd. (Writing) A second point for my note-book that,
"A derision of wealth with its show and its pride."
Go on to mention the good you get
by your empire of *Hellas* so vast and wide.
Ph. 'Tis ours to inspect the Athenian youths,
when we enter their names on the rolls of men.
And if ever *Oeagrus* gets into a suit,
be sure that he'll never get out again
Till he give us a speech from his *Niobe* part,
selecting the best and the liveliest one.
And then if a piper gain his cause,
he pays us our price for the kindness done,
By piping a tune with his mouth-band on,
quick march as out of the Court we go.
And what if a father by will to a friend
his daughter and heiress bequeath and bestow,
We care not a rap for the Will, or the cap
which is there on the seal so grand and sedate,
We bid them begone, and be hanged, and ourselves
take charge of the girl and her worthy estate;
And we give her away to whoever we choose,
to whoever may chance to persuade us: yet we,
Whilst other officials must pass an account,
alone from control and accounting are free.
Bd. Ay that, and that only, of all you have said,
I own is a privilege lucky and rare,
But uncapping the seal of the heiress's will
seems rather a shabby and doubtful affair.
Ph. And if ever the Council or People have got
a knotty and difficult case to decide,
They pass a decree for the culprits to go
to the able and popular Courts to be tried:
*Evathlus*, and He! the loser of shields,
the fawning, the great *Cowardonymus* say
"They'll always be fighting away for the mob,"
"the people of Athens they'll never betray."
And none in the People a measure can pass,
unless he propose that the Courts shall be free,
Dismissed and discharged for the rest of the day
when once we have settled a single decree.
Yea, *Cleon* the Bawler and Brawler himself,
at us, and us only, to nibble forbears,
And sweeps off the flies that annoy us, and still
with a vigilant hand for our dignity cares.
You never have shown such attention as this,
or displayed such a zeal in your father's affairs.
Yet *Theorus*, a statesman as noble and grand
as lordly *Euphemius*, runs at our call
And whips out a sponge from his bottle, and stoops,
to black and to polish the shoes of us all.
Such, such is the glory, the joy, the renown,
from which you desire to retain and withhold me,
And this you will show, this Empire of mine,
to be bondage and slavery merely, you told me.
Bd. Ay, chatter your fill, you will cease before
long:
and then I will show that your boasted success
Is just the success of a tail that is washed,
going back to its filth and its slovenliness.
Ph. But the nicest and pleasantest part of it all
is this, which I'd wholly forgotten to say,
'Tis when with my fee in my wallet I come,
returning home at the close of the day,
O then what a welcome I get for its sake;
my daughter, the darling, is foremost of all,
And she washes my feet and anoints them with care,
and above them she stoops, and a kiss lets fall,
Till at last by the pretty *Papas* of her tongue
she angles withal my three-obol away.
Then my dear little wife, she sets on the board
nice manchets of bread in a tempting array,
And cosily taking a seat by my side,
with loving entreaty constrains me to feed:
"I beseech you taste this, I implore you try that."
This, this I delight in, and ne'er may I need
To look to yourself and your pantler, a scrub
who, whenever I ask him my breakfast to set,
Keeps grumbling and murmuring under his breath.
No! no! if he haste not a manchet to get,
Lo here my defence from the evils of life,
my armour of proof, my impregnable shield.
And what if you pour me no liquor to drink,
yet here's an old Ass, full of wine, that I wield,
And I tilt him, and pour for myself, and imbibe;
whilst sturdy old Jack, as a bumper I drain,
Lets fly at your goblet a bray of contempt,
a mighty and masterful snort of disdain.
Is this not a fine dominion of mine?
Is it less than the empire of Zeus?
Why the very same phrases, so grand and
divine,
For me, as for Him, are in use.
For when we are raging loud and high
In stormy, tumultuous din,
"O Lord! O Zeus!" say the passers-by,
"How thunders the Court within!"
The wealthy and great, when my lightnings glare,
Turn pale and sick, and mutter a prayer.
You fear me too: I protest you do:
Yes, yes, by *Demeter* I vow 'tis true.
But hang me if I am afraid of you.
Ch. I never, no, I never
Have heard so clear and clever
And eloquent a speech—
Ph. Ay, ay, he thought he'd steal my grapes,
and pluck them undefended,
For well he knew that I'm in this
particularly splendid.
Ch. No topic he omitted,
But he duly went through each.
I waxed in size to hear him
Till with ecstasy possessed
Methought I sat a-judging
In the Islands of the Blest.
Ph. See how uneasily he stands,
and gapes, and shifts his ground.
I warrant, sir, before I've done,
you'll look like a beaten hound.

515

644-674

Ph. You must now, young man, be
seeking
Every turn and every twist
Which can your defence assist.
To a youth against me speaking
Mine's a heart 'tis hard to render
(So you'll find it) soft and tender.
And therefore unless you can speak to the point,
you must look for a millstone handy and good,
Fresh hewn from the rock, to shiver and shock
the unyielding grit of my resolute mood.
Bd. Hard were the task, and shrewd the intent,
for a Comedy-poet all too great
To attempt to heal an inveterate, old
disease engrained in the heart of the state.
Yet, O dread *Cronides*, Father and Lord,
Ph. Stop, stop, don't talk in that father-me way,
Convince me at once that I'm only a slave,
or else I protest you shall die this day
Albeit I then must ever abstain
from the holy flesh of the victims slain.
Bd. Then listen my own little pet Papa,
and smooth your brow from its frowns again.
And not with pebbles precisely ranged,
but roughly thus on your fingers count
The tribute paid by the subject States,
and just consider its whole amount;
And then, in addition to this, compute
the many taxes and one-per-cents,
The fees and the fines, and the silver mines,
the markets and harbours and sales and rents.
If you take the total result of the lot,
'twill reach two thousand talents or near.
And next put down the Justices' pay,
and reckon the sums they receive a year:
Six thousand Justices, count them through,
there dwell no more in the land as yet.
One hundred and fifty talents a year
I think you will find is all they get.
Ph. Then not one tithe of our income goes
to furnish forth the Justices' pay.
Bd. No, certainly not.
Ph. And what becomes
of all the rest of the revenue, pray?
Bd. Why, bless you, it goes to the pockets of those,
"To the rabble of Athens I'll ever be true.
I'll always battle away for the mob."
O father, my father, 'tis owing to you:
By such small phrases as these cajoled,
you lift them over yourselves to reign.
And then, believe me, they soon contrive
some fifty talents in bribes to gain.
Extorting them out of the subject states,
by hostile menace and angry frown:
"Hand over," they say, "the tribute-pay,
or else my thunders shall crush your town."
You joy the while at the remnants vile,
the trotters and tips of your power to gnaw.
So when our knowing, acute allies
the rest, the scum of the Populace, saw
On a vote-box pine, and on nothingness dine,
and marked how lanky and lean ye grow.

## THE WASPS

675-705

Ch. They count you all as a *Connas*'s vote,
and ever and ever on these bestow
Wines, cheeses, necklaces, sesame fruit,
and jars of pickle and pots of honey,
Rugs, cushions, and mantles, and cups, and crowns,
and health, and vigour, and lots of money.
Whilst you! from out of the broad domain
for which on the land and the wave you toiled,
None gives you so much as a garlic head,
to flavour the dish when your sprats are boiled.
Ph. That's true no doubt, for I just sent out,
and bought, myself, from *Eucharides* three:
But you wear me away by your long delay
in proving my bondage and slavery.
Bd. Why is it not slavery pure and neat,
when these (themselves and their parasites too)
Are all in receipt of their pay, God wot,
as high officials of state: whilst you
Must thankful be for your obols three,
those obols which ye yourselves have won
In the battle's roar, by sea and by shore,
'mid sieges and miseries many a one.
But O what throttles me most of all,
is this, that under constraint you go,
When some young dissolute spark comes in,
some son of a *Chaereas*, straddling—so,
With his legs apart, and his body poised,
and a mincing, soft, effeminate air,
And bids you Justices, one and all,
betimes in the morn to the Court repair,
For that any who after the signal come
shall lose and forfeit their obols three.
Yet come as late as he choose himself,
he pockets his drachma, 'Counsel's fee.'
And then if a culprit give him a bribe,
he gets his fellow the job to share,
And into each other's hands they play,
and manage together the suit to square.
Just like two men at a saw they work,
and one keeps pulling, and one gives way.
While you at the Treasurer stare and gape,
and never observe the tricks they play.
Ph. Is that what they do! O can it be true!
Ah me, the depths of my being are stirred,
Your statements shake my soul, and I feel
I know not how, at the things I've heard.
Bd. And just consider when you and all
might revel in affluence, free as air,
How these same demagogues wheel you round,
and cabin and coop you I know not where.
And you, the lord of such countless towns,
from *Pontus* to *Sardo*, nought obtain
Save this poor pittance you earn, and this
they dole you in driblets, grain by grain,
As though they were dropping oil from wool,
as much forsooth as will life sustain.
They mean you all to be poor and gaunt,
and I'll tell you, father, the reason why.
They want you to know your keeper's hand;
and then if he hiss you on to fly
At some helpless foe, away you go,
with eager vehemence ready and rough.

516

706-747

Bd. Since if they wished to maintain you well,
the way to do it were plain enough.
A thousand cities our rule obey,
a thousand cities their tribute pay,
Allot them twenty Athenians each,
to feed and nourish from day to day,
And twice ten thousand citizens there,
are living immersed in dishes of hare,
With creams and beestings and sumptuous fare,
and garlands and coronals everywhere,
Enjoying a fate that is worthy the state,
and worthy the trophy on *Marathon* plain.
Whilst now like gleaners ye all are fain
to follow along in the paymaster's train.
Ph. O what can this strange sensation mean,
this numbness that over my hand is stealing?
My arm no longer can hold the sword:
I yield, unmanned, to a womanish feeling.
Bd. Let a panic possess them, they're ready to give
*Euboea* at once for the State to divide,
And engage to supply for every man
full fifty bushels of wheat beside.
But five poor bushels of barley each
is all that you ever obtained in fact,
And that doled out by the quart, while first
they worry you under the Alien Act.
And therefore it was that I locked you away
To keep you in ease; unwilling that these
With empty mouthings your age should bilk.
And now I offer you here today
Without any reserve whatever you please,
Save only a draught of—Treasurer's milk.
Ch. 'Twas a very acute and intelligent man,
whoever it was, that happened to say,
"Don't make up your mind till you've heard both
sides,"
for now I protest you have gained the fray.
Our staves of justice, our angry mood,
for ever and ever aside we lay,
And we turn to talk to our old compeer,
our choir-companion of many a day.
Don't be a fool: give in, give in,
Nor too perverse and stubborn be;
I would to Heaven my kith and kin
Would show the like regard for me.
Some deity, 'tis plain, befriends
Your happy lot, believe, believe it;
With open arms his aid he sends,
Do you with open arms receive it.
Bd. I'll give him whatever his years require,
A basin of gruel, and soft attire,
And a good warm rug, and a handmaid fair,
To chafe and cherish his limbs with care.
—But I can't like this, that he stands so
mute,
And speaks not a word nor regards my suit.
Ch. 'Tis that his soberer thoughts review
The frenzy he indulged so long,
And (what he would not yield to you)
He feels his former life was wrong.
Perchance he'll now amend his plan,
Unbend his age to mirth and laughter,

## ARISTOPHANES

748-796

Ch. A better and a wiser man
By your advice he'll live hereafter.
Ph. O misery! O misery!
Bd. O father, why that dolorous cry?
Ph. Talk not of things like these to me!
Those are my pleasures, there would I be
Where the Usher cries
"Who has not voted? Let him arise."
And O that the last of the voting band
By the verdict-box I could take my stand.
On, on, my soul! why, where is she gone?
Hah! by your leave, my shadowy one!
Zounds, if I catch when in Court I'm sitting
*Cleon* again a theft committing!
Bd. O father, father, by the gods comply.
Ph. Comply with what? Name any wish, save one.
Bd. Save what, I prithee?
Ph. Not to judge; but that
Hades shall settle ere my soul comply.
Bd. Well but if these are really your delights,
Yet why go there? why not remain at home
And sit and judge among your household here?
Ph. Folly! judge what?
Bd. The same as there you do.
Suppose you catch your housemaid on the sly
Opening the door: fine her for that, one drachma.
That's what you did at every sitting there.
And very aptly, if the morning's fine,
You'll fine your culprits, sitting in the sun.
In snow, enter your judgments by the fire
While it rains on; and—though you sleep till midday,
No archon here will close the door against you.
Ph. Hah! I like that.
Bd. And then, however long
An orator proses on, no need to fast,
Worrying yourself (ay, and the prisoner too).
Ph. But do you really think that I can judge
As well as now, whilst eating and digesting?
Bd. As well? Much better. When there's reckless swearing,
Don't people say, what time and thought and trouble
It took the judges to digest the case?
Ph. I'm giving in. But you've not told me yet
How I'm to get my pay.
Bd. I'll pay you.
Ph. Good,
Then I shall have mine to myself, alone;
For once *Lysistratus*, the funny fool,
Played me the scurviest trick. We'd got one
drachma
Betwixt us two: he changed it at the fish-stall;
Then laid me down three mullet scales: and I,
I thought them obols, popped them in my mouth;
O the vile smell! Ola! I spat them out
And collared him.
Bd. And what said he?
Ph. The rascal!
He said I'd got the stomach of a cock.
"You'll soon digest hard coin," he says, says he.
Bd. Then there again you'll get a great advantage.

517

888-933

Ph. Ay, ay, that's something: let's begin at once.
Bd. Then stop a moment whilst I fetch the traps.
Exit.
Ph. See here now, how the oracles come true.
Oft have I heard it said that the Athenians
One day would try their lawsuits in their homes,
That each would have a little courtlet built
For his own use, in his own porch, before
His entrance, like a shrine of *Hecate*.
Bd. (bustling in with a quantity of judicial properties)
Now then I hope you're satisfied: I've brought
All that I promised, and a lot besides.
See here I'll hang this vessel on a peg,
In case you want it as the suit proceeds.
Ph. Now that I call extremely kind and thoughtful,
And wondrous handy for an old man's needs.
Bd. And here's a fire, and gruel set beside it,
All ready when you want it.
Ph. Good again.
Now if I'm feverish I shan't lose my pay,
For here I'll sit, and sip my gruel too.
But why in the world have you brought me out the
cock?
Bd. To wake you, father, crowing over head
In case you're dozing whilst a prisoner pleads.
Ph. One thing I miss, and only one.
Bd. What's that?
Ph. If you could somehow fetch the shrine of *Lycus*!
Bd. Here then it is, and here's the king in person.
Ph. O hero lord, how stern you are to see!
Bd. Almost, methinks, like our—*Cleonymus*.
Xa. Ay, and 'tis true the hero has no shield!
Bd. If you got seated sooner, I should sooner
Call a suit on.
Ph. Call on, I've sat for ages.
Bd. Let's see: what matter shall I bring on first?
Who's been at mischief of the household here?
That careless *Thratta* now, she charred the pitcher.
Ph. O stop, for goodness' sake! you've all but killed me.
What! call a suit on with no railing here,
Always the first of all our sacred things?
Bd. No more there is, by Zeus.
Ph. I'll run myself
And forage out whatever comes to hand.
Exit.
Bd. Heyday! Where now? The strange infatuation!
Enter *Xanthias*.
Xa. Psha! Rot the dog! To keep a cur like this!
Bd. What's happened now?
Xa. Why, has not *Labes* here
Got to the kitchen safe, and grabbed a cheese,
A rich Sicilian cheese, and bolted it?
Bd. Then that's the first indictment we'll bring on
Before my father: you shall prosecute.
Xa. Thank you, not I. This other Cur declares
If there's a charge, he'll prosecute with pleasure.
Bd. Bring them both here.
Xa. Yes, yes, sir, so I will.
Exit.
Enter *Philocleon*.

844–887

Bd. (to *Philocleon*) Hallo, what's this?
Ph. Pig-railings from the hearth.
Bd. Sacrilege, eh?
Ph. No, but I'd trounce some fellow
(As the phrase goes) even from the very hearth.
So call away: I'm keen for passing sentence.
Bd. Then now I'll fetch the cause-lists and the
pleadings.
Exit.
Ph. O these delays! You weary and wear me out.
I've long been dying to commence my furrows.
Bd. (re-entering) Now then!
Ph. Call on.
Bd. Yes, certainly.
Ph. And who
Is first in order?
Bd. Dash it, what a bother!
I quite forgot to bring the voting-urns.
Ph. Goodness! Where now?
Bd. After the urns.
Ph. Don't trouble,
I'd thought of that. I've got these ladling-bowls.
Bd. That's capital: then now methinks we have
All that we want. No, there's no water-piece.
Ph. Water-piece, quotha! Pray what call you this?
Bd. Well thought on, father: and with shrewd
home wit.
Ho, there within! some person bring me out
A pan of coals, and frankincense, and myrtle,
That so our business may commence with prayer.
Ch. We too, as ye offer the prayer and wine,
We too will call on the Powers Divine
To prosper the work begun;
For the battle is over and done,
And out of the fray and the strife today
Fair peace ye have nobly won.
Bd. Now hush all idle words and sounds profane.
Ch. O Pythian *Phoebus*, bright *Apollo*, deign
To speed this youth's design
Wrought here, these gates before,
And give us from our wanderings rest
And peace for evermore.
The shout of "To *Paean*" is raised.
Bd. *Aguieus*! My neighbour and hero and lord!
who dwellest in front of my vestibule gate,
I pray thee be graciously pleased to accept
the rite that we new for my father create.
O bend to a pliant and flexible mood
the stubborn and resolute oak of his will.
And into his heart, so crusty and tart,
a trifle of honey for syrup instil.
Endue him with sympathies wide,
A sweet and humane disposition,
Which leans to the side of the wretch that is
tried,
And weeps at a culprit's petition.
From harshness and anger to turn,
May it now be his constant endeavour,
And out of his temper the stern
Sharp sting of the nettle to sever.
Ch. We in thy prayers combine, and quite give in
To the new rule, for the aforesaid reasons.
Our heart has stood our friend
And loved you, since we knew

That you affect the people more
Than other young men do.

*Enter Xanthias with two persons as dogs.*

**BD.**
Is any Justice out there? Let him enter.

We shan’t admit him when they’ve once begun.

**PH.**
Where is the prisoner fellow? Won’t he catch it!

**BD.**
O yes! *Attention*! (Reads the indictment)
> “Cur of Cydathon
> Hereby accuses Labes of Aexone,
> For that, embezzling a Sicilian cheese,
> Alone he ate it. Fine, one fig-tree collar.”

**PH.**
Nay, but a dog’s death, an’ he’s once convicted.

**BD.**
Here stands, to meet the charge, the prisoner Labes.

**PH.**
O the vile wretch! O what a thievish look!
See how he grins, and thinks to take me in.
Where’s the Accuser, Cur of Cydathon?

**CUR.**
Bow!

**BD.**
Here he stands.

**XA.**
Another Labes this,
Good dog to yelp and lick the platters clean.

**BD.**
St! Take your seat, (to *Cur*)
Go up and prosecute.

**PH.**
Meanwhile I’ll ladle out and sip my gruel.

**XA.**
Ye have heard the charge, most honourable judges,
I bring against him. Scandalous the trick
He played us all, me and the Sailor-laddies.
Alone, in a corner, in the dark, he gorged,
And munched, and crunched, and *Sicilied* the cheese!

**PH.**
Pheugh! The thing’s evident: the brute this instant
Breathed in my face the filthiest whiff of cheese.
O the foul skunk!

**XA.**
And would not give me any,
Not though I asked. Yet can he be your friend
Who won’t throw anything to Me, the dog?

**PH.**
Not give you any! No, nor Me, the state.
The man’s a regular scorcher (burns his mouth),
like this gruel.

**BD.**
Come, don’t decide against us, pray don’t, father,
Before you’ve heard both sides.

**PH.**
But, my dear boy,
The thing’s self-evident, speaks for itself.

**XA.**
Don’t let him off; upon my life he is
The most lone-eatingest dog that ever was.
The brute went coasting round and round the mortar,
And snapped up all the rind off all the cities.

**PH.**
And I’ve no mortar even to mend my pitcher!

**XA.**
So then be sure you punish him. For why?
One bush, they say, can never keep two thieves.
Lest I should bark, and bark, and yet get nothing.
And if I do I’ll never bark again.

**PH.**
Soh! soh!
Here’s a nice string of accusations truly!
A rare thief of a man! You think so too,
Old gamecock? Ay, he winks his eye, he thinks so.
Archon! Hi, fellow, hand me down the vessel.

**BD.**
Reach it yourself; I’ll call my witnesses.
The witnesses for Labes, please stand forward!
Pot, pestle, grater, brazier, water-jug,
And all the other scarred and charred utensils.
(To *Philocleon*)
Good heavens, sir, finish there, and take your seat!

**PH.**
I guess I’ll finish him before I’ve done.

**BD.**
What! always hard and pitiless, and that
To the prisoners, always keen to bite!
(To *Labes*)
Up, plead your cause: what, quite dumbfounded? Speak.

**PH.**
Seems he’s got nothing in the world to say.

**BD.**
Nay, ’tis a sudden seizure, such as once
Attacked *Thucydides* when brought to trial.
’Tis tongue-paralysis that stops his jaws.
(To *Labes*)
Out of the way! I’ll plead your cause myself.
O sirs, ’tis hard to argue for a dog
Assailed by slander: nevertheless, I’ll try.
’Tis a good dog, and drives away the wolves.

**PH.**
A thief I call him, and conspirator.

**BD.**
Nay, he’s the best and worthiest dog alive,
Fit to take charge of any number o’ sheep.

**PH.**
What use in that, if he eat up the cheese?

**BD.**
Use! Why, he fights your battles, guards your door;
The best dog altogether. If he filched,
Yet O forgive: he never learnt the lyre.

**PH.**
I would to heaven he had never learned his letters,
Then he’d not given us all this tiresome speech.

**BD.**
Nay, nay, sir, hear my witnesses, I beg.
Grater, get in the box, and speak well out.
You kept the mess; I ask you, answer plainly,
Did you not grate the spoil between the soldiers?
He says he did.

**PH.**
Ay, but I vow he’s lying.

**BD.**
O sir, have pity upon poor toiling souls.
Our Labes here, he lives on odds and ends,
Bones, gristle: and is always on the go.
That other Cur is a mere stay-at-home,
Sits by the hearth, and when one brings aught in
Asks for a share: if he gets none, he bites.

**PH.**
O me, what ails me that I grow so soft!
Some ill’s afoot: I’m nearly giving in.

**BD.**
O, I beseech you, father, show some pity,
Don’t crush him quite. Where are his little cubs?

*Enter a group of children dressed as puppies.*

Up, little wretches, up; and whimpering there
Plead for your father; weep, implore, beseech.

**PH.** (deeply *affected*)
Get down, get down, get down, get down.

**BD.**
I will.
Yet that “get down,” I know, has taken in
A many men. However I’ll get down.

**PH.**
Dash it! This guzzling ain’t the thing at all.
Here was I shedding tears, and seems to me
Only because I have gorged myself with gruel.

**BD.**
Then will he not get off?

**PH.**
’Tis hard to know.

**BD.**
O take, dear father, take the kindlier turn.
Here, hold this vote: then with shut eyes dash by
To the Far Urn. O father, do acquit him.

**PH.**
No, no, my boy. I never learnt the lyre.

**BD.**
Here, let me lead you round the handiest way.

**PH.**
Is this the Nearer?

**BD.**
This is.

**PH.**
In she goes.

**BD.** (aside)
Duped, as I live! Acquits him by mistake!
(aloud)
I’ll do the counting.

**PH.**
Well, how went the battle?

**BD.**
We shall soon see. O Labes, you’re acquitted!
Why, how now, father?

**PH.** (faintly)
Water, give me water!

**BD.**
Hold up, sir, do.

**PH.**
Just tell me only this,
Is he indeed acquitted?

**BD.**
Yes.

**PH.**
I’m done for.

**BD.**
Don’t take it so to heart: stand up, sir, pray.

**PH.**
How shall I bear this sin upon my soul?
A man acquitted! What awaits me now?
Yet, O great gods! I pray you pardon me,
Unwilled I did it, not from natural bent.

**BD.**
And don’t begrudge it; for I’ll tend you well,
And take you, father, everywhere with me,
To feasts, to suppers, to the public games.
Henceforth in pleasure you shall spend your days,
And no *Hyperbolus* delude and mock you.
But go we in.

**PH.**
Yes, if you wish it, now.

*Exeunt all but chorus.*

**CHORUS**
Yea, go rejoicing your own good way,
  Wherever your path may be;
But you, ye numberless myriads, stay
  And listen the while to me.
Beware lest the truths I am going to say
  Unheeded to earth should fall;
For that were the part of a fool to play,
  And not your part at all.

Now all ye people attend and hear,
  if ye love a simple and genuine strain.
For now our poet, with right good will,
  of you, spectators, must needs complain.
Ye have wronged him much, he protests, a bard
  who had served you often and well before;
Partly, indeed, himself unseen,
  assisting others to please you more;
With the art of a *Eurycles*, weird and wild,
  he loved to dive in a stranger’s breast,
And pour from thence through a stranger’s lips
  full many a sparkling comical jest;
And partly at length in his own true form,
  as he challenged his fate by himself alone,
And the Muses whose bridled mouths he drave,
  were never another’s, were all his own.

And thus he came to a height of fame
  which none had ever achieved before,
Yet waxed not high in his own conceit,
  nor ever an arrogant mind he bore.
He never was found in the exercise-ground,
  corrupting the boys: he never complied
With the suit of some dissolute knave, who loathed
  that the vigilant lash of the bard should chide
His vile effeminate boy-love. No!
  he kept to his purpose pure and high,
That never the Muse, whom he loved to use,
  the villainous trade of a bawd should ply.
When first he began to exhibit plays,
  no paltry men for his mark he chose,
He came in the mood of a *Heracles* forth
  to grapple at once with the mightiest foes.
In the very front of his bold career
  with the jag-toothed Monster he closed in fight,
Though out of its fierce eyes flashed and flamed
  the glare of *Cynna’s* detestable light,
And a hundred horrible sycophants’ tongues
  were twining and flickering over its head,
And a voice it had like the roar of a stream
  which has just brought forth destruction and dread,
And a *Lamia’s* groin, and a camel’s loin,
  and foul as the smell of a seal it smelt.
But He, when the monstrous form he saw,
  no bribe he took and no fear he felt,
For you he fought, and for you he fights:
  and then last year with adventurous hand
He grappled besides with the Spectral Shapes,
  the Agues and Fevers that plagued our land;
That loved in the darksome hours of night
  to throttle fathers, and grandsires choke,
That laid them down on their restless beds,
  and against your quiet and peaceable folk
Kept welding together proofs and writs
  and oath against oath, till many a man
Sprang up, distracted with wild affright,
  and off in haste to the Polemarch ran.
Yet although such a champion as this ye had found,
  to purge your land from sorrow and shame,
Ye played him false when to reap, last year,
  the fruit of his novel designs he came,
Which, failing to see in their own true light,
  ye caused to fade and wither away.
And yet with many a deep libation,
  invoking *Bacchus*, he swears this day
That never a man, since the world began,
  has witnessed a cleverer comedy.
Yours is the shame that ye lacked the wit
  its infinite merit at first to see.
But none the less with the wise and skilled
  the bard his accustomed praise will get,
Though when he had distanced all his foes,
  his noble Play was at last upset.

But O for the future, my Masters, pray
  Show more regard for a genuine Bard
Who is ever inventing amusements new
  And fresh discoveries, all for you.
Make much of his play, and store it away,
  And into your wardrobe throw it
With the citrons sweet: and if this you do,
  Your clothes will be fragrant, the whole year through,
With the volatile wit of the Poet.

O of old renowned and strong,
  in the choral dance and song,
In the deadly battle throng,
  And in this, our one distinction,
  manliest we, mankind among!
Ah, but that was long ago:
  Those are days forever past:
Now my hairs are whitening fast,
  Whiter than the swan they grow.
Yet in these our embers low
  still some youthful fires must glow.
Better far our old-world fashion,
  Better far our ancient truth,
Than the curls and dissipation
  Of your modern youth.

Do you wonder, O spectators,
  thus to see me spliced and braced,
Like a wasp in form and figure,
  tapering inwards at the waist?
Why I am so, what’s the meaning
  of this sharp and pointed sting,
Easily I now will teach you,
  though you “knew” not anything.
We on whom this stern-appendage,
  this portentous tail is found,
Are the genuine old *Autochthons*,
  native children of the ground;
We the only true-born Attics,
  of the staunch heroic breed,
Many a time have fought for Athens,
  guarding her in hours of need;
When with smoke and fire and rapine
  forth the fierce Barbarian came,
Eager to destroy our wasps'-nests,
  smothering all the town in flame,
Out at once we rushed to meet him:
  on with shield and spear we went,
Fought the memorable battle,
  primed with fiery hardiment;
Man to man we stood, and, grimly,
  gnawed for rage our under lips.
Hah! their arrows hail so densely,
  all the sun is in eclipse!
Yet we drove their ranks before us,
  ere the fall of eventide:
As we closed, an owl flew o’er us,
  and the Gods were on our side!
Stung in jaw, and cheek, and eyebrow,
  fearfully they took to flight,
We behind them, we harpooning
  at their slops with all our might:
So that in barbarian countries,
  even now the people call
Attic wasps the best, and bravest,
  yea, the manliest tribe of all!

Mine was then a life of glory,
  never craven fear came o’er me
Every foeman quailed before me
As across the merry waters,
  fast the eager galleys bore me.
‘Twas not then our manhood’s test,
  Who can make a fine oration?
  Who is shrewd in litigation?
It was, “Who can row the best?”
Therefore did we batter down
  many a hostile Median town.
And ’twas we who for the nation
  Gathered in the tribute pay,
Which the younger generation
  Merely steal away.

You will find us very wasplike,
  if you scan us through and through,
In our general mode of living,
  and in all our habits too.
First, if any rash assailant
  dare provoke us, can there be
Any creature more vindictive,
  more irascible than we?
Then we manage all our business
  in a waspish sort of way,
Swarming in the Courts of Justice,
  gathering in from day to day,
Many where the Eleven invite us,
  many where the Archon calls,
Many to the great *Odeum*,
  many to the city walls.
There we lay our heads together,
  densely packed, and stooping low,
Like the grubs within their cells, with
  movement tremulous and slow.
And for ways and means in general
  we’re superlatively good,
Stinging every man about us,
  culling thence a livelihood.
Yet we’ve stingless drones amongst us,
  idle knaves who sit them still,
Shrink from work, and toil, and labour,
  stop at home, and eat their fill,
Eat the golden tribute-honey
  our industrious care has wrought.
This is what extremely grieves us,
  that a man who never fought
Should contrive our fees to pilfer,
  one who for his native land
Never to this day had oar, or
  lance, or blister in his hand.
Therefore let us for the future
  pass a little short decree,
“Whoso wears no sting shall never
  carry off the obols three.”

*Enter Philocleon and Bdelycleon.*

**PH.**
No! No! I’ll never put this off alive.
With this I was arrayed, and found my safety,
In the invasion of the great north wind.

**BD.**
You seem unwilling to accept a good.

**PH.**
’Tis not expedient; no, by Zeus, it is not.
’Twas but the other day I gorged on sprats
And had to pay three obols to the fuller.

**BD.**
Try it at all events: since once for all
Into my hands you have placed yourself for good.

**PH.**
What would you have me do?

**BD.**
Put off that cloak.
And wear this mantle in a cloak-like way.

**PH.**
Should we beget and bring up children then,
When here my son is bent on smothering me?

**BD.**
Come, take and put it on, and don’t keep chattering.

**PH.**
Good heavens! And what’s this misery of a thing?

**BD.**
Some call it *Persian*, others *Caunaces*.

**PH.**
There! And I thought it a *Thymaetian* rug.

**BD.**
No wonder: for you’ve never been to *Sardis*,
Else you’d have known it: now you don’t.

**PH.**
Who? I?
No more I do, by Zeus: it seemed to me
Most like an overwrap of *Morychus*.

**BD.**
Nay, in *Ecbatana* they weave this stuff.

**PH.**
What! Have they wool-guts in *Ecbatana*?

**BD.**
Tut, man: they weave it in their foreign looms
At wondrous cost: this very article
Absorbed with ease a talent’s weight of wool.

**PH.**
Why, then, wool-gatherer were its proper name
Instead of *Caunaces*.

**BD.**
Come, take it, take it,
Stand still and put it on.

**PH.**
O dear, O dear,
O what a sultry puff the brute breathed o’er me!

**BD.**
Quick, wrap it round you.

**PH.**
No, I won’t, that’s flat.
You had better wrap me in a stove at once.

**BD.**
Come then, I’ll throw it round you.
(to the *cloak*) You, begone.

**PH.**
Do keep a flesh-hook near.

**BD.**
A flesh-hook! Why?

**PH.**
To pull me out before I melt away.

**BD.**
Now off at once with those confounded shoes,
And on with these *Laconians*, instantly.

**PH.**
What I, my boy! I bring myself to wear
The hated foe’s insufferable—cloutings!

**BD.**
Come, sir, insert your foot, and step out firmly
In this *Laconian*.

**PH.**
’Tis too bad, it is,
To make a man set foot on hostile—leather.

**BD.**
Now for the other.

**PH.**
O no, pray not that,
I’ve a toe there, a regular *Lacon-hater*.

**BD.**
There is no way but this.

**PH.**
O luckless I,
Why I shan’t have, to bless my age, one—chilblain.

**BD.**
Quick, father, get them on; and then move forward
Thus, in an opulent swaggering sort of way.

**PH.**
Look then! Observe my attitudes: think which
Of all your opulent friends I walk most like.

**BD.**
Most like a pimple bandaged round with garlic.

**PH.**
Ay, ay, I warrant I’ve a mind for wriggling.

**BD.**
Come, if you get with clever well-read men
Could you tell tales, good gentlemanly tales?

**PH.**
Ay, that I could.

**BD.**
What sort of tales?

**PH.**
Why, lots,
As, first, how *Lamia* spluttered when they caught her.
And, next, *Cardopion*, how he swinged his mother.

**BD.**
Pooh, pooh, no legends: give us something human,
Some what we call domestic incident.

**PH.**
O, ay, I know a rare domestic tale,
“How once upon a time a cat and mouse—”

**BD.**
“O fool and clown,” *Theogenes* replied
Rating the scavenger, what! would you tell
Tales of a cat and mouse, in company!

**PH.**
What, then?

**BD.**
Some stylish thing, as how you went
With *Androcles* and *Cleisthenes*, surveying.

**PH.**
Why, bless the boy, I never went surveying,
Save once to *Paros*, at two obols a day.

**BD.**
Still you must tell how splendidly, for instance,
*Ephudion* fought the pancratiastic fight
With young *Ascondas*: how the game old man
Though grey, had ample sides, strong hands, firm flanks.
An iron chest.

**PH.**
What humbug! Could a man
Fight the *pancratium* with an iron chest!

**BD.**
This is the way our clever fellows talk.
But try another tack: suppose you sat
Drinking with strangers, what’s the pluckiest feat,
Of all your young adventures, you could tell them?

**PH.**
My pluckiest feat? O much my pluckiest, much,
Was when I stole away *Ergasion’s* vine-poles.

**BD.**
Tcha! Poles indeed! Tell how you slew the boar,
Or coursed the hare, or ran the torch-race, tell
Your gayest, youthfullest act.

**PH.**
My youthfullest action?
’Twas that I had, when quite a hobbledehoy,
With fleet *Phayllus*: and I caught him too:
Won by two votes. ’Twas for abuse, that action.

**BD.**
No more of that: but lie down there, and learn
To be convivial and companionable.

**PH.**
Yes; how lie down?

**BD.**
In an elegant graceful way.

**PH.**
Like this, do you mean?

**BD.**
No, not in the least like that.

**PH.**
How then?

**BD.**
Extend your knees, and let yourself
With practised ease subside along the cushions;
Then praise some piece of plate: inspect the ceiling;
Admire the woven hangings of the hall.
Ho! Water for our hands! Bring in the tables!
Dinner! The after-wash! Now the libation.

**PH.**
Good heavens! Then is it in a dream we are feasting?

**BD.**
The flute-girl has performed! Our fellow-guests
Are *Phanus*, *Aeschines*, *Theorus*, *Cleon*,
Another stranger at *Acestor’s* head.
Could you with these cap verses properly?

**PH.**
Could I? Ay, truly; no *Diacrian* better.

**BD.**
I’ll put you to the proof. Suppose I’m *Cleon*.
I’ll start the catch *Harmodius*. You’re to cap it.
(singing)
“Truly Athens never knew”

**PH.** (singing)
“Such a rascaly thief as you.”

**BD.**
Will you do that? You’ll perish in your noise.
He’ll swear he’ll fell you, quell you, and expel you
Out of this realm.

**PH.**
Ay, truly, will he so?
And if he threaten, I’ve another strain.
“Mon, lustin’ for power supreme, ye’ll mak’
The city capseeze; she’s noo on the shak’.”

**BD.**
What if *Theorus*, lying at his feet,
Should grasp the hand of *Cleon*, and begin,
“From the story of *Admetus* learn, my friend, to love the good.”
How will you take that on?

**PH.**
I, very neatly,
“It is not good the fox to play,
Nor to side with both in a false friend’s way.”

**BD.**
Next comes that son of *Sellus*, *Aeschines*,
Clever, accomplished fellow, and he’ll sing
“O the money, O the might,
How *Cleitagora* and I,
With the men of *Thessaly*”—

**PH.**
“How we boasted, you and I.”

**BD.**
Well, that will do: you’re fairly up to that:
So come along: we’ll dine at *Philoctemon’s*.
Boy! *Chrysus*! Pack our dinner up; and now
For a rare drinking-bout at last.

**PH.**
No, no,
Drinking ain’t good: I know what comes of drinking,
Breaking of doors, assault, and battery,
And then, a headache and a fine to pay.

**BD.**
Not if you drink with gentlemen, you know.
They’ll go to the injured man, and beg you off,
Or you yourself will tell some merry tale,
A jest from *Sybaris*, or one of *Aesop’s*,
Learned at the feast. And so the matter turns
Into a joke, and off he goes contented.

**PH.**
O I’ll learn plenty of those tales, if so
I can get off, whatever wrong I do.
Come, go we in: let nothing stop us now.

*Exeunt.*

**CHORUS**
Often have I deemed myself
  exceeding bright, acute, and clever,
Dull, obtuse, and awkward never.
That is what *Amynias* is,
  of Curling-borough, *Sellus’* son;
Him who now upon an apple
  and pomegranate dines, I saw
At *Leogoras’s* table
  Eat as hard as he was able,
Goodness, what a hungry maw!
Pinched and keen as *Antiphon*.

Once he travelled to *Pharsalus*,
  our ambassador to be,
There a solitary guest, he
Stayed with only the *Penestae*,
  Coming from the tribe himself,
  the kindred tribe, of Penury.

Fortunate *Automenes*, we envy your felicity;
Every son of yours is of an infinite dexterity:
First the Harper, known to all, and loved of all excessively,
Grace and wit attend his steps, and elegant festivity,
Next the Actor, shrewd of wit beyond all credibility:
Last of all *Ariphrades*, that soul of ingenuity,
He who of his native wit, with rare originality,
Hit upon an undiscovered trick of bestiality:
All alone, the father tells us, striking out a novel line.

Some there are who said that I
  was reconciled in amity,
When upon me *Cleon* pressed,
  and made me smart with injury,
Currying and tanning me:
  then as the stripes fell heavily
Th’ outsiders laughed to see the sport,
  and hear me squalling lustily,
Caring not a whit for me,
  but only looking merrily,
To know if squeezed and pressed I chanced
  to drop some small buffoonery.
Seeing this, I played the ape a little bit undoubtedly.
So then, after all, the Vine-pole
  proved unfaithful to the Vine.

*Enter Xanthias.*

**XA.**
O lucky tortoises, to have such skins,
Thrice lucky for the case upon your ribs:
How well and cunningly your backs are roofed
With tiling strong enough to keep out blows:
Whilst I, I’m cudgelled and tattooed to death.

**CH.**
How now, my boy? For though a man be old,
Still, if he’s beaten, we may call him boy.

**XA.**
Was not the old man the most outrageous nuisance,
Much the most drunk and riotous of all?
And yet we’d *Lycon*, *Antiphon*, *Hippyllus*,
*Lysistratus*, *Theophrastus*, *Phrynichus*;
But he was far the noisiest of the lot.
Soon as he’d gorged his fill of the good cheer,
He skipped, he leapt, and laughed, and frisked, and whinnied,
Just like a donkey on a feed of corn:
And slapped me youthfully, calling “Boy! Boy!”
So then *Lysistratus* compared him thus:
“Old man,” says he, “you’re like new wine fermenting,
Or like a sompnour, scampering to its bran.”
But he shrieked back, “And you, you’re like a locust
That has just shed the lappets of its cloak,
Or *Sthenelus*, shorn of his goods and chattels.”
At this all clapped, save *Theophrast*; but he
Made a wry face, being forsooth a wit.

“And pray,” the old man asked him, “what makes you
“Give yourself airs, and think yourself so grand,
You grinning flatterer of the well-to-do?”
Thus he kept bantering every guest in turn,
Making rude jokes, and telling idle tales,
In clownish fashion, relevant to nothing.
At last, well drunk, homeward he turns once more,
Aiming a blow at everyone he meets.
Ah! Here he’s coming; stumbling, staggering on.
Methinks I’ll vanish ere I’m slapped again.

*Enter Philocleon with a girl, and guest.*

**PH.**
Up ahoy! Out ahoy!
Some of you that follow me
  Shall ere long be crying.
If they don’t shog off, I swear
I’ll frizzle ’em all with the torch I bear,
  I’ll set the rogues a-frying.

**GUEST.**
Zounds! We’ll all make you pay for this to-morrow,
You vile old rake, however young you are!
We’ll come and cite and summon you all together.

**PH.**
Yah! Hah! Summon and cite!
The obsolete notion! Don’t you know
I’m sick of the names of your suits and claims.
Faugh! Faugh! Pheugh!
Here’s my delight!
Away with the verdict-box! Won’t he go?
Where’s the *Heliast*? Out of my sight!
My little golden chafer, come up here,
Hold by this rope, a rotten one perchance,
But strong enough for you. Mount up, my dear.
See now, how cleverly I filched you off,
A wanton hussy, flirting with the guests.
You owe me, child, some gratitude for that.
But you’re not one to pay your debts, I know.
O no! You’ll laugh and chaff and slip away,
That’s what you always do. But listen now,
Be a good girl, and don’t be disobliging,
And when my son is dead, I’ll ransom you,
And make you an honest woman. For indeed
I’m not yet master of my own affairs.
I am so young, and kept so very strict.
My son’s my guardian, such a cross-grained man,
A cummin-splitting, mustard-scraping fellow.
He’s so afraid that I should turn out badly,
For I’m in truth his only father now.
But here he runs. Belike he’s after us.
Quick, little lady, hold these links an instant;
And won’t I quiz him boyishly and well,
As he did me before the initiation.

**BD.**
You there! You there! You old lascivious dotard!
Enamoured, eh? Ay, of a fine ripe coffin.
Oh, by *Apollo*, you shall smart for this!

**PH.**
Dear, dear, how keen to taste a suit in pickle!

**BD.**
No quizzing, sir, when you have filched away
The flute-girl from our party.

**PH.**
Eh? What? Flute-girl?
You’re out of your mind, or out of your grave, or something.

**BD.**
Why, bless the fool, here’s *Dardanis* beside you!

**PH.**
What, this? Why, this is a torch in the marketplace!

**BD.**
A torch, man?

**PH.**
Clearly; pray observe the punctures.

**BD.**
Then what’s this black here, on the top of her head?

**PH.**
Oh, that’s the rosin, oozing while it burns.

**BD.**
Then this of course is not a woman’s arm?

**PH.**
Of course not; that’s a sprouting of the pine.

**BD.**
Sprouting be hanged.
(to *Dardanis*) You come along with me.

**PH.**
Hi! Hi! What are you at?

**BD.**
Marching her off
Out of your reach; a rotten, as I think,
And impotent old man.
(He leads girl into house.)

**PH.**
Now look ye here:
Once, when surveying at the *Olympian* games,
I saw how splendidly *Ephudion* fought
With young *Ascondas*: saw the game old man
Up with his fist, and knock the youngster down.
So mind your eye, or you’ll be pummelled too.

**BD.** (re-entering)
Troth, you have learned *Olympia* to some purpose.

*Enter Baking-Girl with Chaerephon.*

**B.-G.**
Oh, there he is! Oh, pray stand by me now!
There’s the old rascal who misused me so,
Banged with his torch, and toppled down from here
Bread worth ten obols, and four loaves to boot.

**BD.**
There now, you see; troubles and suits once more
Your wine will bring us.

**PH.**
Troubles? Not at all.
A merry tale or two sets these things right.
I’ll soon set matters right with this young woman.

**B.-G.**
No, by the Twain! You shan’t escape scot-free,
Doing such damage to the goods of *Myrtia*,
*Sostrata’s* daughter, and *Anchylion’s*, sir!

**PH.**
Listen, good woman: I am going to tell you
A pleasant tale.

**B.-G.**
Not me, by Zeus, sir, no!

**PH.**
At *Aesop*, as he walked one eve from supper,
There yapped an impudent and drunken bitch.
Then *Aesop* answered, “O you bitch! you bitch!

If in the stead of that ungodly tongue
You’d buy some wheat, methinks you’d have more sense.”

B.-G. Insult me too? I summon you before
The Market Court for damage done my goods,
And for my sompnour have this Chaerephon.

Ph. Nay, nay, but listen if I speak not fair.
Simonides and Lasus once were rivals.
Then Lasus says, “Pish, I don’t care,” says he.

B.-G. You will, sir, will you?

Ph. And you, Chaerephon,
Are you her sompnour, you, like fear-blanched Ino
Pendent before Euripides’s feet?

Exeunt baking-girl and Chaerephon.

1415-1461

Bd. See, here’s another coming, as I live,
To summon you: at least he has got his sompnour.

Enter Complainant.

Complainant. O dear! O dear! Old man, I summon you
For outrage.

Bd. Outrage? No, by the Gods, pray don’t.
I’ll make amends for everything he has done
(Ask what you will), and thank you kindly too.

Ph. Nay. I’ll make friends myself without compulsion.
I quite admit the assault and battery.
So tell me which you’ll do; leave it to me
To name the compensation I must pay
To make us friends, or will you fix the sum?

Co. Name it yourself: I want no suits nor troubles.

Ph. There was a man of Sybaris, do you know,
Thrown from his carriage, and he cracked his skull,
Quite badly too. Fact was, he could not drive.
There was a friend of his stood by, and said,
> “Let each man exercise the art he knows.”
So you, run off to Doctor Pittalus.

Bd. Ay, this is like the rest of your behaviour.

Co. (to Bdelycleon) You, sir, yourself, remember what he says.

Ph. Stop, listen. Once in Sybaris a girl
Fractured a jug.

Co. I call you, friend, to witness.

Ph. Just so the jug: it called a friend to witness.
Then said the girl of Sybaris, “By’r Lady, [^1]
If you would leave off calling friends to witness,
And buy a rivet, you would show more brains.”

Co. Jeer, till the Magistrate call on my case.

Exit.

Bd. No, by Demeter, but you shan’t stop here,
I’ll take and carry you—

Ph. What now!

Bd. What now?
Carry you in: or soon there won’t be sompnours
Enough for all your summoning complainants.

Ph. The Delphians once charged Aesop—

Bd. I don’t care.

Ph. With having filched a vessel of their God.
But Aesop up and told them that a beetle—

Bd. Zounds! but I’ll finish you, beetles and all.

Exeunt Philocleon and Bdelycleon.

Chorus
I envy much his fortune
As he changes from his dry
Ungenial life and manners,
Another path to try.
Now all to soft indulgence
His eager soul will take,
And yet perchance it will not,
For, ah! ’tis hard to break
From all your lifelong habits;
Yet some the change have made,
With other minds consorting,
By other counsels swayed.

[^1]: Persephone.

THE WASPS
1462-1501

With us and all good people
Great praise Philocleon’s son
For filial love and genius
In this affair has won.
Such sweet and gracious manners
I never saw before,
Nor ever with such fondness
My doting heart gushed o’er.
Where proved he not the victor
In all this wordy strife,
Seeking to raise his father
To higher paths of life?

Enter Xanthias.

Xa. O Dionysus! here’s a pretty mess
Into our house some power has whirligigged.
Soon as the old man heard the pipe, and drank
The long untasted wine, he grew so merry
He won’t stop dancing all the whole night through
Those strange old dances such as Thespis taught;
And your new bards he’ll prove old fools, he says,
Dancing against them in the lists directly.

Re-enter Philocleon and Bdelycleon.

Ph. Who sits, who waits at the entrance gates?

Xa. More and more is this evil advancing!

Ph. Be the bolts undone, we have just begun;
This, this is the first evolution of dancing.

Xa. First evolution of madness, I think.

Ph. With the strong contortion the ribs twist round,
And the nostril snorts, and the joints resound,
And the tendons crack.

Xa. O, hellebore drink!

Ph. Cock-like, Phrynichus crouches and cowers,

Xa. You’ll strike by and by.

Ph. Then he kicks his leg to the wondering sky,

Xa. O look to yourself, look out, look out.

Ph. For now in these sinewy joints of ours
The cup-like socket is twirled about.

Bd. ’Twon’t do, by Zeus: ’twon’t do: ’tis downright madness.

Ph. Come on, I challenge all the world to dance.
Now what tragedian thinks he dances well,
Let him come in and dance a match with me.
Well, is there one, or none?

Bd. Here’s only one.

Enter Dancer as a crab.

Ph. Who’s he, poor devil?

Bd. ’Tis the midmost son
Of poet Carcinus, the Crabbe.

Ph. I’ll eat him.
’Sdeath! I’ll destroy him with a knuckle-dance.
He’s a born fool at rhythm.

Bd. Nay, but look here!
Here comes a brother crab, another son
Of Carcinus.

Enter another Dancer.

Ph. ’Faith, I’ve got crab enough.

Bd. Nothing but crabs! ’fore Zeus, nothing but crabs!
Here creeps a third of Carcinus’s brood.

Ph. Heyday! what’s this? a vinaigrette, or spider?

Enter a third Dancer.

Bd. This is the Pinnoteer, of all the tribe
The tiniest crab: a tragic poet too!

Ph. O Carcinus! O proud and happy father!
Here’s a fine troop of wrynecks settling down.
Well, I must gird me to the fight: and you,
Mix pickles for these crabs, in case I beat them.

Ch. Come draw we aside, and leave them a wide,
a roomy and peaceable exercise-ground,
That before us therein like tops they may spin,
revolving and whirling and twirling around.
O lofty-titled sons of the ocean-roving sire,
Ye brethren of the shrimps, come and leap
On the sand and on the strand
of the salt and barren deep.
Whisk nimble feet around you;
kick out, till all admire,
The Phrynichean kick to the sky;
That the audience may applaud,
as they view your leg on high.
On, on, in mazy circles; hit your stomach with your heel
Fling legs aloft to heaven,
as like spinning-tops you wheel.
Your Sire is creeping onward, the Ruler of the Sea,
He gazes with delight at his hobby-dancers three.
Come, dancing as you are, if you like it, lead away,
For never yet, I warrant, has an actor till to-day
Led out a chorus, dancing, at the ending of the Play.
