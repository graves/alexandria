*On the borders of Argolis. Enter Peasant.*

**Peasant.**  
O Argos, ancient land, and streams of Inachus, whence on a day king Agamemnon sailed to the realm of Troy, carrying his warriors aboard a thousand ships; and after he had slain Priam who was reigning in Ilium and captured the famous city of Dardanus, he came hither to Argos and has set up high on the temple-walls many a trophy, spoil of the barbarians. Though all went well with him in Troy, yet was he slain in his own palace by the guile of his wife Clytaemnestra and the hand of Egisthus, son of Thyestes. So he died and left behind him the ancient sceptre of Tantalus, and Egisthus reigns in his stead, with the daughter of Tyndareus, Agamemnon’s queen, to wife.

Now as for those whom he left in his halls, when he sailed to Troy, his son Orestes and his tender daughter Electra— the boy Orestes, as he was like to be slain by Egisthus, his sire’s old foster-father secretly removed to the land of Phocis and gave to Strophius to bring up, but the maid Electra abode in her father’s house, and soon as she had budded into maidenhood, came all the princes of Hellas asking her hand in marriage. But Egisthus kept her at home for fear she might bear a son to some chieftain who would avenge Agamemnon, nor would he betroth her unto any. But when e’en thus there seemed some room for fear that she might bear some noble lord a child by stealth and Egisthus was minded to slay her, her mother, though she had a cruel heart, yet rescued the maiden from his hand. For she could find excuses for having slain her husband, but she feared the hatred she would incur for her children’s murder.

Wherefore Egisthus devised this scheme; on Agamemnon’s son who had escaped his realm by flight he set a price to be paid to any who should slay him, while he gave Electra to me in marriage, whose ancestors were citizens of Mycenae. It is not that I blame myself for; my family was noble enough, though certainly impoverished, and so my good birth suffers. By making for her this weak alliance he thought he would have little to fear. For if some man of high position had married her, he might have revived the vengeance for Agamemnon’s murder, which now is sleeping; in which case Egisthus would have paid the penalty. But Cypris is my witness that I have ever respected her maidenhood; she is still as though unwed. Unworthy as I am, honour forbids that I should so affront the daughter of a better man. Yea, and I am sorry for Orestes, hapless youth, who is called my kinsman, to think that he should ever return to Argos and behold his sister’s wretched marriage. And whoso counts me but a fool for leaving a tender maid untouched when I have her in my house, to him I say, he measures purity by the vicious standard of his own soul, a standard like himself.

*Enter Electra.*

**Electra.**  
O sable night, nurse of the golden stars! Beneath thy pall I go to fetch water from the brook with my pitcher poised upon my head, not indeed because I am reduced to this necessity, but that to the gods I may display the affronts Egisthus puts upon me, and to the wide firmament pour out my lamentation for my sire. For my own mother, the baleful daughter of Tyndareus, hath cast me forth from her house to gratify her lord; for since she hath born no other children to Egisthus she puts me and Orestes on one side at home.

**Peasant.**  
Oh! why, poor maiden, dost thou toil so hard on my behalf, thou that aforetime wert reared so daintily? Why canst thou not forego thy labour, as I bid thee?

**Electra.**  
As a god’s I count thy kindness to me, for in my distress thou hast never made a mock at me. ’Tis rare fortune when mortals find such healing balm for their cruel wounds as ’tis my lot to find in thee. Wherefore I ought, though thou forbid me, to lighten thy labours, as far as my strength allows, and share all burdens with thee to ease thy load. Thou hast enough to do abroad; ’tis only right that I should keep thy house in order. For when the toiler cometh to his home from the field, it is pleasant to find all comfortable in the house.

**Peasant.**  
If such thy pleasure, go thy way; for, after all, the spring is no great distance from my house. And at break of day I will drive my steers to my glebe and sow my crop. For no idler, though he has the gods’ names ever on his lips, can gather a livelihood without hard work.

*Exeunt Peasant and Electra.*

*Enter Orestes and Pylades.*

**Orestes.**  
Ah! Pylades, I put thee first ’mongst men for thy love, thy loyalty and friendliness to me; for thou alone of all my friends wouldst still honour poor Orestes, in spite of the grievous plight whereto I am reduced by Egisthus, who with my accursed mother’s aid slew my sire. I am come from Apollo’s mystic shrine to the soil of Argos, without the knowledge of any, to avenge my father’s death upon his murderers. Last night I went unto his tomb and wept thereon, cutting off my hair as an offering and pouring o’er the grave the blood of a sheep for sacrifice, unmarked by those who lord it o’er this land.

And now though I enter not the walled town, yet by coming to the borders of the land I combine two objects; I can escape to another country if any spy me out and recognize me, and at the same time seek my sister, for I am told she is a maid no longer but is married and living here, that I may meet her, and after enlisting her aid in the deed of blood, learn for certain what is happening in the town. Let us now, since dawn is uplifting her radiant eye, step aside from this path. For maybe some labouring man or serving maid will come in sight, of whom we may inquire whether it is here that my sister hath her home. Lo! yonder I see a servant bearing a full pitcher of water on her shaven head; let us sit down and make inquiry of this bondmaid, if haply we may glean some tidings of the matter which brought us hither, Pylades. (They retire a little)

*Re-enter Electra.*

**Electra.**  
Bestir thy lagging feet, ’tis high time; on, on o’er thy path of tears! Ah misery! I am Agamemnon’s daughter, she whom Clytaemnestra, hateful child of Tyndareus, bare; hapless Electra is the name my countrymen call me. Ah me! for my cruel lot, my hateful existence! O my father Agamemnon! in Hades art thou laid, butchered by thy wife and Egisthus. Come, raise with me that dirge once more; uplift the woful strain that brings relief. On, on o’er thy path of tears! Ah misery! And thou, poor brother, in what city and house art thou a slave, leaving thy suffering sister behind in the halls of our fathers to drain the cup of bitterness? Oh! come, great Zeus, to set me free from this life of sorrow, and to avenge my sire in the blood of his foes, bringing the wanderer home to Argos.

Take this pitcher from my head, put it down, that I may wake betimes, while it is yet night, my lamentation for my sire, my doleful chant, my dirge of death, for thee, my father in thy grave, which day by day I do rehearse, rending my skin with my nails, and smiting on my shaven head in mourning for thy death. Woe, woe! rend the cheek; like a swan with clear loud note beside the brimming river calling to its parent dear that lies a-dying in the meshes of the crafty net, so I bewail thee, my hapless sire, after that fatal bath of thine laid out most piteously in death.

Oh! the horror of that axe which hacked thee so cruelly, my sire! Oh! the bitter thought that prompted thy return from Troy! With no garlands or victor’s crowns did thy wife welcome thee, but with his two-edged sword she made thee the sad sport of Egisthus and kept her treacherous paramour.

*Enter Chorus of Argive Country-Women.*

**Chorus.**  
O Electra, daughter of Agamemnon, to thy rustic cot I come, for a messenger hath arrived, a highlander from Mycenae, one who lives on milk, announcing that the Argives are proclaiming a sacrifice for the third day from now, and all our maidens are to go to Hera’s temple.

**Electra.**  
Kind friends, my heart is not set on festivity, nor do necklaces of gold cause any flutter in my sorrowing bosom, nor will I stand up with the maidens of Argos to beat my foot in the mazy dance. Tears have been my meat day and night; ah misery! See my unkempt hair, my tattered dress; are they fit for a princess, a daughter of Agamemnon, or for Troy which once thought of my father as its captor?

**Chorus.**  
Mighty is the goddess; so come, and borrow of me broidered robes for apparel and jewels of gold that add a further grace to beauty’s charms. Dost think to triumph o’er thy foes by tears, if thou honour not the gods? ’Tis not by lamentation but by pious prayers to heaven that thou, my daughter, wilt make fortune smile on thee.

**Electra.**  
No god hearkens to the voice of lost Electra, or heeds the sacrifices offered by my father long ago. Ah woe for the dead! woe for the living wanderer, who dwelleth in some foreign land, an outcast and a vagabond at a menial board, sprung though he is of a famous sire! Myself, too, in a poor man’s hut do dwell, wasting my soul with grief, an exile from my father’s halls, here by the scarred hill-side; while my mother is wedded to a new husband in a marriage stained by blood.

**Chorus.**  
Many a woe to Hellas and thy house did Helen, thy mother’s sister, cause.

**Electra.**  
Ha! (Catching sight of Orestes and Pylades) Friends, I break off my lament; yonder are strangers just leaving the place of ambush where they were couching, and making for the house. We must seek to escape the villains by flying, thou along the path and I into my cottage.

**Orestes.**  
Stay, poor maid; fear no violence from me.

**Electra.**  
O Phoebus Apollo! I beseech thee spare my life.

**Orestes.**  
Give me the lives of others more my foes than thou!

**Electra.**  
Begone! touch me not! thou hast no right to.

**Orestes.**  
There is none I have better right to touch.

**Electra.**  
How is it then thou waylayest me, sword in hand, near my house?

**Orestes.**  
Wait and hear, and thou wilt soon agree with me.

**Electra.**  
Here I stand; I am in thy power in any case, since thou art the stronger.

**Orestes.**  
I am come to thee with news of thy brother.

**Electra.**  
O best of friends! is he alive or dead?

**Orestes.**  
Alive; I would fain give thee my good news first.

**Electra.**  
God bless thee! in return for thy welcome tidings.

**Orestes.**  
I am prepared to share that blessing between us.

**Electra.**  
In what land is my poor brother spending his dreary exile?

**Orestes.**  
His ruined life does not conform to the customs of any one city.

**Electra.**  
Surely he does not want for daily bread?

**Orestes.**  
Bread he has, but an exile is a helpless man at best.

**Electra.**  
What is this message thou hast brought from him?

**Orestes.**  
He asks, “Art thou alive? and if so, how art thou faring?”

**Electra.**  
Well, first thou seest how haggard I am grown—

**Orestes.**  
So wasted with sorrow that I weep for thee.

**Electra.**  
Next mark my head, shorn and shaven like a Scythian’s.

**Orestes.**  
Thy brother’s fate and father’s death no doubt distress thee.

**Electra.**  
Yes, alas! for what have I more dear than these?

**Orestes.**  
Ah! and what dost thou suppose is dearer to thy brother?

**Electra.**  
He is far away, not here to show his love to me.

**Orestes.**  
Wherefore art thou living here far from the city?

**Electra.**  
I am wedded, sir; a fatal match!

**Orestes.**  
Alas! for thy brother; I pity him. Is thy husband of Mycenae?

**Electra.**  
He is not the man to whom my father ever thought of betrothing me.

**Orestes.**  
Tell me all, that I may report it to thy brother.

**Electra.**  
I live apart from my husband in this house.

**Orestes.**  
The only fit inmate would be a hind or herd.

**Electra.**  
Poor he is, yet he displays a generous consideration for me.

**Orestes.**  
Why, what is this consideration that attaches to thy husband?

**Electra.**  
He has never presumed to claim from me a husband’s rights.

**Orestes.**  
Is he under a vow of chastity? or does he disdain thee?

**Electra.**  
He thought he had no right to flout my ancestry.

**Orestes.**  
How was it he was not overjoyed at winning such a bride?

**Electra.**  
He does not recognize the right of him who disposed of my hand.

**Orestes.**  
I understand; he was afraid of the vengeance of Orestes hereafter.

**Electra.**  
There was that fear, but he was a virtuous man as well.

**Orestes.**  
Ah! a noble nature this! He deserves kind treatment.

**Electra.**  
Yes, if ever the wanderer return.

**Orestes.**  
But did thy own mother give in to this?

**Electra.**  
’Tis her husband, not her children, that a woman loves, sir stranger.

**Orestes.**  
Wherefore did Egisthus put this affront on thee?

**Electra.**  
His design in giving me to such a husband was to weaken my offspring.

**Orestes.**  
To prevent thee bearing sons, I suppose, who should punish him?

**Electra.**  
That was his plan: God grant I may avenge me on him for it!

**Orestes.**  
Does thy mother’s husband know that thou art yet a maid?

**Electra.**  
He does not; our silence robs him of that knowledge.

**Orestes.**  
Are these women friends of thine, who overhear our talk?

**Electra.**  
They are, and they will keep our conversation perfectly secret.

**Orestes.**  
What could Orestes do in this matter, if he did return?

**Electra.**  
Canst thou ask? Shame on thee for that! Is not this the time for action?

**Orestes.**  
But suppose he comes, how could he slay his father’s murderers?

**Electra.**  
By boldly meting out the same fate that his father had meted out to him by his foes.

**Orestes.**  
Wouldst thou be brave enough to help him slay his mother?

**Electra.**  
Aye, with the self-same axe that drank my father’s blood.

**Orestes.**  
Am I to tell him this, and that thy purpose firmly holds?

**Electra.**  
Once I have shed my mother’s blood o’er his, then welcome death!

**Orestes.**  
Ah! would Orestes were standing near to hear that!

**Electra.**  
I should not know him, sir, if I saw him.

**Orestes.**  
No wonder; you were both children when you parted.

**Electra.**  
There is only one of my friends would recognize him.

**Orestes.**  
The man maybe who is said to have snatched him away from being murdered?

**Electra.**  
Yes, the old servant who tended my father’s childhood long ago.

**Orestes.**  
Did thy father’s corpse obtain burial?

**Electra.**  
Such burial as it was, after his body had been flung forth from the palace.

**Orestes.**  
O God! how awful is thy story! Yes, there is a feeling, arising even from another’s distress, that wrings the human heart. Say on, that when I know the loveless tale, which yet I needs must hear, I may carry it to thy brother. For pity, though it has no place in clownish natures, is inborn in the wise; still it may cause mischief to find excessive cleverness amongst the wise.

**Chorus.**  
I too am animated by the same desire as the stranger. For dwelling so far from the city I know nothing of the town’s scandals, and I should like to hear about them now myself.

**Electra.**  
I will tell you, if I may; and surely I may tell a friend about my own and my father’s grievous misfortunes. Now since thou movest me to speak, I entreat thee, sir, tell Orestes of our sorrows; first, describe the dress I wear, the load of squalor that oppresses me, the hovel I inhabit after my royal home; tell him how hard I have to work at weaving clothes myself or else go barely clad and do without; how I carry home on my head water from the brook; no part have I in holy festival, no place amid the dance; a maiden still I turn from married dames and from Castor too, to whom they betrothed me before he joined the heavenly host, for I was his kinswoman. Meantime my mother, ’mid the spoils of Troy, is seated on her throne, and at her footstool slaves from Asia stand and wait, captives of my father’s spear, whose Trojan robes are fastened with brooches of gold. And there on the wall my father’s blood still leaves a deep dark stain, while his murderer mounts the dead man’s car and fareth forth, proudly grasping in his blood-stained hands the sceptre with which Agamemnon would marshal the sons of Hellas. Dishonoured lies his grave; naught as yet hath it received a drink outpoured or myrtle-spray, but bare of ornament his tomb is left. Yea, and ’tis said that noble hero who is wedded to my mother, in his drunken fits, doth leap upon the grave, and pelt with stones my father’s monument, boldly gibing at us on this wise, “Where is thy son Orestes? Is he ever coming in his glory to defend thy tomb?” Thus is Orestes flouted behind his back. Oh! tell him this, kind sir, I pray thee. And there be many calling him to come—I am but their mouthpiece—these suppliant hands, this tongue, my broken heart, my shaven head, and his own father too. For ’tis shameful that the sire should have exterminated Troy’s race and the son yet prove too weak to pit himself against one foe unto the death, albeit he has youth and better blood to boot.

**Chorus.**  
Lo! here is thy husband hurrying homeward, his day’s work done.

**Peasant.** (Entering and catching sight of strangers talking to Electra)  
Ha! who are these strangers I see at my door? And why are they come hither to my rustic gate? Can they want my help? for ’tis unseemly for a woman to stand talking with young men.

**Electra.**  
Dear husband, be not suspicious of me. For thou shalt hear the truth; these strangers have come to bring me news of Orestes. Good sirs, pardon him those words.

**Peasant.**  
What say they? is that hero yet alive and in the light of day?

**Electra.**  
He is; at least they say so, and I believe them.

**Peasant.**  
Surely then he hath some memory of his father and thy wrongs?

**Electra.**  
These are things to hope for; a man in exile is helpless.

**Peasant.**  
What message have they brought from Orestes?

**Electra.**  
He sent them to spy out my evil case.

**Peasant.**  
Well, they only see a part of it, though maybe thou art telling them the rest.

**Electra.**  
They know all; there is nothing further they need ask.

**Peasant.**  
Long ere this then shouldst thou have thrown open our doors to them. Enter, sirs; for in return for your good tidings, shall ye find such cheer as my house affords. Ho! servants, take their baggage within; make no excuses, for ye are friends sent by one I love; and poor though I am, yet will I never show meanness in my habits.

**Orestes.**  
’Fore heaven! is this the man who is helping thee to frustrate thy marriage, because he will not shame Orestes?

**Electra.**  
This is he whom they call my husband, woe is me!

**Orestes.**  
Ah! there is no sure mark to recognize a man’s worth; for human nature hath in it an element of confusion. For instance, I have seen ere now the son of a noble sire prove himself a worthless knave, and virtuous children sprung from evil parents; likewise dearth in a rich man’s spirit, and in a poor man’s frame a mighty soul. By what standard then shall we rightly judge these things? By wealth? An evil test to use. By poverty then? Nay, poverty suffers from this, that it teaches a man to play the villain from necessity. To martial prowess must I turn? But who could pronounce who is the valiant man merely from the look of his spear? Better is it to leave these matters to themselves without troubling. For here is a man of no account in Argos, with no family reputation to boast, one of the common herd, proved a very hero. A truce to your folly! ye self-deceivers, swollen with idle fancies; learn to judge men by their converse, and by their habits decide who are noble. Such are they who rule aright both states and families; while those forms of flesh, devoid of intellect, are but figure-heads in the marketplace. The strong arm, again, no more than the weak awaits the battle-shock, for this depends on natural courage. Well! absent or present, Agamemnon’s son, whose business brings us here, deserves this of us, so let us accept a lodging in this house. (Calling to his servants) Ho! sirrahs, go within. A humble host, who does his best, in preference to a wealthy man for me! And so I thankfully accept this peasant’s proffered welcome, though I could have preferred that thy brother were conducting me to share his fortune in his halls. Maybe he yet will come; for the oracles of Loxias are sure, but to man’s divining “Farewell” say I.

*Exeunt Orestes and Pylades.*

**Chorus.**  
Electra, I feel a warmer glow of joy suffuse my heart than ever heretofore; perchance our fortune, moving on at last, will find a happy resting-place.

**Electra.**  
O reckless man, why didst thou welcome strangers like these, so far beyond thy station, knowing the poverty of thy house?

**Peasant.**  
Why? if they are really as noble as they seem, surely they will be equally content with rich or humble fare.

**Electra.**  
Well, since thou hast made this error, poor man as thou art, go to my father’s kind old foster-sire; on the bank of the river Tanaus, the boundary ’twixt Argos and the land of Sparta, he tends his flocks, an outcast from the city; bid him come hither to our house and make some provision for the strangers’ entertainment. Glad will he be, and will offer thanks to heaven to hear that the child, whom once he saved, is yet alive. I shall get nothing from my mother from my ancestral halls; for we should rue our message, were she to learn, unnatural wretch! that Orestes liveth.

**Peasant.**  
I will take this message to the old man, if it seem good to thee; but get thee in at once and there make ready. A woman, when she chooses, can find dainties in plenty to garnish a feast. Besides, there is quite enough in the house to satisfy them with victuals for one day at least. ’Tis in such cases, when I come to muse thereon, that I discern the mighty power of wealth, whether to give to strangers, or to expend in curing the body when it falls sick; but our daily food is a small matter; for all of us, rich as well as poor, are in like case, as soon as we are satisfied.

*Exeunt Electra and Peasant.*

**Chorus.**  
Ye famous ships, that on a day were brought to land at Troy by those countless oars, what time ye led the Nereid’s dance, where the dolphin music-loving rolled and gambolled round your dusky prows, escorting Achilles, nimble son of Thetis, when he went with Agamemnon to the banks of Trojan Simois; when Nereids left Euboea’s strand, bringing from Hephaestus’ golden forge the harness he had fashioned for that warrior’s use; him long they sought o’er Pelion and Ossa’s spurs, ranging the sacred glens and the peaks of Nymphaea, where his knightly sire was training up a light for Hellas, even the sea-born son of Thetis, a warrior swift to help the sons of Atreus.

One that came from Ilium, and set foot in the haven of Nauplia, told me that on the circle of thy far-famed targe, O son of Thetis, was wrought this blazon, a terror to the Phrygians; on the rim of the buckler Perseus, with winged sandals, was bearing in his hand across the main the Gorgon’s head, just severed by the aid of Hermes, the messenger of Zeus, that rural god whom Maia bore; while in the centre of the shield the sun’s bright orb flashed light on the backs of his winged coursers; there too was the heavenly choir of stars, Pleiades and Hyades, to dazzle Hector’s eyes and make him flee; and upon his gold-forged helm were sphinxes, bearing in their talons the prey of which the minstrels sing (i.e., carrying off a man); on his breast-plate was a lioness breathing flame, her eye upon Peirene’s steed, in eagerness to rend it. There too in murderous fray four-footed steeds were prancing, while o’er their backs uprose dark clouds of dust. But he who led these warriors stout, was slain by wedding thee, malignant child of Tyndareus! Wherefore shall the gods of heaven one day send thee to thy doom, and I shall yet live to see the sword at thy throat, drinking its crimson tide.

*Enter Old Man.*

**Old Man.**  
Where is the young princess, my mistress, Agamemnon’s daughter, whom I nursed in days gone by? Oh! how steep is the approach to this house, a hard climb for these old wasted feet of mine! Still, to reach such friends as these, I must drag my bent old back and tottering knees up it. Ah, daughter!—for I see thee now at thy door—lo!

I have brought thee this tender lamb from my own flock, having taken it from its dam, with garlands too and cheese straight from the press, and this flask of choice old wine with fragrant bouquet; ’tis small perhaps, but pour a cup thereof into some weaker drink, and it is a luscious draught. Let some one carry these gifts into the house for the guests;

for I would fain wipe from my eyes the rising tears
on this tattered cloak.

El. Why stands the tear-drop in thine eye, old
friend? Is it that my sorrows have been recalled to
thee after an interval? Or art thou bewailing the sad
exile of Orestes, and my father’s fate, whom thou
didst once fondle in thy arms, in vain, alas! for thee
and for thy friends?

O.M. Ah yes! in vain; but still I could not bear to
leave him thus; and so I added this to my journey
that I sought his grave, and, falling thereupon, wept
o’er its desolation; then did I open the wine-skin,
my gift to thy guests, and poured a libation, and set
myrtle-sprigs round the tomb. And lo! upon the
grave itself I saw a black ram had been offered, and
there was blood, not long poured forth, and severed
locks of auburn hair. Much I wondered, my daughter,
who had dared approach the tomb; certainly
'twas no Argive. Nay, thy brother may perchance
have come by stealth, and going thither have done
honour to his father’s wretched grave. Look at the
hair, compare it with thy own, to see if the colour
of these cut locks is the same; for children in whose
veins runs the same father’s blood, have usually a
close bodily resemblance in most points.

El. Old sir, thy words are unworthy of a wise
man, if thou thinkest my own brave brother would
have come to this land by stealth for fear of Aegisthus.
In the next place how should our hair correspond?
His is the hair of a gallant youth trained up
in manly sports, mine a woman’s curled and combed;
nay, that is a hopeless clue. Besides, thou couldst
find many, whose hair is of the same colour, albeit
not sprung from the same blood. No, maybe 'twas
some stranger cut off his hair in pity at his tomb,
or one that came to spy this land privily.

O.M. Put thy foot in the print of his shoe
and mark whether it correspond with thine, my
child.

El. How should the foot make any impression on
stony ground? And if it did, the foot of brother and
sister would not be the same in size, for a man’s is
the larger.

O.M. Hast thou no mark, in case thy brother
should come, whereby to recognize the weaving of
thy loom, the robe wherein I snatched him from
death that day?

El. Dost thou forget I was still a babe when Orestes
left the country? And even if I had woven him
a robe, how should he, a mere child then, be wearing
the same now, unless our clothes and bodies
grow together?

O.M. Where are these guests? I fain would question
them face to face about thy brother.

El. There they are, in haste to leave the house.

*Enter Orestes and Pylades.*

O.M. Wellborn, it seems, but that may be a
sham; for there be plenty such prove knaves. Still
I give them greeting.

Or. All hail, father! To which of thy friends, Electra,
does this old relic of mortality belong?

El. This is he who nursed my sire, sir stranger.

Or. What! Do I behold him who removed thy
brother out of harm’s way?

El. Behold the man who saved his life; if, that is,
he liveth still.

Or. Ha! Why does he look so hard at me, as if he
were examining the bright device on silver coin?
Is he finding in me a likeness to some other?

El. Maybe he is glad to see in thee a companion of
Orestes.

Or. A man I love full well. But why is he walking
round me?

El. I, too, am watching his movements with amaze,
sir stranger.

O.M. My honoured mistress, my daughter Electra,
return thanks to heaven—

El. For past or present favours? Which?

O.M. That thou hast found a treasured prize,
which God is now revealing.

El. Hear me invoke the gods. But what dost thou
mean, old man?

O.M. Behold before thee, my child, thy nearest
and dearest.

El. I have long feared thou wert not in thy sound
senses.

O.M. Not in my sound senses, because I see thy
brother?

El. What mean’st thou, aged friend, by these
astounding words?

O.M. That I see Orestes, Agamemnon’s son, before me.

El. What mark dost see that I can trust?

O.M. A scar along his brow, where he fell and cut
himself one day in his father’s home when chasing
a fawn with thee.

El. Is it possible? True; I see the mark of the fall.

O.M. Dost hesitate then to embrace thy own
dear brother?

El. No! Not any longer, old friend; for my soul is
convinced by the tokens thou showest. O my brother,
thou art come at last, and I embrace thee, little as
I ever thought to.

Or. And thee to my bosom at last I press.

El. I never thought that it would happen.

Or. All hope in me was also dead.

El. Art thou really he?

Or. Aye, thy one and only champion, if I can but
safely draw to shore the cast I mean to throw; and
I feel sure I shall; else must we cease to believe in
gods, if wrong is to triumph o’er right.

Ch. At last, at last appears thy radiant dawn, O
happy day! And as a beacon to the city hast thou
revealed the wanderer, who, long ago, poor boy!
was exiled from his father’s halls. Now, lady, comes
our turn for victory, ushered in by some god. Raise
hand and voice in prayer, beseech the gods that
good fortune may attend thy brother’s entry to the
city.

Or. Enough! Sweet though the rapture of this
greeting be, I must wait and return it hereafter. Do
thou, old friend so timely met, tell me how I am
to avenge me on my father’s murderer, and on my
mother, the partner in his guilty marriage. Have I
still in Argos any band of kindly friends? Or am I,
like my fortunes, bankrupt altogether? With whom
am I to league myself? By night or day shall I
advance? Point out a road for me to take against these
foes of mine.

O.M. My son, thou hast no friend now in thy
hour of adversity. No! That is a piece of rare good
luck, to find another share thy fortunes alike for
better and for worse. Thou art of every friend completely
reft, all hope is gone from thee; be sure of
what I tell thee; on thy own arm and fortune art
thou wholly thrown to win thy father’s home and
thy city.

Or. What must I do to compass this result?

O.M. Slay Thyestes’ son and thy mother.

Or. I came to win that victor’s crown, but how
can I attain it?

O.M. Thou wouldst never achieve it if thou didst
enter the walls.

Or. Are they manned with guards and armed
sentinels?

O.M. Aye truly; for he is afraid of thee, and cannot
sleep secure.

Or. Well then, do thou next propose a scheme,
old friend.

O.M. Hear me a moment; an idea has just occurred
to me.

Or. May thy counsel prove good, and my perception
keen!

O.M. I saw Aegisthus, as I was slowly pacing
hither—

Or. I welcome thy words. Where was he?

O.M. Not far from these fields, at his stables.

Or. What was he doing? I see a gleam of hope
after our dilemma.

O.M. I thought he was preparing a feast for the
Nymphs.

Or. In return for the bringing up of children or
in anticipation of a birth?

O.M. All I know is this, he was preparing to sacrifice
oxen.

Or. How many were with him? Or was he alone
with his servants?

O.M. There was no Argive there; only a band of
his own followers.

Or. Is it possible that any of them will recognize
me, old man?

O.M. They are only servants, and they have never
even seen thee.

Or. Will they support me, if I prevail?

O.M. Yes, that is the way of slaves, luckily for
thee.

Or. On what pretext can I approach him?

O.M. Go to some place where he will see thee as
he sacrifices.

Or. His estate is close to the road then, I
suppose.

O.M. Yes, and when he sees thee there, he will
invite thee to the feast.

Or. So help me God! He shall rue his invitation.

O.M. After that, form thy own plan according to
circumstances.

Or. Good advice! But my mother, where is she?

O.M. At Argos; but she will yet join her husband
for the feast.

Or. Why did she not come forth with him?

O.M. From fear of the citizens’ reproach she
stayed behind.

Or. I understand; she knows that the city suspects
her.

O.M. Just so; her wickedness makes her hated.

Or. How shall I slay her and him together?

El. Mine be the preparation of my mother’s slaying!

Or. Well, as for that other matter, fortune will
favour us.

El. Our old friend here must help us both.

O.M. Aye, that will I; but what is thy scheme for
slaying thy mother?

El. Go, old man, and tell Clytaemnestra from me
that I have given birth to a son.

O.M. Some time ago, or quite recently?

El. Ten days ago, which are the days of my purification.

O.M. Suppose it done; but how doth this help
towards slaying thy mother?

El. She will come, when she hears of my confinement.

O.M. What! Dost think she cares aught for thee,
my child?

El. Oh yes! She will weep no doubt over my
child’s low rank.

O.M. Perhaps she may; but go back again to the
point.

El. Her death is certain, if she comes.

O.M. In that case, let her come right up to the
door of the house.

El. Why then it were a little thing to turn her
steps into the road to Hades’ halls.

O.M. Oh! To see this one day, then die!

El. First of all, old friend, act as my brother’s
guide.

O.M. To the place where Aegisthus is now sacrificing
to the gods?

El. Then go, find my mother and give her my
message.

O.M. Aye that I will, so that she shall think the
very words are thine.

El. *(To Orestes)* Thy work begins at once; thou
hast drawn the first lot in the tragedy.

Or. I will go, if someone will show me the way.

O.M. I will myself conduct thee nothing loth.

Or. O Zeus, god of my fathers, vanquisher of my
foes, have pity on us, for a piteous lot has ours been.

El. Oh! Have pity on thy own descendants.

Or. O Hera, mistress of Mycenae’s altars, grant
us the victory, if we are asking what is right.

El. Yes, grant us vengeance on them for our
father’s death.

Or. Thou too, my father, sent to the land of
shades by wicked hands, and Earth, the queen of
all, to whom I spread my suppliant palms, up and
champion thy dear children. Come with all the dead
to aid, all they who helped thee break the Phrygians’
power, and all who hate ungodly crime. Dost hear
me, father, victim of my mother’s rage?

El. Sure am I he heareth all; but 'tis time to part.
For this cause too I bid thee strike Aegisthus down,
because, if thou fall in the struggle and perish, I also
die; no longer number me amongst the living; for
I will stab myself with a two-edged sword. And now
will I go indoors and make all ready there, for, if
there come good news from thee, my house shall
ring with women’s cries of joy; but, if thou art slain,
a different scene must then ensue. These are my
instructions to thee.

Or. I know my lesson well.

El. Then show thyself a man. *(Exeunt Orestes, Pylades, and Old Man)* And you, my friends, signal
to me by cries the certain issue of this fray.
Myself will keep the sword ready in my grasp, for
I will never accept defeat, and yield my body to my
enemies to insult. *Exit Electra.*

Ch. Still the story finds a place in time-honoured
legends, how on a day Pan, the steward of husbandry,
came breathing dulcet music on his jointed pipe,
and brought with him from its tender dam on Argive
hills, a beauteous lamb with fleece of gold; then
stood a herald high upon the rock and cried aloud,
“Away to the place of assembly, ye folk of Mycenae!
to behold the strange and awful sight vouchsafed
to our blest rulers.” Anon the dancers did obeisance
to the family of Atreus; the altar-steps of beaten
gold were draped; and through that Argive town
the altars blazed with fire; sweetly rose the lute’s
clear note, the handmaid of the Muse’s song; and
ballads fair were written on the golden lamb, saying
that Thyestes had the luck; for he won the guilty
love of the wife of Atreus, and carried off to his
house the strange creature, and then coming before
the assembled folk he declared to them that he had
in his house that horned beast with fleece of gold.
In the self-same hour it was that Zeus changed the
radiant courses of the stars, the light of the sun, and
the joyous face of dawn, and drave his car athwart
the western sky with fervent heat from heaven’s
fires, while northward fled the rainclouds, and Ammon’s
strand grew parched and faint and void of
dew, when it was robbed of heaven’s genial showers.
'Tis said, though I can scarce believe it, the sun
turned round his glowing throne of gold, to vex the
sons of men by this change because of the quarrel
amongst them. Still, tales of horror have their use
in making men regard the gods; of whom thou hadst
no thought, when thou slewest thy husband, thou
mother of this noble pair.

Hark! my friends, did ye hear that noise, like
to the rumbling of an earthquake, or am I the dupe
of idle fancy? Hark! hark! once more that wind-borne
sound swells loudly on mine ear. Electra! Mistress
mine! Come forth from the house!

*Enter Electra.*

El. What is it, good friends? How goes the day
with us?

Ch. I hear the cries of dying men; no more I
know.

El. I heard them too, far off, but still distinct.

Ch. Yes, the sound came stealing from afar, but
yet 'twas clear.

El. Was it the groan of an Argive, or of my friends?

Ch. I know not; for the cries are all confused.

El. That word of thine is my death-warrant; why
do I delay?

Ch. Stay, till thou learn thy fate for certain.

El. No, no; we are vanquished; where are our
messengers?

Ch. They will come in time; to slay a king is no
light task.

*Enter Messenger.*

Messenger. All hail! Ye victors, maidens of Mycenae,
to all Orestes’ friends his triumph I announce;
Aegisthus, the murderer of Agamemnon, lies weltering
where he fell; return thanks to heaven.

El. Who art thou? What proof dost thou give of
this?

Me. Look at me, dost thou not recognize thy
brother’s servant?

El. O best of friends! 'Twas fear that prevented
me from recognizing thee; now I know thee well.
What sayst thou? Is my father’s hateful murderer
slain?

Me. He is; I repeat it since it is thy wish.

Ch. Ye gods, and Justice, whose eye is on all, at
last art thou come.

El. I fain would learn the way and means my
brother took to slay Thyestes’ son.

Me. After we had set out from this house, we
struck into the broad high-road, and came to the
place where was the far-famed King of Mycenae.
Now he was walking in a garden well-watered, culling
a wreath of tender myrtle-sprays for his head,
and when he saw us, he called out, “All hail! Strangers;
who are ye? Whence come ye? From what
country?” To him Orestes answered, “We are from
Thessaly, on our way to Alpheus’ banks to sacrifice
to Olympian Zeus.” When Aegisthus heard that, he
said, “Ye must be my guests to-day, and share the
feast, for I am even now sacrificing to the Nymphs;
and by rising with tomorrow’s light ye will be just
as far upon your journey; now let us go within.”
Therewith he caught us by the hand and led us by
the way; refuse we could not; and when we were
come to the house, he gave command: “Bring water
for my guests to wash forthwith, that they may
stand around the altar near the laver.” But Orestes
answered, “'Twas but now we purified ourselves
and washed us clean in water from the river. So if
we strangers are to join your citizens in sacrifice, we
are ready, King Aegisthus, and will not refuse.” So
ended they their private conference. Meantime the
servants, that composed their master’s bodyguard,
laid aside their weapons, and one and all were busied
at their tasks. Some brought the bowl to catch the
blood, others took up baskets, while others kindled
fire and set cauldrons round about the altars, and
the whole house rang. Then did thy mother’s husband
take the barley for sprinkling, and began casting
it upon the hearth with these words, “Ye
Nymphs, who dwell among the rocks, grant that I
may often sacrifice with my wife, the daughter of
Tyndareus within my halls, as happily as now, and
ruin seize my foes!” (whereby he meant Orestes
and thyself.) But my master, lowering his voice,
offered a different prayer, that he might regain his
father’s house. Next Aegisthus took from a basket
a long straight knife, and cutting off some of the
calf’s hair, laid it with his right hand on the sacred
fire, and then cut its throat when the servants had
lifted it upon their shoulders, and thus addressed
thy brother; “Men declare that amongst the Thessalians
this is counted honourable, to cut up a bull
neatly and to manage steeds. So take the knife, sir
stranger, and show us if rumour speaks true about
the Thessalians.” Thereon Orestes seized the Dorian
knife of tempered steel and cast from his shoulders
his graceful buckled robe; then choosing Pylades to
help him in his task, he made the servants withdraw,
and catching the calf by the hoof, proceeded
to lay bare its white flesh, with arm outstretched,
and he flayed the hide quicker than a runner ever
finishes the two laps of the horses’ race-course; next
he laid the belly open, and Aegisthus took the entrails
in his hands and carefully examined them.
Now the liver had no lobe, while the portal vein
leading to the gall-bladder, portended a dangerous
attack on him who was observing it. Dark grows
Aegisthus’ brow, but my master asks, “Why so despondent,
good sir?” Said he, “I fear treachery from
a stranger. Agamemnon’s son of all men most I hate,
and he hates my house.” But Orestes cried, “What!
Fear treachery from an exile! Thou the ruler of the
city? Ho! Take this Dorian knife away and bring me
a Thessalian cleaver, that we by sacrificial feast may
learn the will of heaven; let me cleave the breastbone.”
And he took the axe and cut it through.
Now Aegisthus was examining the entrails, separating
them in his hands, and as he was bending down, thy
brother rose on tiptoe and smote him on the spine,
severing the vertebrae of his back; and his body
gave one convulsive shudder from head to foot and
writhed in the death-agony. No sooner did his servants
see it, than they rushed to arms, a host to fight
with two; yet did Pylades and Orestes of their valiancy
meet them with brandished spears. Then cried
Orestes, “I am no foe that come against this city
and my own servants, but I have avenged me on the
murderer of my sire, I, ill-starred Orestes. Slay me
not, my father’s former thralls!” They, when they
heard him speak, restrained their spears, and an old
man, who had been in the family many a long year,
recognized him. Forthwith they crown thy brother
with a wreath, and utter shouts of joy. And lo! He is
coming to show thee the head, not the Gorgon’s,
but the head of thy hated foe Aegisthus; his death
to-day has paid in blood a bitter debt of blood.

Ch. Dear mistress, now with step as light as fawn
join in the dance; lift high the nimble foot and be
glad. Victory crowns thy brother; he hath won a
fairer wreath than ever victor gained beside the
streams of Alpheus; so raise a fair hymn to victory,
the while I dance.

El. O light of day! O bright careering sun! O
earth! And night erewhile my only day! Now may I
open my eyes in freedom, for Aegisthus is dead, my
father’s murderer. Come friends, let me bring out
whate’er my house contains to deck his head and
wreath with crowns my conquering brother’s brow.

Ch. Bring forth thy garlands for his head, and we
will lead the dance the Muses love. Now shall the
royal line, dear to us in days gone by, resume its
sway o’er the realm, having laid low the usurper as
he deserves. So let the shout go up, whose notes are
those of joy.

*Enter Orestes and Pylades, with corpse of Aegisthus.*

El. Hail! Glorious victor, Orestes, son of a sire
who won the day ’neath Ilium’s walls, accept this
wreath to bind about the tresses of thy hair. Not in
vain hast thou run thy course unto the goal and
reached thy home again; no! But thou hast slain thy
foe, Aegisthus, the murderer of our father. Thou
too, O Pylades, trusty squire, whose training shows
thy father’s sterling worth, receive a garland from
my hand, for thou no less than he hast a share in
this emprise; and so I pray, good luck be thine for
ever!

Or. First recognize the gods, Electra, as being the
authors of our fortune, and then praise me their
minister and fate’s. Yea, I come from having slain
Aegisthus in very deed, no mere pretence; and to
make thee the more certain of this, I am bringing
thee his corpse, which, if thou wilt, expose for beasts
to rend, or set it upon a stake for birds, the children
of the air, to prey upon; for now is he thy slave,
once called thy lord and master.

El. I am ashamed to utter my wishes.

Or. What is it? Speak out, for thou art through
the gates of fear.

El. I am ashamed to flout the dead, for fear some
spite assail me.

Or. No one would blame thee for this.

El. Our folk are hard to please, and love scandal.

Or. Speak all thy mind, sister; for we entered on
this feud with him on terms admitting not of truce.

El. Enough! *(Turning to the corpse of Aegisthus)* With which of thy iniquities shall I begin my recital?
With which shall I end it? To which allot a
middle place? And yet I never ceased, as each day
dawned, to rehearse the story I would tell thee to
thy face, if ever I were freed from my old terrors;
and now I am; so I will pay thee back with the abuse
I fain had uttered to thee when alive. Thou wert
my ruin, making me and my brother orphans, though
we had never injured thee, and thou didst make
a shameful marriage with my mother, having slain
her lord who led the host of Hellas, though thyself
didst never go to Troy. Such was thy folly, thou
didst never dream that my mother would prove
thy curse when thou didst marry her, though thou
wert wronging my father’s honour. Know this; whoso
defiles his neighbour’s wife, and afterward is forced
to take her to himself, is a wretched wight, if he
supposes she will be chaste as his wife, though she
sinned against her former lord. Thine was a life
most miserable, though thou didst pretend 'twas
otherwise; well thou knewest how guilty thy marriage
was, and my mother knew she had a villain for
husband. Sinners both, ye took each other’s lot, she
thy fortune, thou her curse. While everywhere in
Argos thou wouldst hear such phrases as, “that woman’s
husband,” never, “that man’s wife.” Yet 'tis
shameful for the wife and not the man to rule the
house; wherefore I loathe those children, who are
called in the city not the sons of the man, their
father, but of their mother. For instance, if a man
makes a great match above his rank, there is no talk
of the husband but only of the wife. Herein lay thy
grievous error, due to ignorance; thou thoughtest
thyself someone, relying on thy wealth, but this is
naught save to stay with us a space. 'Tis nature that
stands fast, not wealth. For it, if it abide unchanged,
exalts man’s horn; but riches dishonestly acquired
and in the hands of fools, soon take their flight,
their blossom quickly shed. As for thy sins with
women, I pass them by, 'tis not for maiden’s lips to
mention them, but I will shrewdly hint thereat.
And then thy arrogance! Because forsooth thou hadst
a palace and some looks to boast. May I never have
a husband with a girl’s face, but one that bears him
like a man! For the children of these latter cling to
a life of arms, while those, who are so fair to see, do
only serve to grace the dance. Away from me!
*(Spurning the corpse with her foot)* Time has shown
thy villainy, little as thou reckest of the forfeit thou
hast paid for it. Let none suppose, though he have
run the first stage of his course with joy, that he
will get the better of Justice, till he have reached
the goal and ended his career.

Ch. Terrible alike his crime and your revenge; for
mighty is the power of justice.

Or. 'Tis well. Carry his body within the house
and hide it, sirrahs, that, when my mother comes,
she may not see his corpse before she is smitten herself.

El. Hold! Let us strike out another scheme.

Or. How now? Are those allies from Mycenae
whom I see?

El. No, 'tis my mother, that bare me.

Or. Full into the net she is rushing, oh, bravely!

El. See how proudly she rides in her chariot and
fine robes!

Or. What must we do to our mother? Slay
her?

El. What! Has pity seized thee at sight of her?

Or. O God! How can I slay her that bare and
suckled me?

El. Slay her as she slew thy father and mine.

Or. O Phoebus, how foolish was thy oracle—

El. Where Apollo errs, who shall be wise?

Or. In bidding me commit this crime—my
mother’s murder!

El. How canst thou be hurt by avenging thy
father?

Or. Though pure before, I now shall carry into
exile the stain of a mother’s blood.

El. Still, if thou avenge not thy father, thou wilt
fail in thy duty.

Or. And if I slay my mother, I must pay the
penalty to her.

El. And so must thou to him, if thou resign the
avenging of our father.

Or. Surely it was a fiend in the likeness of the god
that ordered this!

El. Seated on the holy tripod? I think not so.

Or. I cannot believe this oracle was meant.

El. Turn not coward! Cast not thy manliness away!

Or. Am I to devise the same crafty scheme for
her?

El. The self-same death thou didst mete out to
her lord Aegisthus.

Or. I will go in; 'tis an awful task I undertake; an
awful deed I have to do; still if it is Heaven’s will,
be it so; I loathe and yet I love the enterprise.

*Orestes withdraws into the house.*

*Enter Clytaemnestra.*

Ch. Hail! Queen of Argos, daughter of Tyndareus,
sister of those two noble sons of Zeus, who dwell in
the flame-lit firmament amid the stars, whose guerdon
high it is to save the sailor tossing on the sea.
All hail! Because of thy wealth and high prosperity,
I do thee homage as I do the blessed gods. Now is
the time, great queen, for us to pay our court unto
thy fortunes.

Clytaemnestra. Alight from the car, ye Trojan
maids, and take my hand that I may step down from
the
chariot. With Trojan spoils the temples of the
gods are decked, but I have obtained these maidens
as a special gift from Troy, in return for my lost
daughter, a trifling boon no doubt, but still an ornament
to my house.

El. And may not I, mother, take that highly-
favoured hand of thine? I am a slave like them, an
exile from my father’s halls in this miserable abode.

Cl. See, my servants are here; trouble not on my
account.

El. Why, thou didst make me thy prisoner by
robbing me of my home; like these I became a captive
when my home was taken, an orphan all forlorn.

Cl. True; but thy father plotted so wickedly
against those of his own kin whom least of all he
should have treated so. Speak I must; albeit, when
a woman gets an evil reputation, there is a feeling
of bitterness against all she says; unfairly indeed in
my case, for it were only fair to hate after learning
the circumstances, and seeing if the object deserves
it; otherwise, why hate at all? Now Tyndareus be—

# Electra

**Clytemnestra:**
He swore to my father
Not that I or any children I might bear
Should be slain. Yet he went and took
My daughter from our house to the fleet at Aulis,
Persuading me that Achilles was to wed her;
And there he held her o’er the pyre,
And cut Iphigenia’s snowy throat.
Had he slain her to save his city from capture,
Or to benefit his house, or to preserve his
Other children, a sacrifice of one for many,
I could have pardoned him. But, as it was,
His reasons for murdering my child were these:
The wantonness of Helen and her husband’s folly
In not punishing the traitress. Still, wronged as I was,
My rage had not burst forth for this,
Nor would I have slain my lord,
Had he not returned to me with that frenzied maiden
And made her his mistress, keeping at once
Two brides beneath the same roof.
Women maybe are given to folly, I do not deny it;
This granted, when a husband goes astray
And sets aside his own true wife,
She fain will follow his example
And find another love; and then in our case
Hot abuse is heard, while the men,
Who are to blame for this, escape without a word.
Again, suppose Menelaus had been secretly
Snatched from his home, should I have had
To kill Orestes to save Menelaus,
My sister’s husband? How would thy father
Have endured this? Was he then to escape death
For slaying what was mine, while I was to suffer
At his hands? I slew him, turning,
As my only course, to his enemies.
For which of all thy father’s friends
Would have joined me in his murder?
Speak all that is in thy heart,
And prove against me with all free speech,
That thy father’s death was not deserved.

**Electra:**
Justly urged! but thy justice is not free from shame;
For in all things should every woman of sense
Yield to her husband. Whoso thinketh otherwise
Comes not within the scope of what I say.
Remember, mother, those last words of thine,
Allowing me free utterance before thee.

**Clytemnestra:**
Daughter, far from refusing it, I grant it again.

**Electra:**
Thou wilt not, when thou hearest, wreak thy vengeance on me?

**Clytemnestra:**
No, indeed; I shall welcome thy opinion.

**Electra:**
Then will I speak, and this shall be the prelude of my speech:
Ah, mother mine! would thou hadst had a better heart;
For though thy beauty and Helen’s win you praises well deserved,
Yet are ye akin in nature, a pair of wantons,
Unworthy of Castor. She was carried off, ’tis true,
But her fall was voluntary; and thou hast slain
The bravest soul in Hellas, excusing thyself
On the ground that thou didst kill a husband
To avenge a daughter; the world does not know thee
So well as I do, thou who before ever
Thy daughter’s death was decided, yea, soon as thy lord
Had started from his home, wert combing
Thy golden tresses at thy mirror.
That wife who, when her lord is gone from home,
Sets to beautifying herself, strike off from virtue’s list;
For she has no need to carry her beauty abroad,
Save she is seeking some mischief.
Of all the wives in Hellas thou wert the only one I know
Who wert overjoyed when Troy’s star was in the ascendant,
While, if it set, thy brow was clouded,
Since thou hadst no wish that Agamemnon
Should return from Troy. And yet thou couldst have played
A virtuous part to thy own glory.
The husband thou hadst was no whit inferior to *Aegisthus*,
For he it was whom Hellas chose to be her captain.
And when thy sister Helen wrought that deed of shame,
Thou couldst have won thyself great glory,
For vice is a warning and calls attention to virtue.
If, as thou allegest, my father slew thy daughter,
What is the wrong I and my brother have done thee?
How was it thou didst not bestow on us
Our father’s halls after thy husband’s death,
Instead of bartering them to buy a paramour?
Again, thy husband is not exiled for thy son’s sake,
Nor is he slain to avenge my death,
Although by him this life is quenched
Twice as much as e’er my sister’s was;
So if murder is to succeed murder in requital,
I and thy son Orestes must slay thee
To avenge our father; if that was just, why so is this.
Whoso fixes his gaze on wealth or noble birth
And weds a wicked woman, is a fool;
Better is a humble partner in his home, if she be virtuous,
Than a proud one.

**Chorus:**
Chance rules the marriages of women;
Some I see turn out well, others ill,
Amongst mankind.

**Clytemnestra:**
Daughter, ’twas ever thy nature to love thy father.
This too one finds; some sons cling to their father,
Others have a deeper affection for their mother.
I will forgive thee, for myself am not so exceeding glad
At the deed that I have done, my child.
But thou—why thus unwashed and clad in foul attire,
Now that the days of thy lying-in are accomplished?
Ah me, for my sorry schemes!
I have goaded my husband into anger
More than e’er I should have done.

**Electra:**
Thy sorrow comes too late; the hour of remedy
Has gone from thee; my father is dead.
Yet why not recall that exile, thy own wandering son?

**Clytemnestra:**
I am afraid; ’tis my interest, not his that I regard.
For they say he is wroth for his father’s murder.

**Electra:**
Why, then, dost thou encourage thy husband’s bitterness against us?

**Clytemnestra:**
’Tis his way; thou too hast a stubborn nature.

**Electra:**
Because I am grieved; yet will I check my spirit.

**Clytemnestra:**
I promise then he shall no longer oppress thee.

**Electra:**
From living in my home he grows too proud.

**Clytemnestra:**
Now there! ’tis thou that art fanning the quarrel into new life.

**Electra:**
I say no more; my dread of him is even what it is.

**Clytemnestra:**
Peace! Enough of this. Why didst thou summon me, my child?

**Electra:**
Thou hast heard, I suppose, of my confinement;
For this I pray thee, since I know not how,
Offer the customary sacrifice on the tenth day after birth,
For I am a novice herein, never having had a child before.

**Clytemnestra:**
This is work for another, even for her who delivered thee.

**Electra:**
I was all alone in my travail and at the babe’s birth.

**Clytemnestra:**
Dost live so far from neighbours?

**Electra:**
No one cares to make the poor his friends.

**Clytemnestra:**
Well, I will go to offer to the gods a sacrifice
For the child’s completion of the days;
And when I have done thee this service,
I will seek the field where my husband is sacrificing to the Nymphs.
Take this chariot hence, my servants, and tie the horses to the stalls;
And when ye think that I have finished my offering to the gods,
Attend me, for I must likewise pleasure my lord.

*Going into the house.*

**Electra:**
Enter our humble cottage; but, prithee, take care
That my smoke-grimed walls soil not thy robes;
Now wilt thou offer to the gods a fitting sacrifice.
There stands the basket ready, and the knife is sharpened,
The same that slew the bull, by whose side
Thou soon wilt lie a corpse; and thou shalt be his bride
In Hades’ halls whose wife thou wast on earth.
This is the boon I will grant thee,
While thou shalt pay me for my father’s blood.

*Exit Electra.*

**Chorus:**
Misery is changing sides; the breeze veers round,
And now blows fair upon my house.
The day is past when my chief fell murdered in his bath,
And the roof and the very stones of the walls rang with his cry:
“O cruel wife, why art thou murdering me
On my return to my dear country after ten long years?”

The tide is turning, and justice that pursues the faithless wife
Is drawing within its grasp the murderess,
Who slew her hapless lord, when he came home at last
To these towering Cyclopean walls—
Aye, with her own hand she smote him with the sharpened steel,
Herself the axe uplifting. Unhappy husband!
Whate’er the curse that possessed that wretched woman.
Like a lioness of the hills that rangeth
Through the woodland for her prey, she wrought the deed.

**Clytemnestra:** *(Within)*
O my children, by Heaven I pray ye spare your mother!

**Chorus:**
Dost hear her cries within the house?

**Clytemnestra:**
O God! ah me!

**Chorus:**
I too bewail thee, dying by thy children’s hands.
God deals out His justice in His good time.
A cruel fate is thine, unhappy one;
Yet didst thou sin in murdering thy lord.

But lo! from the house they come,
Dabbled in their mother’s fresh-spilt gore,
Their triumph proving the piteous butchery.
There is not nor has ever been a race
More wretched than the line of Tantalus.

*The two corpses are shown.*
*Enter Orestes and Electra.*

**Orestes:**
O Earth, and Zeus whose eye is over all!
Behold this foul deed of blood, these two corpses lying here
That I have slain in vengeance for my sufferings.
[1]

**Electra:**
Tears are all too weak for this, brother;
And I am the guilty cause. Ah, woe is me!
How hot my fury burned against the mother that bare me!

**Orestes:**
Alas! for thy lot, O mother mine!
A piteous, piteous doom, aye, worse than that,
Hast thou incurred at children’s hands!
Yet justly hast thou paid forfeit for our father’s blood.
Ah, Phoebus! thine was the voice that praised this vengeance;
Thou it is that hast brought these hideous scenes to light,
And caused this deed of blood. To what city can I go henceforth?
What friend, what man of any piety will bear the sight
Of a mother’s murderer like me?

**Electra:**
Ah me! alas! and whither can I go?
What share have I henceforth in dance or marriage rite?
What husband will accept me as his bride?

**Orestes:**
Again thy fancy changes with the wind;
For now thou thinkest aright, though not so formerly;
An awful deed didst thou urge thy brother
Against his will to commit, dear sister.
Oh! didst thou see how the poor victim
Threw open her robe and showed her bosom as I smote her,
Sinking on her knees, poor wretch? My heart melted within me.

**Electra:**
Full well I know the agony through which thou didst pass
At hearing thy own mother’s bitter cry.

**Orestes:**
Ah yes! she laid her hand upon my chin,
And cried aloud, “My child, I entreat thee!”
And she clung about my neck, so that I let fall the sword.

**Electra:**
O my poor mother! How didst thou endure
To see her breathe her last before thy eyes?

**Orestes:**
I threw my mantle o’er them and began the sacrifice
By plunging the sword into my mother’s throat.

**Electra:**
Yet ’twas I that urged thee on, yea,
And likewise grasped the steel. Oh! I have done an awful deed.

**Orestes:**
Oh! take and hide our mother’s corpse beneath a pall,
And close her gaping wound. *(Turning to the corpse)*
Ah! thy murderers were thine own children.

**Electra:** *(Covering the corpse)*
There! thou corpse both loved and loathed;
Still o’er thee I cast a robe, to end
The grievous troubles of our house.

*(The Dioscuri are seen hovering above the house)*

**Chorus:**
See! where o’er the roof-top spirits are appearing,
Or gods maybe from heaven, for this is not
A road that mortals tread. Why come they thus
Where mortal eyes can see them clearly?

**The Dioscuri:**
Hearken, son of Agamemnon. We, the twin sons of Zeus,
Thy mother’s brothers, call thee, even Castor and his brother Polydeuces.
’Tis but now we have reached Argos after stilling the fury of the sea for mariners,
Having seen the slaying of our sister, thy mother.
She hath received her just reward, but thine is no righteous act,
And Phoebus — but no! he is my king, my lips are sealed —
Is Phoebus still, albeit the oracle he gave thee
Was no great proof of his wisdom. But we must acquiesce herein.
Henceforth must thou follow what Zeus and destiny ordain for thee.
On Pylades bestow Electra for his wife to take unto his home;
Do thou leave Argos, for after thy mother’s murder
Thou mayst not set foot in the city.
And those grim goddesses of doom, that glare like savage hounds,
Will drive thee mad and chase thee to and fro;
But go thou to Athens and make thy prayer to the holy image of Pallas,
For she will close their fierce serpents’ mouths, so that they touch thee not,
Holding o’er thy head her *aegis* with the Gorgon’s head.
A hill there is, to Ares sacred, where first the gods in conclave sat
To decide the law of blood, in the day that savage Ares slew *Halirrhothius*,
Son of the ocean-king, in anger for the violence he offered to his daughter’s honour;
From that time all decisions given there are most holy and have heaven’s sanction.
There must thou have this murder tried; and if equal votes are given,
They shall save thee from death in the decision,
For Loxias will take the blame upon himself,
Since it was his oracle that advised thy mother’s murder.
And this shall be the law for all posterity;
In every trial the accused shall win his case if the votes are equal.
Then shall those dread goddesses, stricken with grief at this,
Vanish into a cleft of the earth close to the hill,
Revered by men thenceforth as a place for holy oracles;
Whilst thou must settle in a city of Arcadia on the banks of the river Alpheus
Near the shrine of Lycaean Apollo, and the city shall be called after thy name.
To thee I say this. As for the corpse of *Aegisthus*,
The citizens of Argos must give it burial;
But Menelaus, who has just arrived at Nauplia from the sack of Troy,
Shall bury thy mother, Helen helping him;
For she hath come from her sojourn in Egypt in the halls of Proteus,
And hath never been to Troy; but Zeus, to stir up strife and bloodshed in the world,
Sent forth a phantom of Helen to Ilium.
Now let Pylades take his maiden wife and bear her to his home in Achaea;
Also he must conduct thy so-called kinsman to the land of Phocis,
And there reward him well. But go thyself along the narrow Isthmus,
And seek Cecropia’s happy home.
For once thou hast fulfilled the doom appointed for this murder,
Thou shalt be blest and free from all thy troubles.

**Chorus:**
Ye sons of Zeus, may we draw near to speak with you?

**Dioscuri:**
Ye may, since ye are not polluted by this murder.

**Orestes:**
May I too share your converse, sons of Tyndareus?

**Dioscuri:**
Thou too; for to Phoebus will I ascribe this deed of blood.

**Chorus:**
How was it that ye, the brothers of the murdered woman,
Gods too, did not ward the doom-goddesses from her roof?

**Dioscuri:**
’Twas fate that brought resistless doom to her,
And that thoughtless oracle that Phoebus gave.

**Electra:**
But why did the god, and wherefore did his oracles
Make me my mother’s murderer?

**Dioscuri:**
A share in the deed, a share in its doom;
One ancestral curse hath ruined both of you.

**Orestes:**
Ah, sister mine! at last I see thee again
Only to be robbed in a moment of thy dear love;
I must leave thee, and by thee be left.

**Dioscuri:**
Hers are a husband and a home; her only suffering this,
That she is quitting Argos.

**Orestes:**
Yet what could call forth deeper grief
Than exile from one’s fatherland?
I must leave my father’s house,
And at a stranger’s bar be sentenced for my mother’s blood.

**Dioscuri:**
Be of good cheer; go to the holy town of Pallas;
Keep a stout heart only.

**Electra:**
O my brother, best and dearest! clasp me to thy breast;
For now is the curse of our mother’s blood
Cutting us off from the home of our fathers.

**Orestes:**
Throw thy arms in close embrace about me.
Oh! weep as o’er my grave when I am dead.

**Dioscuri:**
Ah me! that bitter cry makes even gods shudder to hear.
Yea, for in my breast and in every heavenly being’s
Dwells pity for the sorrows of mankind.

**Orestes:**
Never to see thee more!

**Electra:**
Never again to stand within thy sight!

**Orestes:**
This is my last good-bye to thee.

**Electra:**
Farewell, farewell, my city! and ye my fellow-countrywomen,
A long farewell to you!

**Orestes:**
Art thou going already, truest of thy sex?

**Electra:**
I go, the teardrop dimming my young eye.

**Orestes:**
Go, Pylades, and be happy; take and wed Electra.

**Dioscuri:**
Their only thoughts will be their marriage;
But haste thee to Athens, seeking to escape these hounds of hell,
For they are on thy track in fearful wise,
Swart monsters, with snakes for hands, who reap a harvest of man’s agony.
But we twain must haste away o’er the Sicilian main
To save the seaman’s ship.
Yet as we fly through heaven’s expanse we help not the wicked;
But whoso in his life loves piety and justice,
All such we free from troublous toils and save.
Wherefore let no man be minded to act unjustly,
Or with men foresworn set sail;
Such the warning I, a god, to mortals give.

**Chorus:**
Farewell! truly that mortal’s is a happy lot,
Who can thus fare, unafflicted by any calamity.

*Exeunt omnes.*
