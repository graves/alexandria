*On the sea-shore, in the Tauric Chersonese, near a temple of Artemis. Enter Iphigenia.*

Iphigenia.
> Pelops, the son of Tantalus, came to Pisa
> With swift steeds and won his bride, the daughter
> Of *Oenomaus*, who bare Atreus to him;
> Atreus had issue Menelaus and Agamemnon;
> And I am Agamemnon’s child, Iphigenia,
> By the daughter of Tyndareus, the maid
> Whom ’tis thought my father offered to Artemis
> For the sake of Helen in the famous bay of Aulis,
> Hard by the eddies which Euripus turneth
> Ever to and fro before the changing breeze,
> As he rolls along his deep dark wave;
> For there it was that king Agamemnon
> Gathered a fleet of a thousand ships from Hellas,
> Wishing his Achaeans to win the fair crown
> Of victory over Ilium and avenge
> The outrage offered to Helen’s marriage-vow,
> All for the sake of Menelaus.
> But when, owing to foul weather,
> He could not get a favouring wind,
> He had recourse to the diviner’s flame,
> And this was what Calchas told him:
> “O Agamemnon, captain of this host of Hellas,
> No chance hast thou of unmooring thy ships,
> Till Artemis has received thy daughter Iphigenia
> In sacrifice; for thou didst vow to offer
> To the goddess of light the fairest thing
> The year produced. Now thy wife Clytaemnestra
> Has given birth to a daughter in thy house,
> Whom thou must sacrifice,” ascribing to me
> The title of “fairest”; and by the arts of Odysseus
> They took me from my mother’s side,
> On the pretext of wedding me to Achilles;
> But, when I reached Aulis, I was seized,
> Poor maid, and lifted high above the pyre;
> I saw the sword in act to strike,
> When Artemis stole me out of the Achaeans’ hands,
> Leaving a hind in my place; and she carried me
> Through the radiant air and set me to dwell here
> In the land of the Tauri, where a barbarian
> Is king over barbarians, e’en Thoas,
> Whose name is due to his fleetness,
> For swift as a bird on the wing he speeds his course.
> He made me priestess in the temple here;
> And this is why, in accordance with the observances
> Of a festival in which the goddess Artemis delights,
> A festival fair only in name—but I say no more
> From fear of that deity; for I sacrifice
> Each son of Hellas who touches at these shores,
> This being the custom in the city even before I came;
> I begin the rite, but the awful act of slaughter
> Belongs to others inside the shrine of the goddess.

> Strange visions the past night brought me,
> Which I will tell to the air, if there is really
> Any help in that. As I slept, methought
> I had escaped this land and was once more in Argos,
> Sleeping in the midst of my maidens, when lo!
> The surface of the ground was shaken by an earthquake;
> Whereat I fled, and, standing outside the house,
> I saw its coping falling and the whole building
> Dashed in ruin from roof to base.
> Only one column, methought, of my father’s halls
> Was left standing, and from its capital it let stream
> The auburn hair and took a human tongue;
> And I, observant of the murderous craft
> I practise against strangers, began sprinkling it,
> As it had been a victim, weeping the while.

> Now this is my interpretation of the dream:
> Orestes is dead; ’twas for him I began the rites;
> For sons are the pillars of a house,
> And death is the lot of all whom once
> My lustral waters sprinkle. Again,
> I cannot fix the dream upon my friends,
> For Strophius had no son at the time I was called to die.
> Now therefore I mean to pour a drink-offering
> To my brother who is far from me here,
> For this I can do, with the help of the maidens
> From Hellas whom the king has given me as attendants.
> But wherefore are they not yet here?
> I will enter the courts of the goddess’s temple,
> Where I dwell.

*Exit Iphigenia.*

*Enter Orestes and Pylades.*

Orestes. ( *Entering cautiously* )
> Take care and see whether there is any one in the road.

Pylades.
> I am doing so, keeping a careful look-out in every direction.

Orestes.
> Thinkest thou, Pylades, this is the abode of the goddess
> Towards which we steered our sea-borne barque from Argos?

Pylades.
> I think it is, Orestes; and thou must share my opinion.

Orestes.
> And is that the altar, o’er which the blood of Hellenes trickles?

Pylades.
> Its edges at any rate are discoloured with blood-stains.

Orestes.
> Dost see a string of spoils just beneath the coping?

Pylades.
> Aye, trophies of strangers who have been murdered.

Orestes.
> Well, we must cast our eyes all round and keep a good look-out.

> Ah, Phoebus! why have thy oracles brought me
> Once more into this strait, after I had avenged
> The blood of my sire by slaying my mother?
> An exile from hearth and home, I was persecuted
> By relays of avenging fiends, completing
> Many a lengthy course. So I went and questioned thee
> How to find an end to the whirling madness
> And distress I was enduring in ranging up and down
> Through Hellas; and thy answer was that I should seek
> The confines of the Taurian land, where Artemis
> Thy sister has her altars, and take from thence
> An image of the goddess, which fell from heaven,
> So men say, into her temple there;
> Then when I had secured it by craft or luck maybe,
> When every risk was run, I was to present it
> To the land of Athens. Beyond this naught was said;
> That done, I was to have relief from trouble.
> So in obedience to thy bidding I have come
> Hither to a strange and cheerless shore.

> Now, Pylades, as my partner in this hard emprise,
> I ask thee, what are we to do?
> For thou seest the height of these encircling walls.
> Shall we mount the steps leading to the building?
> How then escape detection? Or can we force
> The brazen bolts with levers, when we know nothing
> About them? If we are caught trying to open the doors
> Or plotting an entrance, we shall be slain;
> Ere that let us escape upon our ship,
> Wherein we sailed hither.

Pylades.
> Flight is intolerable; we are not used to it;
> And the god’s oracle must not be slighted;
> But let us quit the temple and hide ourselves
> In some cavern, washed by the sea’s black tide,
> Apart from our ship, lest some one see it
> And tell the rulers, and we be then seized by force.
> But when the eye of darksome night appears,
> We must e’en dare to take the polished image
> From the shrine, bringing all our craft to bear on it.
> Look there between the rafters, where an empty space
> Is left by which to lower oneself.
> ’Tis well; the brave can face hardship,
> But cowards are never of any account.
> What! shall we, after toiling at the oar
> So long and far, turn back again and leave the goal?

Orestes.
> Well said! obedience is my cue.
> We must find some spot where we can both hide ourselves
> Out of sight; for assuredly the god will not be the cause
> Of his own oracle falling fruitless to the ground;
> Courage is all that is required, for the young
> Have no excuse for shirking toil.

*Exeunt Orestes and Pylades.*

*Enter Iphigenia and Chorus.*

Chorus.
> Hush! a solemn silence! ye dwellers
> On the double clashing rocks that guard the Euxine sea!
> All hail, Latona’s child, Dictynna, goddess of the hills!
> To thy court I guide my steps in maiden saintliness,
> To thy gilded dome with beauteous colonnades,
> To wait on her that keeps thy keys in holy trust,
> Bidding farewell for this to the embattled walls of Hellas,
> The land of horses, to Eurotas with its meadows
> ’Mid the trees, where stood my father’s house.

> I am here; what news? why so thoughtful?
> Wherefore hast thou summoned me to the temple?
> O daughter of him who sought the towers of Troy
> With the famous fleet of a thousand ships
> And their crews of countless warriors,
> Gathered by the noble sons of Atreus!

Iphigenia.
> My handmaids, ye find me busied
> With most woeful dirges, dismal strains
> Ne’er uttered by the Muse, as I mourn
> A kinsman dead, ah me! for this is the trouble
> That has befallen me; I am weeping for my brother
> Reft of life, so sure the vision I beheld
> In the darkness of the night just past.

> Undone! undone! Ah me! my father’s house
> Is now no more; our race is dead and gone.
> Woe! woe for the troubles in Argos!
> Out on thee, destiny! that robbest me
> Of my only brother, sending him to Hades;
> For him I am about to pour this offering
> On the lap of earth, a cup for the departed dead—
> Milk of mountain-roving kine, a draught
> Of Bacchus’ own drink, and what the russet bees
> Have garnered by their toil—the soothing gift
> Which custom gives the dead.

( *To a servant* )
> Hand me the solid urn of gold, the death-god’s drink-offering.

> Scion of Agamemnon’s line beneath the earth!
> To thee as dead I send these gifts; accept them thus,
> For I shall never bring thee at thy tomb
> My golden locks or tears; for very far
> I dwell from the land of our fathers,
> Where men thought this luckless maiden died
> Beneath the knife.

Chorus.
> Lady, to thee will I now pour out
> An answering strain, an eastern dirge
> That wails in foreign key, a litany of woe,
> Chanted o’er the dead in mourning,
> A song of Hades’ singing, wherein the *paean*
> Plays no part.

> Woe for the royal house of the *Atridae*!
> Its light is quenched. Woe for their ancestral home!
> Who of all the prosperous kings in Argos
> Shall rule o’er it? Trouble born of trouble
> Darteth on it; and the sun-god with winged
> Careering steeds turned from his place
> And changed his light divine. Woe on woe,
> And death on death, with anguish unto anguish added,
> Has come upon this house, all for a golden lamb;
> From this source vengeance made its way
> Into the family for those who were slain before
> Of the race of Tantalus; while against thee
> Fate is eager in the pursuit of mischief.

Iphigenia.
> Bitter to me from the very first
> The fate of my mother’s marriage;
> From the first on that night I was conceived,
> The goddesses, who rule men’s destiny,
> Strove to make my childhood hard.
> I was the first fair babe she bore
> In her marriage-bower, that hapless daughter
> Of Leda whom all Hellas wooed,
> Born and reared by her to be the victim
> Of my father’s despite, a joyless offering,
> When, to pay his vow, they brought me
> In a chariot drawn by steeds and set me
> On the strand of Aulis to be the bride—
> Ah! bride of sorrow—to the *Nereid’s* son.
> But now beside the ruthless sea
> I make my cheerless home, an alien,
> Torn from home and friends, with none
> To call me wife or mother; never singing
> Hera’s praise, my queen in Argos,
> Nor ’mid the merry whirr of looms
> Broidering with the shuttle a picture
> Of Athenian Pallas and the Titans,
> But staining altars instead with the streaming blood
> Of doomed strangers, whose moans and tears are piteous,
> No theme for minstrel’s lyre.
> Of them I am not thinking now,
> But I weep for my brother, dead in Argos,
> Even for Orestes the heir to the Argive throne,
> Whom I left a babe unweaned, an infant
> In his mother’s arms, still hanging at her breast.

Chorus.
> Behold, a herdsman is come from the beach
> To bring thee tidings.

*Enter Herdsman.*

Herdsman.
> Daughter of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra,
> Hearken to the news I have to tell.

Iphigenia.
> Why, what is here to interrupt our present conversation?

Herdsman.
> Two youths, escaping on a ship, have reached
> The misty coast of the Symplegades,
> A grateful sacrifice for thee to offer
> To the goddess Artemis. Haste then to make
> All ready, the lustral water and the opening rites.

Iphigenia.
> Whence come they? what is the name of these strangers’ country?

Herdsman.
> They are from Hellas; that is all I know, nothing further.

Iphigenia.
> Didst thou not even catch the strangers’ names,
> So that thou canst tell me?

Herdsman.
> Pylades one called the other.

Iphigenia.
> And the stranger’s comrade, what was his name?

Herdsman.
> That no one knows; for we never heard it.

Iphigenia.
> Where were ye, when ye saw and captured them?

Herdsman.
> Upon the extreme edge of the cheerless sea.

Iphigenia.
> Pray, what were herdsmen doing by the sea?

Herdsman.
> We had gone to wash our cattle in its briny spray.

Iphigenia.
> Return to that other point; where did ye take them, and how?
> For this is what I wish to know.
> ’Tis long since strangers came, and our goddess’ altar
> Has not been crimsoned all that while
> With streams of Hellene blood.

Herdsman.
> We were just driving our cattle from their woodland pastures
> To yonder sea which flows between “the Clashing Rocks,”
> Where is a certain hollow cleft, scooped by the rush of the tide,
> A shelter used by purple-fishers, when a herdsman
> Of our company saw two young men, and,
> Coming back to us on tiptoe, he said,
> “Do ye not see them? there are deities seated yonder.”
> Then one of us, a god-fearing man, lifted up his hands
> And, looking towards them, prayed thus:
> “Lord *Palaemon*, son of the nymph Leucothea,
> In whose keeping are all ships, have mercy on us!
> Whether ye twain now seated on the beach
> Are ‘the Twin Brethren’ or darlings of father Nereus,
> Who begot that lovely choir of fifty Nereids.”

> But another, with a reckless disregard of what is right,
> Scoffed at his prayers, and would have it that they were
> Shipwrecked mariners sheltering in the gully
> For fear of our custom, having heard how we sacrifice
> Strangers in this land.

> Now most of us, thinking he was right,
> Determined to hunt them for the goddess,
> Victims such as our country offers.
> Meantime one of the two strangers, leaving the rocky cave,
> Suddenly stood still and fell to shaking his head
> Wildly up and down and groaning loudly,
> Trembling to his very fingertips in a frenzied fit,
> And shouting like a hunter, “There! Pylades,
> Dost see her? there! dost see her now, the hellish snake,
> How eager she is for my blood, with her fearsome vipers
> All agape to bite me? and yet a third,
> Who belches fire and death, wings her way
> To a rocky height with my mother in her arms,
> To hurl her thence upon me. Oh, horror!
> She will kill me; where am I to fly?”

> We could not see these weird shapes,
> But he mistook the lowing of cows and the barking of dogs
> For the sounds which he said the fiends were uttering
> In imitation of them. Now we were sitting
> Huddled together in silence, as doomed men,
> When lo! he drew his sword, and, rushing like a lion
> Into the midst of the heifers, fell to slashing
> At their flanks and plunging his sword in their sides,
> Thinking he was thus warding off the vengeful goddesses,
> So that the surface of the sea broke out in clots of gore.
> We meantime, seeing our cattle harried and slain,
> Began to arm us, one and all, blowing the while
> On curved shells and calling the people of the place together,
> And very soon we were gathered in full force;
> But then the stranger left his sudden fit,
> And, foaming at the mouth, he falls;
> We, seeing him fallen so opportunely, set-to,
> Each man of us, to hurl and smite at him,
> But the other of that pair wiped the foam from his lips
> And was careful of his body, holding out his finely-woven robe
> To cover him, watching anxiously for threatened wounds
> And ministering to his friend most tenderly.
> Suddenly the madman recovering his senses
> Sprang up from where he fell and was ware
> Of the surging press of foes and of the nearness
> Of that calamity which is upon them now,
> And he gave one groan, but we the while
> Ne’er ceased pelting them from every side
> With right good will; whereon we heard this fearful order given,
> “Pylades, we have to die; see that it be with honour;
> Draw thy sword and follow me.”

> But when we saw the brandished blades
> Of our two enemies, we took to flight
> And were filling the rocky glens;
> Still, if one or two did fly, the rest kept up
> A vigorous fire at them, and if perchance
> They drove these off, the party, which was giving way at first,
> Set-to stoning them again. This sounds incredible,
> But not a man of all the crowd that threw
> Succeeded in hitting the goddess’s victims.
> At last however we mastered them—not by bravery,
> ’Tis true—but, surrounding them completely,
> We contrived to knock the swords from their hands with stones,
> And they sank to the ground through fatigue;
> At once we bring them to our monarch,
> Who no sooner sees them than he despatches them
> To thee to purify and sacrifice.
> Be thy prayer, maiden, that such strangers
> May be forthcoming for thy offering;
> Go on slaying men like these, and Hellas
> Will make atonement for thy own blood,
> Expiating that sacrifice in Aulis.

Chorus.
> A strange story thou tellest about this waif,
> Whoever he is, that is come from the land of Hellas
> To the cheerless sea.

Iphigenia.
> Enough! go, bring the strangers hither;
> While I will see to what is needed here.

*Exit Herdsman.*

> Alas, my suffering heart! in days gone by
> Thou wert always kind and compassionate towards strangers,
> Paying their kindred race the tribute of a tear,
> Whenever thou hadst Hellenes in thy power;
> But now, by reason of dreams which have made me cruel
> From thinking that Orestes is no longer alive,
> Ye will find my heart hardened, whoe’er ye are
> That have arrived. So then this also is a true saying, friends,
> And I experience it; “The unfortunate,
> Having once known prosperity themselves,
> Bear no kind feelings towards their luckier neighbours.”

> No breeze from Zeus hath ever blown,
> Nor vessel sailed, which might have carried Helen hither
> From her course between “the clashing rocks”—
> Helen, my bane, and Menelaus with her—
> That so I might have taken vengeance on them,
> Putting Aulis here to balance Aulis there,
> Where Danaid chiefs with brutal violence
> Were for slaughtering me like a heifer,
> My own father being the priest.

> Oh! I can never forget that hideous scene,
> The many times I strained my hands to touch his beard,
> And how I clung to my father’s knees and cried,
> “’Tis to a sorry wedding I am brought by thee, my sire;
> E’en now while thou art slaying me, my mother
> And the Argive maids are singing my marriage-hymn,
> And our house is filled with music; but I am dying
> All the time, slain by thee. Hades, it seems,
> And not the son of Peleus was the Achilles
> Thou didst offer me as lord, having brought me
> In thy chariot to a bloody wedding by a trick.”
> A fine-spun veil was o’er my eyes,
> So I never took my brother in my arms—
> That brother now no more—nor kissed my sister
> On the lips from modesty, as if it were
> For Peleus’ halls that I was bound;
> But many a fond caress I kept in store for the future,
> Believing I should yet return to Argos.

> Ah! Orestes, woe is thee! if thou art dead;
> From what a glorious lot and envied heritage
> Art thou cut off! I blame these subtle quibbles
> Of our goddess; say a man has spilt another’s blood
> Or even come in contact with a labouring woman
> Or a corpse, she bars him from her altars,
> Counting him unclean, and yet herself
> Delights in human sacrifice. It cannot be
> That Leto, bride of Zeus, ever bore so senseless a daughter.
> No! for my part I put no credit in that banquet
> Served by Tantalus to the gods, to believe
> That they felt pleasure in devouring a child;
> Rather I suspect that the natives of this land,
> Being cannibals themselves, impute this failing
> To their deity; for I cannot believe that any god
> Is such a sinner.

*Exit.*

Chorus.
> Ye dim dark rocks where meet the seas,
> O’er whose forbidding billows Io crossed,
> Driven from Argos by the winged gad-fly,
> Passing from Europe to the strand of Asia!
> Who can these be that left the fair waters
> Of Eurotas, with green beds of reeds,
> Or Dirce’s holy streams, to tread this savage soil,
> Where the daughter of Zeus bedews her altars
> And columned fanes with blood of men?
> Can they have sped a chariot of the deep
> Across the waves with oars of pine,
> Dashed in on either side, before the breeze
> That fills the sail, heaping up riches
> For their homes in eager rivalry?
> For hope, fond hope, appears to man’s undoing,
> Insatiate in the hearts of those who carry home
> A load of wealth, wanderers they across the main,
> Visitors to foreign towns in idle expectation.
> Some there are whose thoughts of wealth are not timed right,
> And some who find it come to them.

> How did they pass those clashing rocks
> Or the restless beach of Phineus,
> Racing along the sea-beat strand
> O’er the breakers of Ocean’s queen,
> Before the breeze that filled their sails,
> To the land where choirs of fifty *Nereid* maids
> Circle in the dance and sing—
> The rudder steady at the stern
> And whistling to the breath of south-west wind or zephyr,
> On to that gleaming strand, where fowls in plenty roost,
> To the fair race-course of Achilles along the cheerless sea?

> Oh! that chance would bring Helen,
> The darling child of Leda, hither on her way
> From Troy-town, as my lady prayed,
> That she might have the fatal water
> Sprinkled round her hair and die
> By my mistress’ knife, paying to her
> A proper recompense!

What joy to hear the welcome news that some
    mariner from Hellas had landed here, to end the
    sufferings of my bitter bondage! Oh! to set foot, if
    only in a dream, in my father’s home and city, a
    luxury sweet sleep affords, a pleasure shared by us
    with wealth!

*Enter Orestes and Pylades, guarded.*

    But see where the prisoners twain approach, their
    hands fast bound with chains, new victims for our
    goddess. Silence now, my friends! for those choice
    offerings from Hellas are now close to the temple,
    and it was no false news the herdsman announced.

    Thou awful queen! if by such acts this city wins
    thy favour, accept its sacrifice, not sanctioned by
    Hellenes, though openly offered by our custom.

*Enter Iphigenia.*

**Iphigenia:** Ah, well! my first thought must be the due
    performance of the goddess’s service.

    Loose the hands of the strangers; they are now
    devoted and must not be chained; then enter the
    temple and make ready, whatever present need requires
    or custom ordains. *(Exit guards.)*

*(Turning to the prisoners)* Ah! who was the mother
    that bare you? your father, who was he? or your
    sister, if haply ye had one? of what a gallant pair of
    brothers will she be bereft! Who knows on whom
    such strokes of fate will fall? for all that Heaven
    decrees, proceeds unseen, and no man knoweth of
    the ills in store; for Fate misleads us into doubtful
    paths.

    Whence come ye, hapless strangers? for long as
    ye have been in sailing hither, so shall ye be long
    absent from your homes, aye for ever in that world
    below.

**Orestes:** Woman, whoe’er thou art, why weep’st thou
    thus, or why distress us at the thought of our impending
    doom? No wise man I count him, who,
    when death looms near, attempts to quell its terrors
    by piteous laments, nor yet the man who bewails
    the Death-god’s arrival, when he has no hope of
    rescue; for he makes two evils out of one; he lets
    himself be called a fool and all the same he dies; he
    should let his fortune be. Weep not thou for us, for
    well we know what rites are offered here.

**Iphigenia:** Which of you bears the name of Pylades, as
    they called it here? This is what I wish to learn first.

**Orestes:** This is he, if the knowledge really gives thee
    any pleasure.

**Iphigenia:** What state in Hellas calls him son?

**Orestes:** What canst thou gain by learning this, lady?

**Iphigenia:** Are ye brothers, the sons of one mother?

**Orestes:** Brothers in friendship, not in blood.

**Iphigenia:** What name did the author of thy being give
    thee?

**Orestes:** I might with justice be called “Misfortune.”

**Iphigenia:** That is not what I ask; refer that to chance.

**Orestes:** If I die nameless, I shall not be mocked.

**Iphigenia:** Why grudge me this? Art so exceeding proud?

**Orestes:** ’Tis my body, not my name, that thou wilt
    sacrifice.

**Iphigenia:** Wilt thou not even tell me the name of thy
    city?

**Orestes:** No, for thy inquiry boots me not, seeing I am
    doomed to die.

**Iphigenia:** What hinders thee from granting me this boon?

**Orestes:** Glorious Argos is my home; I own it with
    pride.

**Iphigenia:** What! Argos? wert thou really born there, sir
    stranger?

**Orestes:** Aye, in Mycenae, so prosperous of yore.

**Iphigenia:** Was it as an exile or from what mischance that
    thou didst quit thy country?

**Orestes:** An exile I am in a certain sense, not of my own
    free will, nor yet against it.

**Iphigenia:** And yet thy coming from Argos was welcome
    to me.

**Orestes:** Not so to myself, but if thou art pleased, see
    to that thyself.

**Iphigenia:** Wilt tell me something that I wish to learn
    myself?

**Orestes:** To serve as an appendix to my misery!

**Iphigenia:** Maybe thou hast some knowledge of Troy,
    which is spoken of everywhere.

**Orestes:** Would God I knew it not so much as in a
    dream!

**Iphigenia:** They say that it is now no more, a city sacked.

**Orestes:** Why, so it is; ye heard aright.

**Iphigenia:** Did Helen return to the house of Menelaus?

**Orestes:** Aye, that she did, to the sorrow of one I loved.

**Iphigenia:** Where is she now? I too owe her a grudge.

**Orestes:** She is living in Sparta with her first husband.

**Iphigenia:** O creature hateful in the eyes of Hellenes, not
    in mine alone!

**Orestes:** I too have reaped some fruit of that woman’s
    marriages.

**Iphigenia:** Did the Achaeans make good their return, as
    ’tis rumoured?

**Orestes:** Thy question embraces everything at once.

**Iphigenia:** I would fain get an answer to it before thy
    death.

**Orestes:** Put thy questions, since thou art bent on it;
    I will answer.

**Iphigenia:** There was a seer Calchas—did he return from
    Troy?

**Orestes:** He was reported dead in Mycenae.

**Iphigenia:** Great queen! how well deserved! What of Laertes’
    son?

**Orestes:** He has not yet returned, but ’tis said he is
    still alive.

**Iphigenia:** Perdition seize him! ne’er may he reach home
    again!

**Orestes:** Spare thy curses; dire affliction is his lot.

**Iphigenia:** Is the son of Thetis the Nereid still living?

**Orestes:** No, dead; his marriage at Aulis came to naught.

**Iphigenia:** Aye, ’twas all a trick; at least they, who suffered
    by it, say so.

**Orestes:** Why, who art thou? thy questions touching
    Hellas are so apt.

**Iphigenia:** I am from Hellas; but, when a child, I lost
    that home.

**Orestes:** Then art thou right, lady, to long for news
    of it.

**Iphigenia:** What of that general, whom men style “the
    blest”?

**Orestes:** Who is that? The man of whom I wot is not
    among the blest.

**Iphigenia:** A prince called Agamemnon, said to be the
    son of Atreus.

**Orestes:** I knew him not; leave this theme, lady.

**Iphigenia:** I do entreat thee, no! but speak, fair sir, to
    gladden me.

**Orestes:** He is dead, poor king! and has caused another’s
    death as well.

**Iphigenia:** Dead? why, what befell him? woe is me!

**Orestes:** Why that heavy sigh? Was he related to thee?

**Iphigenia:** ’Tis for his former prosperity I grieve.

**Orestes:** And rightly too, for he came to a fearful end
    at a woman’s hands.

**Iphigenia:** O the piteous fate of that murderess and her
    victim!

**Orestes:** Prithee, cease and ask no more.

**Iphigenia:** Only this; is the wretched victim’s wife alive?

**Orestes:** No, dead; her son—the child she bore—he
    slew her.

**Iphigenia:** O house sore troubled! What could be his object?

**Orestes:** Vengeance on her for his father’s death.

**Iphigenia:** Alas for him! how well he exacted his evil
    justice.

**Orestes:** Spite of his justice, he has no luck at Heaven’s
    hand.

**Iphigenia:** Did Agamemnon leave any other issue in his
    halls?

**Orestes:** Yes, one maiden child, Electra.

**Iphigenia:** What! is no mention made of a daughter who
    was sacrificed?

**Orestes:** No, none, except that she has closed her eyes
    upon the light.

**Iphigenia:** Ah, woe is her and him that slew her, her own
    sire!

**Orestes:** In a thankless cause she died—the cause of a
    wicked woman.

**Iphigenia:** Is the son of the murdered man still alive at
    Argos?

**Orestes:** Alive he is, unhappy wretch, and wandering
    without a home.

**Iphigenia:** Begone, ye lying dreams, proved worthless
    after all!

**Orestes:** Even the gods, who at least bear the title of
    wise, prove no less false than flitting dreams; in
    things divine as well as human, confusion reigns;
    and ’tis only one cause of grief, when a man, through
    no folly of his own but from obeying the dictates of
    prophets, is ruined, as ruined he is in the judgment
    of those who know.

**Chorus:** Ah, well-a-day! and what is the fate of our
    dear fathers? are they still alive, or dead? who can
    tell?

**Iphigenia:** Listen, sirs, for I have hit upon a plan, I think,
    to further your interests and my own at the same
    time; and this is the best guarantee of success, if all
    approve the same object. Wouldst thou, were I to
    spare thee, return to Argos for me with a message to
    my friends there, and carry them a letter, written
    by a captive out of pity for me; for he regarded not
    mine as the hand that slew him, but held our custom
    answerable for his death, such being the view our
    goddess takes of justice? For I had no one to return
    to Argos with my message and convey my letter to
    some friend of mine, if spared; but as thou seemest
    to be a man of no mean breeding and knowest Mycenae
    and the persons I mean, accept thyself the
    means of rescue, earning a noble wage—thy safety
    for a scrap of writing; but thy friend must be parted
    from thee and offered to the goddess, for this is our
    city’s stern decree.

**Orestes:** A fair proposal, lady stranger, save in one respect.
    That he should have to bleed is a heavy weight
    upon my heart; for ’tis I who steer this troubled
    craft; he but sails with me to save my toil. Wherefore
    it is not right that I should pleasure thee on terms
    that seal his doom, while I escape myself from trouble.
    No! be this the way; give him the letter; for he
    will convey it to Argos, and so thy end is served;
    but let who will slay me. Foul shame were it for a
    man to plunge his friends into trouble and escape
    himself; and this man is a friend, whose life I prize
    as highly as my own.

**Iphigenia:** Heroic spirit! what a noble stock was thine!
    how true thou art to friends! Oh, may the last survivor
    of my race prove such another! for I, too, sirs,
    am not left brotherless; only I see him not.

    This being thy wish, I will send him to carry the
    letter, and thou shalt die; but thy goodwill towards
    him must be something great!

**Orestes:** But who will offer me and dare that awful
    deed?

**Iphigenia:** Myself; for this is the office I hold of the goddess.

**Orestes:** A sad unenviable task, fair maid.

**Iphigenia:** But I am the slave of necessity, whose law I
    must observe.

**Orestes:** Is this the hand—this woman’s hand—that
    draws the knife on men?

**Iphigenia:** Not that, but round thy brow I shall sprinkle
    lustral water.

**Orestes:** Who gives the fatal blow? if I may ask thee
    this.

**Iphigenia:** Inside this building are men, whose office this is.

**Orestes:** What kind of tomb will await me, when I am
    dead?

**Iphigenia:** The sacred fire within and a gaping chasm in
    the rock.

**Orestes:** Ah! would that a sister’s hand could lay me
    out!

**Iphigenia:** An idle prayer, poor wretch! whoever thou
    art, for her home lies far from this savage shore. Still,
    as thou art an Argive, I will not let thee want for
    aught that is in my power; I will place in thy grave
    good store of ornament and quench thy charred remains
    with yellow olive oil and will pour upon thy
    pyre the nectar sucked from many a flower by russet
    mountain bees.

    I go now to fetch my letter from the goddess’s
    temple; yet regard not this ill-will as mine.

    Watch them, guards, without binding them. It
    may be I shall send unlooked-for tidings to a friend
    in Argos, even to him whom most I love, and the
    letter announcing that they live, whom he thinks
    dead, will confirm the message of joy.

*Exit Iphigenia.*

**Chorus:** *(To Orestes)* I weep for thee, the victim of
    her fatal sprinkling.

**Orestes:** Nay, there is nothing here for tears; rather
    rejoice, ye lady strangers.

**Chorus:** *(To Pylades)* I give thee joy, young sir, on
    thy happy fortune, in that thou wilt tread thy native
    soil.

**Pylades:** No cause surely to envy a man, when his
    friends are dying!

**Chorus:** Alas, cruel mission!
    Woe is thee! thy doom is sealed. Ah! which of the
    pair is the more undone? My mind is still distraught
    with two-fold doubt whether to mourn for thee or
    thee the more.

**Orestes:** Prithee, Pylades, art thou in like case with
    myself?

**Pylades:** I know not; thy question finds me with no
    answer ready.

**Orestes:** Who is this maid? How like a daughter of
    Hellas she questioned us of the toils at Troy and the
    Achaeans’ return, of Calchas the clever augur and
    famous Achilles! What pity she expressed for Agamemnon’s
    fate, and how she pressed me about his
    wife and children! This stranger maid is haply an
    Argive by descent; else would she never have been
    sending a letter and inquiring so straitly about these
    matters, as if she shared herself in the welfare of
    Argos.

**Pylades:** Thou hast forestalled me slightly, but for all
    that thy conclusions are the same, except on one
    point; all of course who have ever had dealings with
    others hear about the misfortunes of kings. But there
    was quite another theme she discussed.

**Orestes:** What was that? divulge it to me and thou
    mayest understand it better.

**Pylades:** It is shameful that I should live and thou be
    slain; as I shared thy voyage, so ought I to share thy
    death; else shall I get a name for cowardice and
    knavery through Argos and in all the vales of Phocis;
    and the mob, being a host of knaves, will think
    that I betrayed thee and secured a return to my
    home only for myself, or haply that I murdered
    thee, while thy house was weak, devising destruction
    for thee with a view to thy throne, as the husband
    of thy sister who would succeed. This then is
    what I fear; of this I am ashamed; and it needs must
    be my bounden duty to breathe my last with thee,
    slain by the same knife and burnt on the same pyre,
    as one who was thy friend and fears reproach.

**Orestes:** Hush! my own sorrows I am bound to bear,
    and I will not double my burden of grief, when I
    may carry it single; for that grief and foul reproach
    of which thou speakest is mine, if I slay thee my
    fellow-toiler; for me, afflicted as I am by Heaven,
    ’tis not amiss to leave this life; but thou art prosperous
    and thy home is pure of taint and sound, while
    mine is cursed alike by Heaven and destiny. So save
    thyself and get children of my sister, whom I gave
    thee to wife; thus will my name live on and my father’s
    house will never be blotted out through having
    no heir. Go hence and live; make my father’s
    house thy home; but when thou art come to Hellas
    and to chivalrous Argos, I charge thee by this right
    hand, heap up my grave and lay thereon memorials
    of me, and let my sister shed a tear and strew her
    tresses on my tomb; and tell her how I perished by
    an Argive maiden’s hand, consecrated at the altar
    by bloodshed. Forsake not my sister when thou seest
    thy new kin and my father’s house forlorn; and fare
    thee well, my best of friends, for so have I ever
    found thee, fellow hunter, foster-brother, that oft
    hast borne the burden of my sorrows! ’Twas Phoebus
    who deceived us by his prophecies; and so he
    has devised a trick to drive me as far as might be
    from Hellas, for very shame of his bygone oracles;
    for, after yielding up my all to him and obeying his
    word, even to the slaying of my mother, I find myself
    undone in return.

**Pylades:** A tomb shalt thou have, my luckless friend,
    nor will I ever prove false to thy sister; for Orestes
    dead will be e’en dearer to me than Orestes living.
    Still the god’s oracle hath not destroyed thee yet,
    albeit thou standest now at the gates of death; nay,
    but misfortune at her worst sometimes admits a
    thorough change.

**Orestes:** Cease; the words of Phoebus are no help to
    me, for yonder comes the maiden from the temple.

*Enter Iphigenia.*

**Iphigenia:** *(To the guard)* Hence! go help the ministers of
    death to make their preparations within.

    Here is my letter, sirs, with its many folded leaves;
    but listen to my further wishes. As no man is the
    same under affliction as when he has suddenly passed
    from fear to confidence, I am much afraid that when
    he, who is to carry the letter to Argos, is safely on
    his way from this land, he will make my message of
    no account.

**Orestes:** What then wouldst thou? what is troubling
    thee?

**Iphigenia:** Let him give me an oath that he will convey
    this writing to Argos to the friends I wish it to reach.

**Orestes:** Wilt thou give him a similar oath in return?

**Iphigenia:** What to do? from what refrain? tell me that.

**Orestes:** To let him go forth alive from this savage
    land.

**Iphigenia:** Justly urged; for how else could he carry my
    message?

**Orestes:** But will the king agree to this?

**Iphigenia:** Yes, I will persuade him, and will myself put
    thy friend aboard.

**Orestes:** Swear then *(to Pylades)*; and do thou dictate
    some solemn oath.

**Iphigenia:** *(To Pylades)* Thou must promise to give this
    letter to my friends.

**Pylades:** I will give this letter to thy friends.

**Iphigenia:** And I will send thee safe beyond those sombre
    rocks.

**Pylades:** By which of the gods dost swear to this?

**Iphigenia:** By Artemis, in whose temple I hold my honoured
    office.

**Pylades:** And I by Heaven’s king, majestic Zeus.

**Iphigenia:** Suppose thou fail to keep this oath to my injury?

**Pylades:** May I ne’er return! and thou—what if thou
    save me not?

**Iphigenia:** May I never live to set foot in Argos!

**Pylades:** Pray, hear me on a subject we have overlooked.

**Iphigenia:** Well, ’tis not too late, provided it be opportune.

**Pylades:** Grant me one exemption; if aught happens to
    the ship and the letter goes down with the cargo
    in the waves and I save only myself, let this oath
    be no longer binding.

**Iphigenia:** Dost know what I will do? “Much adventure,
    much achieve.” I will tell thee all that is written in
    the leaves of this letter, so that thou mayst repeat it
    to my friends; yes, that insures its safety; on the one
    hand, suppose thou save the writing, the silent lines
    will of themselves tell its contents; whereas, if what
    is written here is lost at sea, thy safety will involve
    the safety of my message.

**Pylades:** A good provision for thy own interests and
    me; but signify to whom I am to carry this letter to
    Argos and likewise the message I must repeat from
    thy lips.

**Iphigenia:** Go tell Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, “Thy
    sister Iphigenia, the victim of Aulis, sends thee this
    message, being still alive, though dead to all in Argos—”

**Orestes:** Iphigenia still alive! where? is she risen from
    the dead?

**Iphigenia:** I, whom thine eyes behold, am she; distract
    me not by speaking. “Bear me to Argos, brother,
    ere I die, remove me from this savage land and from
    the goddess’s sacrifices at which I am appointed to
    slay strangers.”

**Orestes:** Pylades, what am I to say? where can we be?

**Iphigenia:** “Else will I become a curse to thy house, Orestes”;
    *(stopping to address Pylades)* thou hast heard
    the name twice to impress it on thee.

**Orestes:** Ye gods!

**Iphigenia:** Why invoke the gods in matters which only
    concern me?

**Orestes:** ’Tis nothing; read on; my thoughts had strayed
    elsewhere. Perhaps if I question thee, I shall arrive
    at the truth.

**Iphigenia:** Tell him, the goddess Artemis saved my life
    by substituting a hind in my stead, which my father
    sacrificed, when he thought he plunged the sharp
    knife in me; and she put me to dwell in this land.

    There is my message, and that is what is written
    in the letter.

**Pylades:** How easy for me to observe the oath by which
    thou hast bound me! how fair thine own! I will
    make no long delay, but ratify what I have
    sworn.

    There! Orestes, I bring this letter and deliver it
    to thee from this lady, thy sister.

**Orestes:** I accept it, but letting its folded pages wait
    awhile I will first indulge my joy, not in mere words.
    *(Approaching to embrace Iphigenia)* My own dear
    sister! struck with wonder though I am, I yet will
    fold thee to my doubting heart and rejoice in my
    wondrous news.

**Chorus:** Thou hast no right, sir stranger, to pollute the
    handmaid of our goddess by throwing thy arms about
    her holy robes.

**Orestes:** Oh! turn not from me, sister mine, sprung
    from Agamemnon like myself, now that thou hast
    found thy brother beyond all expectation.

**Iphigenia:** Found my brother in thee! A truce to this
    idle talk! Why, Argos and Nauplia are filled with
    his presence now.

**Orestes:** That is not where he dwells, poor maid.

**Iphigenia:** Can thy mother have been a daughter of Spartan
    Tyndareus?

**Orestes:** Yes, and my father a grandson of Pelops.

**Iphigenia:** What dost thou say? hast any proof to give
    me of this?

**Orestes:** I have; ask me something about our father’s
    home.

**Iphigenia:** Nay, ’tis surely for thee to speak, for me to
    answer.

**Orestes:** Well, I will tell thee first a story I heard Electra
    tell; knowest thou aught of a quarrel ’twixt
    Atreus and Thyestes?

**Iphigenia:** I have heard that they fell out about a golden
    lamb.

**Orestes:** Canst thou remember broidering this on the
    fine texture of thy web?

**Iphigenia:** Dearest brother! thou comest very near my
    heart.

**Orestes:** Hast thou forgotten the picture on thy loom,
    the changing of the sun-god’s course?

**Iphigenia:** That was the very pattern I embroidered with
    fine-woven thread!

**Orestes:** Next, didst thou receive the bridal bath sent
    by thy mother to Aulis?

**Iphigenia:** I have not forgotten; that marriage was not
    so happy as to take away the memory of it.

**Orestes:** Once more, dost remember giving a lock of
    hair to be carried to thy mother?

**Iphigenia:** Aye, as a memorial of myself for my tomb in
    place of my body.

**Orestes:** Next will I name as proofs what I have seen
    myself; the ancient spear of Pelops in our father’s
    house, hidden away in thy maiden-bower, that spear
    he brandished in his hand to slay Oenomaus and win
    Hippodamia, Pisa’s prize.

**Iphigenia:** Orestes, O my brother dear, dearer than aught
    else to me, I hold thee in my arms, my best-beloved,
    far from Argos, the home of our fathers.

**Orestes:** And I hold thee, whom all thought dead;
    while tears, that are not tears of sorrow, with grief
    and joy commingling, bedew alike thy eyes and
    mine.

**Iphigenia:** I left thee in our halls a new-born babe, still
    in thy nurse’s arms, that fatal day. O blest in fortune
    past all words to tell! What can I say? These
    things have come upon us transcending wonder or
    description.

**Orestes:** May we be happy together for the future!

**Iphigenia:** Good friends, I feel a strange unwonted joy;
    my only fear is that he will fly from my arms and
    soar away into the air.

    All hail, Cyclopean hearths and homes! my country,
    dear Mycenae, hail! I thank thee, yea, I thank
    thee both for life and bringing up, for that thou
    hast reared my brother from his youth to be a light
    unto our house.

**Orestes:** Lucky in our birth, sister, were we, but our
    life has not proved so lucky in its haps.

**Iphigenia:** Ah me! how well I recollect the day when
    my wretched father held the sword-blade at my
    throat!

**Orestes:** Horrible! I seem to see thee there, though I
    was not present.

**Iphigenia:** I remember, brother, being taken away by
    trickery, as if to wed Achilles; no marriage-hymn
    was sung; but instead were tears and wailing at the
    altar. Woe for the water sprinkled on me there!

**Orestes:** And I repeat, woe for our father’s reckless
    deed!

**Iphigenia:** ’Twas no true father meted out that fate to
    me, and now one trouble is following on another—

**Orestes:** Yes, if thou hadst slain thy brother, hapless
    maid.

**Iphigenia:** By some god’s intervention. Oh! that I should
    have dared so dire a crime! Alas! brother, I ventured
    on a fearful deed; thou didst but just escape an unholy
    doom, death at my hands. How will the matter
    end? what will be my fate? what means can I discover
    to convey thee hence from this murderous
    land to thy home in Argos, before the sword requires
    thy blood? Ah, suffering soul! ’tis thy business
    to devise a means for this. Wilt thou fly by
    land, not on shipboard, relying on thy speed of
    foot? Why, then thou wilt have death ever at thy
    elbow, as thou farest through savage tribes and over
    pathless ways; it must be the narrow passage ’twixt
    “the misty rocks” after all, a tedious course for ships
    to run.

    Ah me! a hapless lot is mine. What god or man or
    unforeseen event could bring about a happy release,
    a deliverance from trouble for the two survivors of
    the house of Atreus?

**Chorus:** This that I have seen with mine eyes, not
    merely heard men tell may rank with miracles; ’tis
    stranger than fiction.

**Pylades:** Orestes, it is natural for friends to embrace
    each other when they meet, but thou must leave
    lamenting and face that other question as well, how
    we are to escape from this savage land, with our
    safety honourably secured. For the wise man’s way,
    when once he gets a chance, is not to indulge in
    pleasures foreign to it, abandoning his fortune.

**Orestes:** Thou art right; and fortune, I feel sure, is bent
    on helping our efforts here; for if a man exerts himself,
    the gods naturally have greater power.

**Iphigenia:** *(To Pylades)* Thou shalt not stop me or prevent
    me from first inquiring how Electra fares; for
    any news of her will be welcome to me.

**Orestes:** Here is her husband *(pointing to Pylades)*,
    with whom she leads a happy life.

**Iphigenia:** What is his country? who his sire?

**Orestes:** His father’s name is Strophius, a Phocian.

**Iphigenia:** Why then, he is the son of Atreus’ daughter
    and my kinsman?

**Orestes:** Thy cousin, yes; my one loyal friend.

**Iphigenia:** He was not born, when my father sought my
    life.

**Orestes:** No, for Strophius had no son for some time.

**Iphigenia:** My sister’s husband, hail!

**Orestes:** My saviour too and no mere kinsman.

**Iphigenia:** How didst thou bring thyself to that awful
    deed regarding our mother?

**Orestes:** Let us say nothing of the deed; ’twas my
    vengeance for my sire.

**Iphigenia:** What was her reason for slaying her husband?

**Orestes:** Forego our mother’s story; ’tis no tale for thy
    ears.

**Iphigenia:** I say no more; but does Argos now look up to
    thee?

**Orestes:** Menelaus is king, and I an exile from my
    country.

**Iphigenia:** Surely our uncle never so insulted our afflicted
    house?

**Orestes:** No, but the fear of the avenging fiends drives
    me from the land.

**Iphigenia:** Then that explains the story of thy madness
    even here upon the beach.

**Orestes:** This is not the first time I have been seen in
    my misery.

**Iphigenia:** I understand; the goddesses were chasing thee
    on account of thy mother’s murder.

**Orestes:** To put a bloody bridle in my mouth.

**Iphigenia:** But why was it to this land thou didst guide
    thy steps?

**Orestes:** I came obedient to an oracle of Phoebus.

**Iphigenia:** With what intent? Is it a secret or may it be
    told?

**Orestes:** I will tell thee. All my sorrows date from this;
    after my mother’s punishment—of which I say nothing—
    had devolved on me, I was chased into exile
    by vengeful fiends in hot pursuit, till Loxias at last
    guided my footsteps to Athens to make atonement
    to the unnamed goddesses; for there is there a holy
    tribunal, which Zeus set up one day to try Ares for
    some pollution, it is said. Now, on my arrival at
    Athens, not one of my friends was ready to receive
    me at first, as a man abhorred by Heaven; afterwards
    they, who had pity on me, supplied me with
    stranger’s cheer at a table apart, being in the same
    room with me, but by their silence they contrived
    to exclude me from conversation, that I might keep
    aloof from their eating and drinking; and, filling
    each man’s cup with the same measure of wine for
    all, they were enjoying themselves. I meantime did
    not presume to question my hosts, but was sorrowing
    in silence and pretending not to notice it, though
    grieving bitterly that I was my mother’s murderer.
    Moreover, I hear that amongst the Athenians my
    misfortunes have become the occasion for a festival,
    and the custom yet survives of the people of Pallas
    honouring the pitcher. But when I came to Ares’
    hill and stood my trial, I on one platform, the eldest
    of the vengeful fiends upon the other, Phoebus, having
    made his speech and heard the evidence about
    my mother’s murder, saved me by his testimony,
    and Pallas, counting out the votes in her hand, made
    them equal for me; so I came off triumphant in the
    murder-trial. Thereon as many of the avenging fiends
    as agreed with the verdict and were for settling
    there, resolved to have a temple close to the tribunal;
    but such of them as concurred not with the
    precedent, continued to persecute me in restless pursuit,
    till once again I sought the hallowed soil of
    Phoebus, and stretching myself starving before his
    shrine, I swore to end my life then and there, unless
    he who had ruined me would find me salvation;

# Iphigenia Among the Tauri

(Lines 1003-1044)

**Orestes:**
whereupon the voice of Phoebus pealed from his
golden tripod, and he sent me hither to fetch the
image, which fell from heaven, and set it up in At-
tica. Help me then to compass the means of safety
he has appointed me; for if I can secure the image of
the goddess, I shall not only cease from my mad fits,
but setting out on well-rowed ship restore thee to
Mycenae once again. Ah! my sister, well-beloved!
preserve thy father’s house and send me hence in
safety; for I and the fortunes of Pelops’ race are
utterly undone, unless we secure the image of the
goddess, that fell from heaven.

**Chorus:**
Some god’s dire anger once burst forth against
the seed of Tantalus, and it is leading them through
trouble.

**Iphigenia:**
It was long my eager wish, brother, even be-
fore thy coming, to be at Argos and see thee face to
face; and my desire is thine, to set thee free from
suffering and restore my father’s stricken house, har-
bouring no angry thoughts towards him who would
have slain me; for so should I be spared thy blood
and save my house; but how am I to elude the god-
dess, and the king, when he finds the stone pedestal
robbed of its image? That is my fear. How shall I
escape death? What account can I give? If thou canst
combine the acts of carrying off the image and plac-
ing me upon thy gallant ship, the risk becomes worth
running; but, once I am separated from it, I am lost,
although thou mayest succeed in thy enterprise and
find a safe return; not that I shrink from death—if
die I must—when I have saved thee; no, indeed! for
a man’s loss from his family is felt, while a woman’s
is of little moment.

**Orestes:**
I will never be thy murderer as well as my
mother’s; enough that I have shed her blood! With
thee I fain would live one life or dying share the
self-same fate. For if I fall not here myself, I will
take thee home, or else remain and die with thee.
Hear my reasoning; were this opposed to the will of
Artemis, how could Loxias have bidden me carry
the image of the goddess to the citadel of Pallas?
.... and see thy face; wherefore, putting all these
facts together, I am hopeful of securing our return.

**Iphigenia:**
How can we possibly escape death and likewise
achieve our object? That is the weak point in our
homeward route; that is what we must devise.

**Orestes:**
Could we contrive to kill the king?

**Iphigenia:**
That is a fearful risk, for new-comers to slay
their hosts.

**Orestes:**
But we must run the risk, if it will save us.

**Iphigenia:**
I commend your zeal, but you could not suc-
ceed.

**Orestes:**
Well, suppose thou wert to hide me stealthily
in yonder fane?

**Iphigenia:**
That we might avail ourselves of the darkness,
I suppose, and escape?

**Orestes:**
Yes, for darkness is the robber’s day; the light
was made for truth.

**Iphigenia:**
There are guards inside the temple, whom we
cannot elude.

**Orestes:**
Alas! we are utterly undone; how are we to
escape?

**Iphigenia:**
I have hit upon a novel scheme, methinks.

**Orestes:**
Of what kind? Impart thy thoughts to me,
that I may know it too.

**Iphigenia:**
I will make a cunning use of thy troubles.

**Orestes:**
No doubt thou wilt; women are clever at in-
venting tricks.

**Iphigenia:**
I shall say thou art a matricide fresh from
Argos.

**Orestes:**
Make use of my misfortunes, if it will serve
thy turn.

**Iphigenia:**
And I shall tell them thou art no proper sacri-
fice for the goddess—

**Orestes:**
What reason canst thou give? I half suspect.

**Iphigenia:**
Because thou art unclean; whereas I must have
what is pure to offer.

**Orestes:**
And how does this bring the goddess’s image
any nearer capture?

**Iphigenia:**
It will be my wish to purify thee in fresh seawater.

**Orestes:**
Still is the image left in the temple, and that
was our object in sailing hither.

**Iphigenia:**
I will say I must wash it also, as if thou hadst
touched it.

**Orestes:**
But where? Is it a sea-filled creek thou mean-
est?

**Iphigenia:**
There where thy ship is riding at anchor,
moored with ropes.

**Orestes:**
Will the image be in thy hands or some other’s?

(Lines 1043-1104)

**Iphigenia:**
In mine, for I alone may touch it.

**Orestes:**
What part will Pylades have assigned him in
the murder?

**Iphigenia:**
He will be described as having the same stain
on his hands as thou hast.

**Orestes:**
Wilt thou do this unknown to the king or
with his knowledge?

**Iphigenia:**
After persuading him, for I could never elude
his vigilance.

**Orestes:**
Well, at any rate the ship is there with its oars
ready to smite the waves. Thy business must it be
to see that all else is well arranged. One thing alone
is wanting, these ladies’ secrecy; implore them and
find persuasive arguments; woman is gifted with a
power of moving sympathy; and for the rest, all per-
haps may turn out well.

**Iphigenia:**
Dearest friends, I look to you; on you my for-
tunes are hanging, whether for weal or woe, and loss
of fatherland and brother and sister dear.
Be this the text of what I have to say—our
womanhood, with its kindly feeling towards members
of our sex, and our intense loyalty in preserving se-
crets, that affect us all. For my sake hold your peace
and help us might and main to escape; an honour to
its owner is a trusty tongue. Now ye see how a single
chance is left these three fast friends, either to re-
turn to their fatherland or die here. If once my safety
is secured, I will bring thee safe to Hellas, that thou
mayst also share my fortune. To thee, and thee
*(addressing different members of the chorus)* I make my
prayer by thy right hand; to thee by thy dear cheek,
thy knees, and all thou prizest most at home, by
father, mother, aye, and babes, if there be any moth-
ers here. What say ye? Which of you assents to this
and which refuses? Speak; for if ye agree not to my
proposal, both I and my luckless brother are lost.

**Chorus:**
Take heart, dear lady mine; only save thyself;
for thou shalt find me dumb, wherever thou enjoin-
est silence; so help me mighty Zeus!

**Iphigenia:**
A blessing on you for those words! may happi-
ness be yours! ’Tis now thy part and thine *(to Orestes
and Pylades)* to enter the temple, for our mon-
arch will soon be here, inquiring if the sacrifice of
the strangers is over.
Dread queen! that once didst save my life from
my father’s hand and murder dire, save me now
again, and these as well; else will the words of Loxias
cease to be believed by men because of thee. Oh!
be gracious and quit this savage shore for glorious
Athens; for ’tis not right that thou shouldst live on
here, when a city so blest may be thine.

*(Exeunt Iphigenia, Orestes, and Pylades.)*

(Lines 1105-1170)

**Chorus:**
O bird by ocean’s rocky reefs!
Thou halcyon, that singest thy hard fate in doleful song,
Whose note the well-trained ear can catch,
And know that thou art ever moaning for thy mate;
With thee I match my tearful plaint, an unwinged songstress,
Longing for the gatherings of Hellas,
For Artemis our help in childbirth,
Whose home is by the Cynthian hill with its luxuriant palm
And sprouting bay and sacred shoots of olive pale,
Welcome to Latona in her travail,
Beside the rounded eddying mere,
Where tuneful swans do service to the Muse.

Woe! for the streams of tears that coursed adown my cheeks,
What time our turrets fell, and I, the prey of oar and spear,
Was set aboard a foeman’s ship;
Then, purchased at a costly price,
Was carried to this foreign port,
Where I minister to the daughter of Agamemnon,
Priestess of the huntress queen,
Serving at altars on which sheep are never sacrificed,
And envying her that hath been always unhappy;
For if a man is born and bred in hardships,
He fainteth not under them;
But happiness is subject to change,
And to be afflicted after prosperous days
Is a grievous lot for mortals.

Home the Argive ship will bear thee, lady,
And piercing notes from mountain Pan’s wax-fastened reed,
Will cheer the rowers to their task,
And prophetic Phoebus will bring his deep-toned lyre with seven strings
And escort thee with singing to fair bright Attica.
Thee will dashing oar-blades speed away, leaving me still here;
And over the bows of thy speeding bark
The sheets will make her canvas swell
Against the forestays in the breeze.

Oh! to tread yon dazzling track
Where the fiery sun goes gladly forth,
And, when above my chamber-roof,
To rest the rapid pinions on my back!
Oh! to take my station in the dance,
Where once at noble marriages I circled round
In friendly strife of charms with my compeers,
And roused them to vie with the rich splendour of my dress,
As I drew my broidered veil about me
And shaded my cheek with clustering curls.

*(Enter Thoas.)*

**Thoas:**
Where is the warder of these temple-gates,
the maid of Hellas? Has she yet begun the rites on
the strangers? Are their bodies ablaze in the holy shrine?

**Chorus:**
Here she is, O king, to explain everything to
thee.

*(Enter Iphigenia.)*

**Thoas:**
Ha! daughter of Agamemnon, why art thou
bearing yon image of the goddess in thine arms from
the sacred pedestal?

**Iphigenia:**
Stay there, O king, at the entrance.

**Thoas:**
What news now in the temple, Iphigenia?

**Iphigenia:**
Avaunt! I say; *(turning to Thoas to explain)*
’tis in purity’s cause I utter this word.

**Thoas:**
What is thy news, requiring such a preface?
Explain.

**Iphigenia:**
The victims, sire, which ye had captured for
me are unclean.

**Thoas:**
What proof of this hast thou? or is it mere
conjecture?

**Iphigenia:**
The statue of the goddess turned away from
its position.

**Thoas:**
Of its own accord, or did an earthquake turn
it?

**Iphigenia:**
Of its own accord, and it closed its eyes.

**Thoas:**
What is the cause? the strangers’ pollution?

**Iphigenia:**
Yes, that and nothing else; they have com-
mitted a crime.

**Thoas:**
Can they have slain one of my subjects on the
beach?

(Lines 1171-1206)

**Iphigenia:**
They brought the guilt of murder with them—
the guilt of kindred slain.

**Thoas:**
Who was their victim? I am desirous of learn-
ing.

**Iphigenia:**
’Twas a mother’s blood they spilt, having con-
spired to stab her.

**Thoas:**
O Apollo! even amongst barbarians none
would have had the heart to do it.

**Iphigenia:**
They were hunted from every corner of Hellas.

**Thoas:**
Is this the reason thou art carrying the image
from the shrine?

**Iphigenia:**
Yes, to remove it from the taint of bloodshed
by placing it beneath the holy firmament.

**Thoas:**
In what way didst thou discover the impurity
of these strangers?

**Iphigenia:**
When the image of the goddess turned away,
I questioned them.

**Thoas:**
Thou art a shrewd daughter of Hellas to have
guessed this so cleverly.

**Iphigenia:**
Yea, and only now they dangled before me a
tempting bait to catch my fancy.

**Thoas:**
By bringing news of those in Argos to lure
thee?

**Iphigenia:**
Good news of Orestes, my only brother.

**Thoas:**
No doubt to induce thee to spare them for
their glad tidings.

**Iphigenia:**
They said too that my father was alive and
well.

**Thoas:**
Naturally thy excuse was a reference to the
claims of the goddess.

**Iphigenia:**
Yes, for I hate all Hellas, that betrayed me.

**Thoas:**
What, pray, are we to do with the strangers?

**Iphigenia:**
We must piously observe the established cus-
tom.

**Thoas:**
Is not the lustral water ready, and thy knife?

**Iphigenia:**
My purpose is to cleanse them first by purifi-
cation.

**Thoas:**
In fresh spring water or salt sea-spray?

**Iphigenia:**
The sea washes away from man all that is ill.

**Thoas:**
True, they would then be holier victims for
the goddess.

**Iphigenia:**
Yes, and this would suit my own views better.

**Thoas:**
Well, do not the waves dash full upon the
temple-walls?

**Iphigenia:**
Solitude is necessary; for we have other duties
to perform.

**Thoas:**
Take them where thou wilt; I have no wish
to witness what may not be told.

**Iphigenia:**
I must also purify the image of the goddess.

**Thoas:**
Yes, if any taint has come upon it from the
matricides.

**Iphigenia:**
Had there been none, I should never have re-
moved it from its pedestal.

**Thoas:**
Thy piety and forethought are right.

**Iphigenia:**
Let me have the things thou knowest I
require.

**Thoas:**
’Tis for thee to name those wants.

**Iphigenia:**
Load the strangers with fetters.

**Thoas:**
Whither could they escape from thee?

**Iphigenia:**
Good faith is quite unknown among Hellenes.

**Thoas:**
*(To his servants)* Away, and bind them, sirrahs!

**Iphigenia:**
Next let them bring the strangers forth.

(Lines 1206-1250)

**Thoas:**
It shall be done.

**Iphigenia:**
After drawing a veil over their heads—

**Thoas:**
In presence of the radiant sun.

**Iphigenia:**
Send some of thy attendants with me.

**Thoas:**
Here are those who will form thy escort.

**Iphigenia:**
Also dispatch a messenger to warn the citizens.

**Thoas:**
What will happen?

**Iphigenia:**
To remain indoors, all of them.

**Thoas:**
Lest they meet with murderers?

**Iphigenia:**
Aye, for such things bring pollution.

**Thoas:**
*(To a servant)* Hence and proclaim this!

**Iphigenia:**
Above all must my friends—

**Thoas:**
Thou meanest me.

**Iphigenia:**
Keep wholly out of sight.

**Thoas:**
Thou takest good heed for the city’s weal.

**Iphigenia:**
No wonder.

**Thoas:**
No wonder the whole city looks up to thee.

**Iphigenia:**
Do thou stay here before the shrine to help
the goddess.

**Thoas:**
With what object?

**Iphigenia:**
Purify the building with torches.

**Thoas:**
That thou mayst find it pure on thy return?

**Iphigenia:**
As soon as the strangers pass out—

**Thoas:**
What must I do?

**Iphigenia:**
Hold thy robe before thine eyes.

**Thoas:**
To avoid the murderer’s taint?

**Iphigenia:**
But if I appear to be tarrying over long—

**Thoas:**
Is there to be any limit to my waiting?

**Iphigenia:**
Feel no surprise.

**Thoas:**
Take thine own time and serve the goddess
well.

**Iphigenia:**
Oh may this purification have the end I wish!

**Thoas:**
I add my prayers to that.

*(Exit Thoas.)*

**Iphigenia:**
Behold, I see the strangers just leaving the
temple with ornaments for the goddess and young
lambs for me to purge the taint of blood by shed-
ding more; with blazing torches too, and all else
that I myself prescribed for the cleansing of the
strangers and the goddess.
Away from this pollution, citizens! each warden
of the temple-gates keeping pure his hands in Heav-
en’s service; whoso is eager to marry a wife; all wom-
en labouring with child; hence! hence! away! that
this pollution cross not your path.
*(Aside)* Virgin Queen, daughter of Zeus and Latona!
if I wash the murderers of their guilt and sacrifice
where ’tis right I should, thy temple will be pure for
thy habitation, and we shall be blest; more I say not,
but still my meaning is plain to thee, goddess, and to
those like thee who know the rest.

*(Exit Iphigenia.)*

(Lines 1251-1314)

**Chorus:**
Fair was the child Latona bore one day
In the fruitful vales of Delos,
A babe with golden hair,
Well skilled in harping and his darling archery,
And, leaving the scene of her glorious travail,
She brought him from that sea-beat ridge
To the peak of Parnassus, parent of gushing streams,
Where Dionysus holds his revels.
There ’neath the shade of leafy bays
A speckled snake with blood-red eyes,
Armoured in gleaming scales, an earth-born monster,
Huge, terrific, kept guard o’er the oracle beneath the ground;
But thou, whilst yet a babe still struggling in thy mother’s arms,
Didst slay him, Phoebus, and enter on most holy prophecy,
And thou sittest on the golden tripod, thy throne of truth,
Dispensing Heaven’s oracles to men from beneath the sanctuary,
In thy home at earth’s centre, hard by the founts of Castaly.

But when Apollo’s coming had dispossessed
Earth’s daughter, Themis, of the holy oracles,
Her mother raised a brood of nightly phantoms seen in dreams,
Telling to many a mortal wight, as he lay asleep in the darkness,
What has been and yet shall be;
And Earth, jealous for her daughter’s sake,
Robbed Phoebus of the honour of his oracles;
But he, the prince, went hurrying off to Olympus
And twined his childish arms round Zeus’s throne,
Beseeching him to take from his Pythian home
The visions nightly sent by angry Earth;
And Zeus smiled to see his son come straight to him,
Because he would keep his worship, rich in precious gifts;
And he nodded his locks, promising to stop the voices heard at night,
And took from mortals the divination of darkness,
Restoring his honours to Loxias,
And to mortals their confidence in the oracles
He chanted on his throne amid the throng of pilgrims.

*(Enter Messenger.)*

**Messenger:**
Guardians of the temple and ministers
of the altar, where is Thoas the king of this land?
Throw wide those bolted doors and call the monarch
outside the building.

**Chorus:**
What is wrong? If I may speak unbidden.

**Messenger:**
The pair of youths have disappeared, seeking
to fly the land, by the tricks of Agamemnon’s child,
and they have taken the sacred statue in the hold of
their ship.

**Chorus:**
Incredible! But the king of the land, whom
thou wishest to see, has already left the shrine in hot
haste.

**Messenger:**
Whither away? for he must be told what is
happening.

**Chorus:**
We know not; but set off in pursuit, and,
when thou hast found him, tell thy news.

**Messenger:**
See how treacherous women are! Ye have had
some share in these doings.

**Chorus:**
Art mad? What have we to do with the stran-
gers’ escape? Away and lose no time in reaching thy
master’s gates!

**Messenger:**
Not until someone makes this point quite
clear, whether the ruler of the land is in the shrine
or not. What ho! unbar the doors! To those inside I
call; tell my master I am here at the gate with heavy
news for him.

*(Thoas appearing at the temple door.)*

**Thoas:**
Who is raising this uproar at the temple,
battering the doors and spreading panic within?

**Messenger:**
These women tried to get me away, asserting
falsely that thou wert gone forth, though in the
temple all the time.

**Thoas:**
What did they expect to gain? What was their
object?

**Messenger:**
I will tell thee about them later; listen now
to the matter in hand. The maid Iphigenia, who
used to be the priestess here, has fled the land with
the strangers, taking the goddess’s holy image with
her; that cleansing was all a sham.

(Lines 1315-1369)

**Thoas:**
How now? what evil influence possessed her?

**Messenger:**
In her efforts to save Orestes. Yes, that will
astonish thee.

**Thoas:**
Which Orestes? him whom the daughter of
Tyndareus bare?

**Messenger:**
Him whom our goddess consecrated to herself
at her altar.

**Thoas:**
Miraculous event! How can I find too strong
a name for thee?

**Messenger:**
Turn not thy attention thither, but listen
to me; and, when thou hast heard all and weighed
the matter, devise a means of pursuit to hunt the
strangers down.

**Thoas:**
Say on, for thy words are good; ’tis no short
voyage they have before them, that so they can es-
cape my ships.

**Messenger:**
As soon as we reached the beach where the
ship of Orestes was moored in hiding, the daughter
of Agamemnon signed to us, whom thou sentest with
her to carry fetters for the strangers, to stand aloof,
as if she were about to light the mystic flame and
offer the cleansing rites, which she had come to per-
form. Holding in her hands the cord that bound the
strangers, she went on behind them. This seemed
suspicious, sire, but thy attendants were satisfied.
After a while, to make us think she was really doing
something unusual, she lifted up her voice and began
chanting magic spells in a strange tongue, as if for-
sooth she were cleansing them of their blood-guilti-
ness. Now after we had continued sitting a long
time, it occurred to us that the strangers might have
broken loose and slain her and taken to flight; still
as we were afraid of witnessing what we ought not
to have seen, we remained seated in silence, until
at last the same proposal was made by all of us, to
go to them, although no leave was given. And there
we see the hull of a vessel of Hellas with winged
broadside of oar-blades fitted to it, and fifty sailors,
oar in hand, at the tholes, and the youths, now free,
standing astern the ship; while some were steadying
the prow with poles, others hanging the anchor to
the cat-heads, and the rest hauling in cables, getting
ladders ready the while and letting them down into
the sea for the strangers’ use. Now when we saw
their crafty tricks, we laid hold of the stranger maid
and the hawsers recklessly, trying at the same time
to unship the helm from the gallant craft through
its rudderport; and words passed between us: “What
pretext have ye for this stealthy raid on images and
priestesses from our land? Who, and whose son art
thou that seekest to smuggle this maiden hence?”
And answer came, “I am Orestes, the son of Agamemnon,
this maiden’s own brother, that thou mayst
learn the truth; for she whom I am taking hence
with me is the sister I once lost from my home.”
Nonetheless we held the stranger maid and were
for forcing her to follow us to thee, and that was
how my cheeks came by these fearful blows; for they
had no weapons in their hands, nor yet had we; but
there was sturdy buffeting of fists, and likewise feet
were aimed at side and heart by both those youths,
so we closed with them and were at once exhausted.
Then we fled to the cliff, most terribly marked,
covered with bloody weals, some on their heads and
others on their eyes; but once stationed on the rocks,
we fought more cautiously and began by pelting
them with stones; but archers, posted on the stern,
kept us off with arrows, compelling us to retire to a
distance. Meantime a monster wave had driven the
vessel shoreward, and as the maiden feared to wet
her feet, Orestes took his sister on his left shoulder,
and, stepping into the sea, he leapt upon the ladder
and set her down inside the gallant ship, with the
image of the daughter of Zeus, which fell from
heaven. Anon a voice was heard speaking from the
vessel’s midst, “Ye mariners of Hellas! grip your
oars and dash the billows into foam, for now the
prize is ours, which we sailed to the Euxine Sea to
win, through the jaws of the clashing rocks.”

(Lines 1370-1433)

**Messenger:**
With deep-drawn sighs of joy they smote the
brine, and the ship made way, so long as she was
inside the haven, but, meeting a furious surge, as
she was crossing the harbour-bar, she began to la-
bour; for on a sudden a tempestuous wind arose and
forced her shoreward stern foremost; and the rowers
tugged and strained to fight the wave, but still its
backward wash would drive their ship to land again.
Then Agamemnon’s daughter rose and prayed, “O
daughter of Latona, save me, bring thy priestess
unto Hellas out of this savage land, and pardon my
theft. As thou, O goddess, lovest thy brother, so
believe that I too love my kith and kin.” Therewith
the sailors sang their paean to second the maiden’s
prayer, and, baring their arms from the shoulder
down, gripped their oars tightly at the boatswain’s
cry. But ever nearer to the rocks the ship drew on,
and some sprang into the sea, others began fastening
twisted nooses to the shore; while I was straightway
sent hither to thee, my liege, to announce what had
befallen there. So haste thee hence with gyves and
cords; for, unless the waves grow calm, those stran-
gers have no hope of safety.
It is Poseidon, majestic ruler of the main, who is
regarding Ilium with favour but frowning on the
race of Pelops; and now, it seems, he will deliver up
into thy hands and the hands of thy subjects the son
of Agamemnon with his sister, for she stands con-
victed of faithlessness to the goddess in forgetting
the sacrifice at Aulis.

*(Exit Messenger.)*

**Chorus:**
Alas for thee, Iphigenia! once more within
the tyrant’s clutch thou wilt be slain with thy
brother.

**Thoas:**
Ho! every dweller in this foreign land, up and
bridle your steeds and gallop to the beach! there
await the stranding of the Hellenes’ ship, and then
hunt the godless wretches eagerly with the help of
the goddess. Go, you others, and launch my swiftest
galleys, that we may either overhaul them by sea or
ride them down by land and hurl them headlong
from a precipice or impale their limbs on stakes.
*(Turning to the chorus)* As for you women, their
accomplices herein, I will punish you hereafter, when
I have leisure, but now with the present business
before me, I will not remain idle.

(Lines 1433-1463)

*(Athena appears above the stage.)*

**Athena:**
Whither, King Thoas, whither art thou
carrying this pursuit? Hearken to the words of
Athena who is here. Cease pursuing or sending sol-
diers streaming after them; for Orestes was destined
by Apollo’s oracle to come hither, first to escape the
fury of the avenging fiends, and then to convey his
sister home to Argos and the sacred image to my
land, a respite from his present afflictions. This I
say to thee; and for Orestes, whom thou thinkest to
catch at sea and slay, e’en now is Poseidon guiding
him hence on his ship for my sake, smoothing the
surface of the deep.
Orestes—thou hearest the voice, for it is a god-
dess speaking, although thou art not here—mark
well my hests, take the image and thy sister, and go
hence; and when thou art come to Athens, that god-
built town, thou wilt find a spot upon the utmost
bounds of Attica, bordering on Carystus’ ridge, a
holy place called *Halae* by my people. There build
a temple and set up the image, named after the
Taurian land and the labours long endured by thee
in ranging Hellas to and fro through the goading of
avenging fiends. Henceforth shall mortal men chant
her praises as Artemis the Taurian goddess. Ordain
this law also; when the people celebrate her festival,
the priest, to compensate her for thy sacrifice, must
hold his knife to a human throat and blood must
flow to satisfy the sacred claims of the goddess, that
she may have her honours.
As for thee, Iphigenia, thou must keep her temple-
keys at Brauron’s hallowed path of steps;[^1] there shalt
thou die and there shall they bury thee, honouring
thee with offerings of robes, e’en all the finely-woven
vestments left in their homes by such as die in child-
birth. *(To Thoas)* And I charge thee send these
daughters of Hellas on their way hence because of
their righteous decision. I saved thee once be-
fore, Orestes, when I allotted the votes equally on
the hill of Ares; and this shall be an ordinance; who-
ever secures an equal division of votes wins his case.
So bear thy sister from the land, son of Agamemnon,
and thou, Thoas, be no longer angry.

(Lines 1464-1499)

**Thoas:**
Whoso hears the voice of God and disobeys
is no sane man, O queen Athena. For my part, I am
not wroth with Orestes or his sister, though he has
taken the image hence; for what credit is there in
struggling with the mighty gods? Let them go with
the goddess’s image to thy land and there erect it to
their joy. Moreover I will send these women to Hel-
las, their happy home, as thou commandest me, and
will check my spear which I am lifting against the
strangers, and stop the sailing of my ships, since this
is thy good pleasure, goddess.

**Athena:**
Well said; for necessity is stronger than thee,
aye, and than the gods.
Go, ye breezes, waft the son of Agamemnon on
his way to Athens; and I myself will share his voy-
age, keeping the image of my sister safe.

**Chorus:**
Go and luck go with you, happy in your pres-
ervation!
Hail to thee! Pallas Athena, name revered by
deathless gods as well as mortal men! we will per-
form all thy bidding; for very welcome and unlooked
for are the words I have heard.
Most holy Victory! possess my life and never
grudge thy crown!

*(Exeunt omnes.)*
