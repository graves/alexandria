Orestes.  
> O Chthonian Hermes, steward of thy Sire,  
> Receive my prayer, save me, and fight for my cause;  
> For I am journeyed back from banishment,  
>  
> And on this mounded sepulchre I call  
> On my dead sire to listen and give ear.

This lock to Inachus for nurture; this  
For mourning.

Father, I was not by to wail thy death  
Or with stretched hand dispatch thine exsequies.

What’s this? Look you; what company of women  
With such ostent of sable stoles attired  
Moves on its way? What trouble’s in the wind?  
Hath some fresh sorrow fallen on the house?  
Or bring they these libations for my father,  
As my heart tells me, to appease the Shades?  
It cannot be aught else; there is my sister,  
Electra, walking with them, and she wears  
A woeful look. O Zeus, give me to avenge  
My father’s murder, fight upon my side.  
Pylades, let’s withdraw; I would fain know  
What may this woman’s supplication mean.

(They withdraw, and the Chorus enter with Electra.)

Chorus.  
> Forth from the house they bid me speed  
> With graveyard-cups to pour; and these ill-tuned,  
> Ungentle hands, quick-throbbing, drum-beat sent:  
>  
> These cheeks in tender witness bleed,  
> A fresh-turned fallow with a gleaming wound;  
> And my heart’s bread is evermore lament.  
>  
> I tore my robe of fair tissue  
> And the poor rags, methought, with anguish cried,  
> Being too linen-soft and delicate  
> To be so wronged; or, as they knew,  
> They wrapped a breast where laughter long had died,  
> Or wailed a new malignancy of Fate.  
>  
> A shriek it was, a shrill nightmare  
> That broke from the bower, and where we women slept  
> In heaviness and sullen anger passed.  
>  
> And they whose judgment can expound  
> The meaning of such dreams, let a great cry,  
> The word of power that doth God’s word engage:  
>  
> “Underneath the earth’s dark ground  
> Are grieving spirits wroth exceedingly;  
> And ’tis against their murderers they rage.”  
>  
> And now with gifts wherein is no remedy  
> I come these woes to ward;  
> For, oh, Earth-Mother, thus in her sore need  
> Woos pardon and peace a woman God-abhorred.  
> How dare I breathe that word? Where shall be found  
> Ransom for blood that’s drenched the ground?  
>  
> O hearth! Calamity enwraps;  
> O royal siege, swift Ruin saps;  
> What sunless glooms of Night inhearsed,  
> By human horror held accursed,  
> Darkeneth thee, thou house of pride,  
> For the deaths thy masters died?  
>  
> The sovereign awe uncombated, unquelled,  
> That through the general ear  
> Smote on the common heart, hath now rebelled;  
> And yet, God wot, there are who fear.  
>  
> Our infirm flesh boon Fortune deifies;  
> The man, grown God, high God outvies.  
>  
> But Judgment swings through her swift arc  
> And censuring all doth poise and weigh:  
>  
> And she can set a soul in light,  
> Or on the confine of the dark  
> The lingering agony delay;  
> Or whelm with elemental night.  
>  
> Blood, and more blood; ’tis drunk of the dark ground;  
> This earth that bred it kneads it in her clay,  
> Till it become, indissolubly bound,  
> A Power, that shall itself arise and slay.  
>  
> Ate, with no hot haste to Vengeance spurs,  
> Though tireless in pursuit, once entered in;  
> Still she adjourns; the Day of Doom defers,  
> Till there be full sufficiency of Sin.  
>  
> For terror wild with lifted hair  
> Wrung from the soul of sleep, dark dream-adept,  
> In the dead hour of night a cry aghast:  
>  
> Who hath unlatched the door of chastity,  
> Enforcing there the bridal bliss embowered,  
> Shall never turn again the golden key;  
> And ravished once is evermore deflowered.  
>  
> So, though all streams be affluent to one end,  
> Lucid and sweet to wash away the stain  
> Of blood from guilty hands, they do but spend  
> Their onward-flowing clarity in vain.  
>  
> But I — the hard constraint of heaven  
> Environing my city; driven  
> From home, my portion slavery —  
>  
> If good or evil they debate,  
> Must smother up my bitter hate  
> And be the mute of sovereignty.  
>  
> And yet behind my veil I weep  
> My rightful master’s wasted days,  
> And this hush sorrow on me lays  
> The ache of winter’s frozen sleep.

Electra.  
Bondmaids, the household’s rule and regimen,  
Since in this office ye are postulants with me,  
I pray you counsel me herein.  
What shall I say when these kind cups I pour?  
How find fair words to vow them to my sire?  
“Love’s gift to love” — shall I commend them so?  
“Husband from wedded wife”? Oh, not from her,  
Not from my mother; I should want for that  
A tongue of brass; I have no form of prayer  
To pour these offerings on my father’s grave.  
Or shall I come with customary terms  
And ask a blessing on their heads that sent  
These garlands; for fair deeds, fair recompense?  
Or, in dishonouring silence, as my father  
Perished, drain out the drench for Earth to drink,  
And get me hence; like one that casts out filth,  
Fling the crock from me with averted looks?  
Resolve me, friends, that you may share my blame;  
We live in a community of hate;  
Hide not your heart’s deep thoughts for any fear;  
The thing determined waiteth for the free  
And him that’s at another’s beck and nod.  
Know you a better way, acquaint me with it.

Chorus.  
Awful as altar is thy father’s tomb;  
And at thy bidding I will speak my mind.

Electra.  
Speak by that awe thou ow’st his sepulchre.

Chorus.  
Pour on; but ask good things for all loyal souls.

Electra.  
Which of my friends be they? How shall I name them?

Chorus.  
Thyself, and, after, all that hate Aegisthus.

Electra.  
Then shall I offer prayer for thee and me?

Chorus.  
I see thy heart instructs thee how to pray.

Electra.  
And add no name beside?

Chorus.  
Remember yet  
Absent Orestes in thine orisons.

Electra.  
Oh, well admonished! Excellently said!

Chorus.  
Mindful of them that did the deed of blood—

Electra.  
What then? Pray on and I’ll pray after thee.

Chorus.  
Ask that on them, carnal or ghostly, come—

Electra.  
Doomster or doom’s executant?

Chorus.  
A stern Avenger; ’twill suffice; ask nothing more.

Electra.  
Is that a holy thing to ask the Gods?

Chorus.  
Nay, how should it not be a holy thing  
With evil to reward an enemy?

Electra.  
Great Herald of the Heights and Deeps, be thou  
My helper, Chthonian Hermes; cry for me,  
And bid the Spirits of the Depths give ear,  
That are the Stewards of my father’s house.  
Cry to the Earth that brings forth life and then  
Of all she nursed receives again the seed.  
I will pour these libations to the Shades,  
Saying, “O Father, have compassion on me  
And on Orestes; how shall we bring him home?  
We are sold for a price; yea, she that gave us birth  
Hath dispossessed us, taken to her bed  
Aegisthus, with her guilty of thy blood.  
I’m but a slave; banished Orestes hath  
No portion of thy substance; with thy labours  
They go apparelled in their insolence.  
I pray, not knowing how it shall befall,  
Orestes may come home: hear me, my father!  
And for myself I as a purer heart  
Than hath my mother and more innocent hands.  
This for ourselves; but on our enemies  
I pray Avenging Justice may rise up  
And hew them down, even as they hewed thee.  
And so, betwixt my prayers that ask good things  
Stands this, that imprecates evil on their heads.  
For us send benedictions, by the help  
Of Heaven and Earth and Justice Triumphant.”  
Now I pour out these cups, which you must wreathe  
With customary coronets of your cries,  
Chanting the dismal paean of the dead.

Chorus.  
> Fall, perishable tears, with plashing sound;  
> Fall for our fallen lord;  
> And, while the abominable cup is poured,  
> The rite confound;  
> The good avert,  
> And, to the miscreant’s hurt,  
> The evil bring to pass,  
> And, though death dull thy soul and deaf thine ear,  
> Hearken, O King; majestic shadow, hear!  
>  
> Alas! Alas! Alas!  
>  
> Oh, for the armed deliverer;  
> The wielder of a mighty spear;  
> The archer that shall bend against the foe,  
> Till horn meet horn, the Scythic bow,  
> Or, foot to foot and face to face,  
> Beat caitiffs to the earth with huge, self-hafted mace!

Electra.  
> Dark Earth hath drunk her potion; in his grave  
> My father hath it now. But hear what’s strange  
> And passing strange.

Chorus.  
Speak, I implore thee! Speak!  
For, oh, my fearful heart is wildly stirred!

Electra.  
Here is a lock of hair laid on the tomb.

Chorus.  
Whose? What tall youth’s? Or what deep-girdled girl’s?

Electra.  
Why, only look; it is not hard to guess.

Chorus.  
I’m an old woman, and shall youth teach me?

Electra.  
There’s none would shed a hair for him but I.

Chorus.  
Yea, foes are they should mourn with shaven head.

Electra.  
’Tis like; a feather of the self-same wing—

Chorus.  
Whose hair is’t like? I am on thorns to know.

Electra.  
’Tis very like the hair of mine own head.

Chorus.  
Not young Orestes’ gift in secret brought?

Electra.  
It is a tendril of that vine, I swear.

Chorus.  
It is? But how dared he adventure hither?

Electra.  
’Twas sent, this shearling of his filial love.

Chorus.  
That’s no less worth my tears to think that he  
Will never again set foot in his own land.

Electra.  
To me it is the surging of a sea  
Bitter as gall; an arrow through my heart.  
These tears are but the thirsty thunder-drops  
Escaped from unwept deluges; the flood  
Is yet to come. Who else that’s native here  
Could show the fellow to this goodly tress?  
Nor was it clipped by her that murdered him;  
’Tis not my mother’s: what a name is that  
For her that hates her own and denies God!  
But howsoe’er by this and that I vow  
This shining jewel is my best beloved:  
Orestes’ own, I am beguiled by hope.  
Oh me! Would it had sense; a voice to make report  
That I be shook no longer to and fro,  
But roundly bid to curse and spew it from me,  
If ’tis indeed shorn from a murderer’s head;  
Or that ’twould prove its kin and with me mourn,  
This grave’s bright ornament, my father’s pride.  
But when we call upon the Gods, they know  
By what great storms, like mariners at sea,  
We are tossed and whirled. And, if they mean to save,  
Then from small seed a mighty stem may grow.  
Ha! Here are footprints! here is double proof!  
Look! They are like! They tally with mine own!  
Nay, there’s a pair — each in outline distinct!  
He hath been here with some companion!  
Heel, length of tendon, all agrees with mine.  
The hope within me struggles to be born,  
And I am crazed until it come to birth.

Orestes (disclosing himself).  
Henceforth pay fruitful vows to the good Gods  
For answered prayer.

Electra.  
Wherefore stand I now  
So high in heaven’s favour?

Orestes.  
Thou hast sight  
Of that which thou didst pray so long to see.

Electra.  
Know’st thou whom my soul craves of all the world?

Orestes.  
I know thy heart is woe for Orestes.

Electra.  
How have my prayers prospered?

Orestes.  
Here am I;  
No further seek; for I am all thou lov’st.

Electra.  
Sir, art thou come to take me in a snare?

Orestes.  
And if I do, I plot against myself.

Electra.  
I fear you mean to mock my misery.

Orestes.  
I jest at mine, if yours can make me merry.

Electra.  
Art thou indeed Orestes?  
You are slow  
To know me when you see me face to face;  
And yet this snip of hair could give you wings;  
And when you looked upon it you saw me;  
A footprint of your make was proof but now.  
Come, put the shorn tress to the shaven head;  
Look at this stuff; ’tis of your loom; your spathe  
Smoothed it; you broidered this brave brede of beasts.  
Refrain thy heart, lest joy unhinge thy wits:  
For our dear kin are our most mortal foes.

Chorus.  
Thou darling of thy father’s house; sole hope  
Of saving seed, watered with many tears!  
Now show thy mettle; win back thine own home.

Electra.  
Thou eye that centres all sweet thoughts; four selves  
Composed in one; for there is none but thee  
Left to call father, and the tender love  
That was my mother’s ere she earned my hate,  
Yearns all to thee; and all I felt for her  
Twin-sown with me and pitilessly slain;  
And ever my true brother; my one name  
Of awe; may Power and Justice be with thee  
And Zeus, the greatest of the trinity.

Orestes.  
Zeus, Zeus, be perfect witness of these woes.  
Lo, the young eagles desolate; their sire  
Dead in the tight-drawn knot, the twisted coils  
Of a fell viperess. Orphans are we  
And faint, unfed; unable for the prey  
Our father took and to our eyrie bear —  
So stand I in thy sight; so she stands,  
The sad Electra; fatherless children both;  
And either’s home is outcast homelessness.  
The young of him, thy sacrificial priest,  
A mighty honourer of Thine, if Thou  
Cut off, what hand will such rich guerdon give?  
And if the eaglets Thou destroy, there’s none  
To send and show Thy tokens among men;  
This royal stem if it be quite consumed  
Steads not Thy altars when fat bulls are slain.  
Tend it; and out of nothingness exalt  
A house that seemeth razed even with the ground.

Chorus.  
Oh, you salvation of your father’s house,  
Hush; or some rogue, sweethearts, will hear of this  
And with his pick-thank tongue carry the tale  
To our cursed masters, whom I pray to God  
I may see fry in bubbling pinewood blaze!

Orestes.  
Great Loxias’ word shall never play me false,  
That bade me hold upon my perilous way,  
Entoning high, and horrors freezing clod,  
To make hot livers lumps of ice, forth-telling,  
If I tracked not my father’s murderers  
As they tracked him, nor took my full revenge  
With brute, bull-fury gold cannot allay:  
My life must answer for it, charged with all  
Afflictions that can rob us of our joy.  
Of death in life, earth’s sop to malice old,  
He with dread voice in our frail hearing told;  
As foul serpigoes cankering the flesh,  
Gnawing the native wholesomeness away,  
Till all be furred with the white leprosy.  
Next, of the Haunting Furies, conjured up  
To take full vengeance for a father’s blood,  
Seen in the dark, with horrible amaze  
Of eyes at stretch and twitch of tortured brows;  
And that black arrow winged by pining ghosts  
Of murdered kindred, madness and wild fear  
Shaped on the night to harry and hound him forth,  
Raw with the excommunicating scourge.  
He tastes not of the living cup; none spills  
With him the red wine in the banquet-hall;  
The sightless spirits of his father’s wrath  
Forbid him every altar; none will house  
Nor lodge with him; all sweet civilities  
Denied, and no man he may call his friend,  
He dies at last, death in each part of him,  
A mummied wretch, embalmed in rottenness.

Well — should I hearken to these oracles?  
If I do not, the deed is yet to do.  
All impulses concur to one great end;  
A God’s commands, grief for my father, loss  
Of all that I am heir to, shame and scorn  
That that most famous breed in all the world,  
High hearts that humbled Troy, my noble Argives,  
Should knee it, like knaves, to a pair of women;  
For he is not a man; or if he be  
The man he is he passing soon shall see.

Chorus.  
Ye Mighty Destinies, march on,  
God with you, till the goal be won  
Where Justice’ face is set.  
“To tongue of gall the bitter word,”  
Loud is the voice of Vengeance heard,  
When she exacts the debt.  
“To dagger-hand the dagger-law,”  
“The doer quit” — ’tis an old saw  
Whose salt hath savour yet.

Orestes.  
O father, father of our woe!  
How can I serve thee now by word or deed?  
From this far world what homing wind shall blow  
Where the Eternal Anchors hold thee fast?  
There thy long day is night:  
And at this gate of death where thou hast passed,  
Our grief that are of Atreus’ royal seed  
Is all thou hast of glory and delight.

Chorus.  
Child, the proud spirit of the dead  
Succumbs not to the ravening tooth of fire.  
Their passions work, when life is fled:  
The mourner’s wail  
Discovers him that did the wrong.  
And lamentation for a murdered sire  
A hunter is, that rallies to the trail  
All dogs that e’er gave tongue.

Orestes.  
Harken then, father, our lament,  
While at thy mounded tomb our salt tears flow;  
An alternating song, of sad concent,  
Dirged by thy children; suppliants that crave  
Access to thee; banned, both, from thy high hall,  
Met at the common refuge of thy grave.  
What’s here of good? Where’s aught that is not woe?  
And is not Doom the master of us all?

Chorus.  
But God can touch the broken strings  
To melody divine;  
And for this unrejoicing round,  
The burden of sepulchral ground,  
In the high banquet-hall of kings  
Blithe song bring in new wine.

Orestes.  
Oh, if ’neath Ilium’s wall,  
Gashed by some Lycian spear,  
Father, thou hadst fallen in fight,  
Then hadst thou left thy house great praise,  
And to thy children in the public ways  
Honour in the eyes of all.  
Then thine had been a sepulchre  
Builded of many hands beyond the sea,  
And easy would our burden be,  
And all its weight of earth how light!

Chorus.  
And in the Kingdom of the Dark,  
Welcome wert thou to souls that nobly died;  
A lord of majesty and mark,  
The cupbearer  
Of Hell’s vast Thrones; for while thou yet hadst breath  
Thou wast a King; and, in that Kingdom wide,  
Next them that the huge orb of Fate upbear,  
Their rod and sceptre — Death!

Electra.  
No, not on Troy’s far plain  
Would I have thee lie, interred,  
Where Scamander’s waters flow,  
With meaner men that fell to the spear,  
But none, oh, none, that was thy peer.  
Death should have first thy murderers slain;  
And, haply, we had heard  
Some far-off rumour of their dying,  
And never ate the bread of sighing  
Nor tasted of this cup of Woe.

Chorus.  
Thy tongue, child, tells of things more worth  
Than any weight of gold,  
Or aught of fabled bliss that’s told  
Of that far bourne beyond the bright North Star.  
So may’st thou range in fancy uncontrolled;  
But our hard hands scourge this unfeeling earth,  
And at the massy gate fast shut of old  
The summons knocks where our sole helpers are.  
They lift not white hands at heaven’s judgment bar  
Who triumph now, under God’s malison;  
Yea, and by this the children’s cause is won.

Orestes.  
Oh, ’twas fledged, that word, it clave  
The dull ear that sleeps in the grave.  
Zeus, O Zeus, if Thy command  
Conjures from the Deeps below  
Ghostly Vengeance, footing slow,  
Stretching forth an arm to gripe  
Sinful soul and felon hand,  
Evil lendings, fully ripe,  
Loan and interest shall have.

Chorus.  
Oh, to rend the air with a shout  
When in their blood they lie,  
The woman and her mate!  
What wing of Deity  
Hovers about me and about?  
I cannot hide this huge unrest;  
My spirit passionate  
Doth like a straining vessel breast  
The bitter blast of hate!

Electra.  
And when will Zeus, the strong Godhead,  
Grasp the bolt with grapplings dread  
To cleave their climbing crests amain?  
May firm affiance keep our land;  
I sue for nothing at God’s hand  
But that after oppression long  
Justice walk the world again.  
Hear, Earth; and all the Chthonian throng  
Throned in the darkness of the dead!

Chorus.  
It is the Law; when man’s blood falls  
Man’s blood shall pay full cess:  
With “Haro! Haro!” Murder calls  
God’s fell Erinyes,  
And in some late succeeding age  
For souls slain long ago  
Fresh horrors mount the bloody stage  
For blacker deeds of woe.

Orestes.  
Oho! O heigh! Ye dim Dominions!  
Princedoms of Death! Ye potent malisons  
Of murdered men! Behold and see  
Of Atreus’ noble tree  
The poor, the pitiful, the last  
Scantling, from home and kingly state outcast!  
Hear us, O Zeus, for we have none but Thee!

Chorus.  
I listen and tremble; thy cry of dole  
Fevers my heart; anon  
Faint for wanhope am I;  
It thicks my blood, it clouds my soul,  
Thy passing piteous cry!  
But when the fit is gone,  
And my fixed heart is firm to dare,  
Pain stands far off; and calm and fair  
And cool the brightening sky.

Electra.  
How move the dead? How prosper in our plea?  
Oh, what can wring them like our misery!  
This cloud that overhangs our house, these parent-pangs?  
Traitress! She could fawn and glose,  
But she can never cheat us of our woes;  
We are her children and have wolfish fangs.

Chorus.  
I beat to the sound of the Arian dirging,  
Yea, to the Kissian waiter’s cry;  
With wild hands lifted high and high,  
Clashing and clutching and tossing and surging;  
Faster, faster, never ending;  
A tempest of blows on my head descending;  
And the noise, like a hammer, dinned through my brain;  
A passion of Sorrow, a tumult of Pain!

Electra.  
Oh, mother, deep in all Damnation!  
Oh, remorseless enemy!  
A king borne out to unkind burial,  
No liegeman by!  
A husband thrust in his grave, and none  
To wail or weep or chant an orison!

Orestes.  
Ha! Did she use him so despitefully?  
She shall abye full dearly her despite!  
With Heaven to help and hands to smite,  
I’ll slay her in her blood and die!

Chorus.  
Hacked like a thief, by her that felon-wise  
Graved him; in her cold malice, that his doom  
Might insupportably thy days consume;  
These were thy father’s last death-agonies.

Electra.  
They would have none of me; humbled and chidden,  
Like a pestilent hound, a cur unwhipped,  
Closeted up in the castle-crypt;  
There in the kennelled darkness hidden  
Freelier flowed my secret weeping  
Than ever careless laughter leaping  
When the world was gay and my heart was light.  
Brother, my wrongs in the memory write!

Chorus.  
Let that thy courage brace,  
Like steel-drilled marble, mortised and made one  
With thy calm heart’s unshaken base.  
What’s done is done:  
But stick not till Expectancy behold  
The sequel: on; be firm as thou art bold.

Orestes.  
Father, be with us! Father, thee I call!

Electra.  
And I with heavy heart and streaming eyes!

Chorus.  
And all our many voices sound as one!  
Rise, oh, rise,  
And feel the sun:  
Be with us ’gainst the common enemy of all!

Orestes.  
Plea shall encounter Plea, Power grapple Power!

Electra.  
The righteous cause, ye Gods, judge righteously!

Chorus.  
I listen, and I shudder while ye pray:  
Destiny abides alway,  
But prayer can hasten on the inevitable hour!

Orestes.  
Oh, heritage of Grief! Incarnate Woe!  
Oh, Bloody Hand of Doom that jars the strings!  
Now is the voice of melody brought low!

Electra.  
Oh, how they grate, these harsh chords Sorrow wrings!

All.  
Pang on pang, and throe on throe!

Orestes.  
Within there is no styptic for this wound,  
And the wide world is powerless to aid;  
By our own hands our safety must be found.

Electra.  
Fury with fury, blood in blood be stayed.

All.  
This is our hymn to the Gods Earth-bound.

Chorus.  
Hear, ye Earth-dwellers all, that have  
Power and bliss beyond the grave!  
The seed of Childhood succour and save!

Orestes.  
Father, by thy unkingly death, grant me  
In thy high house lordship and mastery!

Electra.  
Take away my rebuke, let not men say,  
“Behold, Aegisthus’ chattel, marketed and sold!”

Orestes.  
Then, as our fathers used, feasts shall be spread  
For thee; else at the banquets of the Dead  
Among the steaming bakemeats thou shalt pine.

Electra.  
And of my rich dower, plenished from thy store,  
To thee refreshing draughts my cup shall pour;  
First of all sepulchres I will honour thine.

Orestes.  
Earth, grant our sire our combat sore to see!

Electra.  
Give, Persephassa, beauteous victory!

Orestes.  
Think, father, of the bath, thy life-blood dyed.

Electra.  
Think of the cunning-net, the deep and wide!

Orestes.  
In gyves, no smith e’er hammered, caught and bound!

Electra.  
Veilings of Shame about thee, treason-wound!

Orestes.  
Doth not that sting thee, rouse thee from thy bed?  
Wilt not lift up thy well-beloved head?

Orestes.  
Bid Justice rise and battle for thine own;  
Or let us close with them, as thou wast thrown,  
If thou wouldst quell their might that dealt thee doom!

Electra.  
Hear this last cry, my father, hear and save!  
Lo, the young eagles gather at thy grave;  
Pity the man-child and the woman’s womb!

Orestes.  
Let not this seed of Pelops be destroyed!  
For then, in spite of Death, thou art not dead.

Electra.  
Children are voices that shake off the Lethe  
Of drowsy Death; yea, floats, whereby the thread  
And thin-wove line of Being is up-buoyed  
Above the swallowing gulfs that yawn beneath.

Orestes.  
Hear for thy sake the voice of our despair;  
Thou sav’st thyself if thou receive our prayer.

Chorus.  
Right well have ye discoursed your argument,  
Fit homage to an evil fate unmourned.  
And now, since thou hast nerved thee for the act,  
Dare it, and put thy Fortune to the touch.

Orestes.  
So shall it be; ’tis nothing from my course  
To ask the meaning of these cups, and why  
Her after-scruple tends a cureless sorrow.  
Is Death a simpleton that she dares make  
Such poor amends? What shall I think of these  
Sorry bestowals for her huge offence?  
Why, if a man should lavish all he has  
For one least drop of blood, ’twere labour lost.  
I prithee, if thou canst, enlighten me.

Chorus.  
Son, I was there; she was so shook with dreams  
And terrors of the night, her wicked heart  
So scared, she tremblingly despatched these cups.

Orestes.  
Told she her dream?

Chorus.  
She did; “Methought,” she cried,  
“I was delivered of a viper!”

Orestes.  
Well, finish thy story.

Chorus.  
Then, as ’twere a child,  
She hushed and wrapped it up in cradle-clothes.

Orestes.  
And what meat craved the dragon-worm new hatched?

Chorus.  
She gave it her own breast, ay, in her dream.

Orestes.  
Did she so? Then I warrant her paps are sore.

Chorus.  
It milked her, and sucked out the curded blood.

Orestes.  
There was a meaning in this vision.

Chorus.  
She cried in her sleep and started broad awake.  
And all the palace-lamps, that hung blind-eyed  
In darkness, blazed up for the mistress’ sake.  
And, presently, she sends these loving-cups;  
She thinks them surgery for distempered thoughts.

Orestes.  
O parent earth, sepulchre of my father,  
Answer my prayer and make this dream come true!  
In my interpretation all coheres.  
For, look you, if the asp came whence I came,  
If it was wound in swaddling clothes, and gaped  
With mumbling mouth about the breast that nursed me,  
And mingled mother-milk with curded blood,  
By this, and by her shriek that saw the dream,  
Then, as she gave suck to a devilish thing,  
She dies in her blood; and I am dragon-fanged  
To kill her as the dream would have me do.

Chorus.  
Oh, good; your reading of it contents me well;  
And Heaven fulfil it; but give us first some clew:  
Which shall be actors here and who look on.

Orestes.  
In sooth, a simple story: she must within,  
And it shall be your charge to cloak my plot.  
So, as their treason slew a royal man,  
They may be tricked and the same noose they rove  
Strangle themselves, even as Loxias spake,  
Apollo, Prince and Prophet ne’er found false.  
My guise a traveller, all my traps complete,  
With Pylades here I’ll to the palace-gates,  
As a friend of the house — trusty — oh, true as steel!  
And he and I will talk Parnassian,  
Mimic the parle of Phocis for the nonce.  
’Tis like enough their varlets will not smile  
A welcome, there’s such devilment within.  
No matter; we will wait; and passers-by  
Will say “How comes it? Aegisthus denies  
A stranger, if he be not gone abroad?”  
But once across the threshold of the court,  
And if I find him on my father’s throne,  
Or he come anon and look me in the face,  
Hell gapes for him, down drop his dastard eyes,  
Ere he can quaver “What’s your country?” I  
Will spit him on my sword a carcase for crows.  
And then Erinys, that stints not her cups,  
Shall quaff full healths of slaughter unallayed.  
Go, sister; have an eye to all within,  
That nothing in our business go agley.  
(To the Chorus) And see that ye offend not with your tongue;  
Speak, or say nothing, as occasion serves.  
(To Pylades) Hither to me: second me with thine eye;  
Put mettle in my heart and point my sword.

(Exeunt Orestes and Pylades.)

Chorus.  
> The tribes of earth are fierce and strong;

    And in the arms of ocean throng
    The monster enemies of man;

    From highest heaven’s noonday throne
    Flashes and falls the thunderstone
    On four-foot beast and feathered clan;

    Yea, and remember the hurricane
    With his cloak of wrath outblown.

    But the pride of man’s spirit what tongue can tell,
    Or woman’s unruly desires, that fell
    And hungry flock that feed on death?

    These lawless yearnings of the blood
    That master wanton womanhood
    Corrupt sworn troth with venal breath
    And break the bond that comforteth
    Man and beast in field and flood,

601-651
    Is that a fetch of thought beyond thy wing?
    Learn of the plot that ill-starred *Thestius* fired,
    And her own child’s untimely death conspired,
    Casting into the flame
    The rusty brand, of his nativity
    Prime comrade and coeval, numbering
    His minutes, from that hour when with a cry
    Forth from her womb he came
    To the last day appointed him to die.
    Or wist ye not of the girl-murderess
    Whose infamy yet lives in legend old?
    That for a carcanet of Cretan gold,
    King Minos’ gift, by foes
    Suborned, delivered up a well-loved head?
    Stealing from Nisus the immortal tress,
    What time—Oh, heart of dog!—in his noon-bed
    Breathing he lay in deep repose;
    And Hermes drew him down among the dead.
    But since old sorrows I recall
    That suck no balm from honeyed shower.
    Pour out to brim the cup of gall
    The sanguine wine of wedlock sour.
    Oh, bid them from thy hall
    And bid them from thy bower
    These dark imaginings of woman’s wit
    Against her warrior,
    Whose mien the foe with darkness smit,
    The majesty of war.
    Bright shines the hearth where no fierce passions throng
    And woman’s valour when she shrinks from wrong.
    So in the roll of antique time
    Her primacy black Lemnos bears;
    Her shame is cried in every clime;
    And all that horror dreads or dares
    Of that cursed Lemnian crime
    The sable likeness wears.
    She feels the ache of God’s most grievous ban:
    And her despised race
    Under the general scorn of man
    Is gone to their own place.
    That which displeases God none holds in awe;
    What cite I here that contradicts His law?
    There is a sword, whose biting thrust
    God’s Law drives home; plunged to the hilt
    Clean through the naked heart; for guilt
    Lies not down-trodden in the dust
    That men may trample as of right
    On all that’s holy in God’s sight.
    Now Justice’ anvil standeth fast;
    The Armourer, Doom, beats out her blade;
    Within is privily conveyed
    A Child that quits the bloody past;
    That true-born Child Erinys brings;
    Dark are her deep imaginings.

652-706
*Before the Palace Orestes and Pylades. Chorus.*
Or. Boy! Boy! Do you hear me knock? What, boy, I say!
    Who’s there? Open, if in Aegisthus’ halls
    Be welcome for a stranger.
Doorkeeper. Ay, have done!
    I hear ye. What’s your country, and whence come you?
Or. Announce me to your masters; I bring news
    Meant for their ear. And set about it quickly;
    For now the chariot of night comes on
    Darkling; it is the hour when travel casts
    Anchor in hostelries and roadside inns.
    Let one of charge and consequence come forth—
    Some worthy dame, or, stay, a man were best;
    For then nice manners need not overcast
    Frank speech; a man is to his brother man
    Open in converse, free without offence.
*Clytaemnestra appears at the Palace-door with Electra.*
Cl. Sirs, what’s your will? Here is such entertainment
    As fits my house; warm baths, an easy couch
    For tired limbs, and looks of honest welcome.
    But if there’s graver business to despatch,
    That’s men’s concern and they must hear of it.
Or. I come from Phocis; I am a Daulian;
    And on the road with mine own merchandise
    To Argos here, which is my journey’s end,
    A man to me unknown, as I to him,
    Met me, enquired my way and told me his;
    Strophius the Phocian, as appeared anon.
    “Sir” quoth he, “since you are travelling to Argos,
    Do me the service to inform his parents
    Their son Orestes is no more; forget not;
    And whether they decide to have him home,
    Or leave him ours for ever, bury him
    In his adopted land, bring word again.
    Meantime, his urn clips in its brazen round
    The ashes of a man right nobly mourned.”
    That was his message; whether chance-delivered
    To whom it concerns, who may herein command,
    I cannot tell; but they whose son he is
    Must surely be apprised of it.
Cl. Oh me!
    How are we stormed upon, broke, breached, despoiled!
    Unmastered curse of our unhappy house
    How wide thy range! Things out of reach thy bolt
    Brings down from far, and thou dost pluck from me
    To the last hair all, all, that I hold dear!
    And now Orestes; he that thought to plant
    His foot out of the mire of muddy death,
    The hope that physicked this debauch of blood,
    Pricked in thy roster answers to his name.
Or. Would I had better news to recommend me
    To my so honourable entertainers
    And grace their proffered welcome. What can warm
    The heart like kindness betwixt host and guest?
    And yet it had been wicked to my thinking
    Not to discharge an office laid on me
    Both by my pledged word and your courtesy.

707-759
Cl. Oh, not for that will we scant your deserts
    Or make you the less welcome to our house.
    Another had brought these tidings, if not thou.
    But it is time that day-long travellers
    Find full suppliance for the weary road.
*(To Electra)*
    Do you bestow him in the men’s guest-chambers,
    His company and all his retinue.
    Let them be treated as becomes our house;
    And be it done as you shall answer it.
*Electra, Orestes and Pylades enter the Palace.*
    These news we will impart unto our lord;
    And he and I, with help of our good friends,
    Take counsel touching this calamity.
*Clytaemnestra follows.*
Ch. Content! Content! Oh, when shall we,
    Dear’st handmaidens, full lustily
    Orestes’ triumph-song resound?
    Majestic earth! Thou cliff high-shored,
    Whose shadow sleeps on the longships’ lord,
    Give ear and send us present aid!
    Now is the hour of combat knolled,
    And Parley, with the tongue of gold,
    In guile unguessed moves darkly dight.
    And Nether Hermes cloaked in Night
    Shall watch this grim and bloody round
    Fought to the death with naked blade.
*The nurse is seen passing within.*
    The mischief works! His hand is in, our guest!
    Orestes’ nurse, all tear-bedabbled; Hist!
    Where steps *Cilissa* at the dark entry,
    Unsalaried Sorrow all her company?
*The nurse comes to the door.*
Nurse. Why, I am bidden by my lady run
    And fetch Aegisthus; she’ll have this confirmed;
    And man to man before it has time to cool
    They are to piece it out. Among her slaves
    She wears a knitted brow, but in her eyes
    Lurks laughter for this finish and fair close
    Of her much care; though ’tis of care compact
    For us, this traveller’s tale that cleft my heart.
    Ah, God, when he has heard it, probed and proved,
    How will his spirit dance for joy.
    Heigh-ho!
    Sorrows bygone, ill with worse ill confounding,
    The long, sick agonies of Atreus’ line,
    Did, in the coming of them, wring my heart.
    But none of them were half so grievous-heavy,
    And I found patience to bear them all.
    But my dear Orestes, spendings of my soul,
    Whom I took from his mother’s womb, nursed in my lap,
    And at his peevish piping broke my rest,
    And was so patient with him, trudge and drudge,
    And get no thanks. ’Tis but a witless thing,
    We have to nurse, no whelp more whimsical.
    It can’t speak plain, a weanling in long clothes;
    Woo’t drink? woo’t eat? make water, woo’t? God made
    The little belly a law unto itself.
    I would divine his wants, and oft as not
    Go wrong; and fall to washing dirty napkins,

759-808
    Laundress and nurse too, all for my sweet babe.
    Oh, turn and turn about, I plied both trades
    When I took Orestes from his father’s arms.
    Alack, and now they tell me he is dead;
    And I must get me to this dunghill dog
    Will take my tidings with a greedy ear.
Ch. How did she bid him come—in what array?
Nu. How? Say’t again: I do not understand thee.
Ch. Or with his bodyguard or unattended?
Nu. She bade him bring his Yeomen of the Guard.
Ch. Never deliver to the brute her message!
    Tell him to come alone, that he may hear
    From lips unawed; say, “quickly, cheerly come!”
    A tale that’s warped oft straightens in the telling!
Nu. Dost mean that these are welcome news to thee?
Ch. ’Tis an ill wind Zeus cannot turn to good.
Nu. Good? And our hope, our dear Orestes dead?
Ch. ’Twere no mean prophet could expound my text.
Nu. What mean’st? Hast aught that squares not with the tale?
Ch. Run! Take thy message, do as thou art bid:
    Safe in Heaven’s Hands is all that touches Heaven.
Nu. Well, I will suffer ye to have it so;
    And by the bounty of God may all end well.
*Exit NURSE*

### Chorus
    Father of Heaven, hear me in this hour;
    Raise up a fallen house; vouchsafe to bless
    Hearts that thirst and eyes that ache
    To see the Face of Soothfastness.
    Justice is all the plea I make;
    Uphold it with the Hand of Power.
    Oh, Zeus! Him in yon house of kings
    Prefer above his enemies,
    And he shall bring Thee free-will offerings,
    With triple lauds and threefold sacrifice.
    ’Tis but a Colt, bethink Thee, sired of One
    Beloved, that’s linked to the Iron Car of Woe!
    Collect those fiery paces! Mete
    The measure of his stride, that so
    With steady rhythm of galloping feet
    He break not till the course be run!
    Ye Dwellers of the inmost shrine, adorned
    With vessels of fine gold,
    Hearken! Ye Gods, that with us wept and mourned!
    Cancel with fresh Doom the blood of old
    Shed guiltily, till all’s undone!
    Nevermore, come Time, come Tide,
    In the House where Ye abide
    Grizzled Murder get a Son!
    God of the Grot, the vaulted Fane,
    Give these blind walls back their sight!
    Make them Man’s fair home again!
    Give them Freedom! Give them Light!

808-854
    Through this dark Veil, of Thy Grace,
    Make them show a shining face!
    Meet is it Maia’s child with subtlest craft
    Our dubious venture speed:
    Is none so deft, so nimble-light, to waft
    To port the hazard of a dextrous deed!
    He opens or shuts with “Yea” and “Nay”
    The gold of His hid Treasury;
    His Word is night to the seeing eye,
    And darkness in the broad noonday.
    Then, for deliverance from Despair,
    For a steady breeze and strong,
    We’ll harp and sing to a merry air
    The mumping witch-wives’ song:
    “The ship rides free; come, fill my lap;
    Put money in my purse;
    Largesse, fair Sirs, for your good hap
    And the boon of a broken Curse.”
    Thou to the deed march boldly on;
    And, when thou hear’st her cry, “My Son”
    Answer—“Not thine!”—and with one blow
    In blameless blood-guilt blot this Woe!
    On! Lest a word should win thee,
    A look break down thy guard;
    Harden the heart within thee
    As Perseus’ heart was hard!
    Make stern amends; relent not;
    Doth the wronged ghost forgive?
    Relax not—pause, repent not!
    They ask it that yet live!
    Strike, strike for Hate’s allaying,
    The House of Hate within,
    And with one sinless Slaying
    Slaughter the Seed of Sin!
*Enter Aegisthus.*
Aegisthus. I come not here unasked; a message reached me;
    I’m told there’s a strange rumour, certain men,
    Our guests, have brought, little to pleasure me;
    Orestes’ death. That were with a fresh load
    To chafe a sore that runs with fears unstaunched,
    And open bygone Murder’s aching scars.
    Shall I concede it true? Looks't forth clear-eyed?
    Or null and void as woman’s vain alarms;
    A flight of sparks that presently come to nought?
    What canst thou tell me that shall clear my doubt?
Ch. Only that we have heard it; go within:
    Question the strangers, man to man; there lies
    The marrow and pith of all the news e’er brought.
Ae. I’ll see this messenger and question him
    Again, if he was present at the death;
    Or vents a tale that hath no substance in it.
    They that would steal my wits first steal my eyes.
*Exit.*

855-901
Ch. Open my lips, order my prayers aright,
    O God above!
    Give them the strength, the breadth, the depth, the height,
    Of my exceeding love!
    Now on the soilure of one slaughterous sword
    Hangs Doom and Death
    For all the race of Agamemnon Lord;
    Or light and breath
    Of liberty on its keen edge shall glance;
    And, by those brandished fires,
    He shall possess a Kingdom’s governance
    And the glory of his sires.
    And, in this gest, a solitary knight,
    Two crafty foes grips he,
    Even Orestes, girt with a hero’s might;
    God give him Victory!
*A shriek is heard within the Palace.*
    Hark!—Hush!—which way
    Went the battle? What is Heaven’s will,
    O House, for thee this day?
    Let’s go aside that in this dark event
    It may be thought that we are innocent:
    What’s done is done; or be it good or ill.

### The Inner Court
Doorkeeper. Alas, my master! Oh, my lord, Aegisthus!
    A bloody, bloody end! Open! Be quick!
    Unbar the women’s gates! Muscle and brawn,
    Mettle of manly youth, we need you now,
    But not—God help us—for the helpless dead!
    Ho there, within! Oho!
    ’Tis shouting to the deaf; they are asleep;
    They heed me not! Where’s *Clytaemnestra*? What
    Doth she? Fore God, her neck is for the knife;
    Yea, by the hand of Judgement she must fall!
*Enter Clytaemnestra.*
Cl. What’s this? Why do you keep this bawling here?
Doorkeeper. The dead have come to life and slain the quick.
Cl. Ah, God! Ah, God! I read your riddle; we
    Are to perish even as we slaughtered him,
    Tricked and betrayed! Bring me a battle-axe!
    We’ll know if we mount high or fall full low;
    I touch the bound and bourn of all my woe.
*Enter Orestes, Pylades with him.*
Or. I am come to fetch thee; thy fellow hath his fill.
Cl. Oh—my dear’st love—Aegisthus—dead—dead—dead!
Or. Thou lov’st him? Good! Then thou shalt lie with him
    In’s grave; there thy false heart can never betray him.
Cl. Oh, hold thy hand! My child—my babe—look here!
    My breast; be tender to it; thy soft gums
    Did in thy drowse so often drink its milk.
Or. Pylades, what now? Shall I be tender to her?
Pylades. What then were Loxias’ prophesyings worth,

901-944
    His holy oracles? What oaths deep-sworn?
    Better the world thine enemy than Heaven!
Or. Thou art my better mind; thou counsellest well.
    Come here; I mean to slay thee where he lies,
    Whom thou didst count a better than my father.
    Sleep with him in death since thou lov’st him, and hat’st
    Him whom thou oughtest truly to have loved.
Cl. I nursed thee; I would fain grow old with thee!
Or. What? Kill my father and make thy home with me!
Cl. Destiny, dear child, was partner in my guilt.
Or. And Destiny accomplished thy doom.
Cl. Child, fear’st thou not a mother’s malison?
Or. Mother! You cast me out to misery!
Cl. Not cast thee out. They were our trusty friends!
Or. You basely sold me, born a free man’s son.
Cl. Where is the price that I received for thee?
Or. I am ashamed to tell thee openly.
Cl. Nay, do; but leave not out thy father’s sins!
Or. He wrought for thee while thou sat’st safe at home.
Cl. ’Tis nature, child; unmanned we ache and pine.
Or. They win ye bread that ye may eat at ease.
Cl. Is it even so? Child, wilt thou slay thy mother?
Or. Thou slay’st thyself, it is not I that kill thee.
Cl. Beware the ban-dogs of a mother’s fury!
Or. Except I do this how shall I ’scape my father’s?
Cl. I am like one that cries to the deaf grave!
Or. My father’s fate strikes thee with airs of death.
Cl. Thou art the aspic I brought forth and nursed!
Or. Thy fearful dream was prophet of thy woe,
    And thy foul sin pays forfeit in thy sorrow.
*Orestes drags in Clytaemnestra, followed by Pylades.*

### Chorus
    Oh, my heart’s heavy even for their fall.
    But since the gory edifice of woe
    Orestes copes and crowns; ’tis better so
    Than he be quenched who was the eye of all.
    There came on Priam’s sons at last
    Judgement and Retribution sore:
    There came two Lions wrapped in one tawny hide
    To Agamemnon’s house, yea, two-fold War.
    But, warned at Pytho, furious and fast,
    The banished man drove on amain, with God for Guide.
    Shout! Shout, Ho! with a jubilant rouse!
    Shout for my lord and my lord’s house
    Delivered from evil; from the twain that defiled
    His hearth and his substance squandered!

944-993
    Farewell, the lone, the trackless wild,
    The waste of Woe we wandered!
    Came He that loves the dark surprise
    Deep Retribution subtly planned;
    And Zeus’ own Daughter in this combat dire
    Her finger laid on the avenger’s hand;
    Men call her Justice—on her enemies
    She vents the blast of her consuming ire.
    The Voice of Loxias,
    In great Parnassus’ rocky cavern heard,
    The word of guile where no guile was,
    Though long deferred,
    Hath come to pass.
    The power of God can never pass away
    Because no evil thing is holp thereby;
    Meet is it, then, we worship and obey
    His governance Whose Hand sustains the starry sky.
    The dawn breaks fair; the night is spent;
    The bit is loosed and bridle unbound;
    Rise, walls! Rise, tower and battlement,
    Ye shall no more lie levelled to the ground.
    And it shall not be long
    Ere pardoning Time, the world’s great Hierarch,
    Shall pass with sound of charming song
    These portals dark,
    Absolve the wrong,
    And break the spell that bound them, utterly.
    Fortune shall throw a main and sweep the board;
    And we shall see her face and hear her cry;
    “Here will I make my home, to your fair house restored.”
*The scene discovers Orestes and Pylades standing over the dead bodies of Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus.*
Or. Behold the tyrants that oppressed your land,
    Slayers of fathers, plunderers of kings’ houses.
    But now they kept great state, seated on thrones;
    Yea, and, methinks, they yet lie lovingly
    In death, true honourers of their oath and bond.
    They sware that they would kill my father, sware
    To die together, and were not forsworn.
    Behold, ye judges of their heinous crimes,
    The thing they wrought, the links that bound my father,
    Gyves for his wrists and fetters for his feet.
    Shake it abroad, stand round me in a ring,
    Hang out these trappings, that a father’s eye
    Not mine, but he that watcheth all the world,
    Helios, may view my mother’s handiwork;
    Ay, and hereafter testify for me
    That justly I pursued even to the death
    My mother; I reck not Aegisthus’ end;
    For by the law the adulterer shall die.
    But she that hatched this horror for her lord,
    By whom she went with child, carried the load
    Of sometime love—but this tells you ’twas hate!

993-1040
    What? Had she conger’s teeth or adder’s fangs,
    She had corrupted where her tooth not bit,
    So absolute was she in iniquity.
    How shall I name this right and use fair words?
    Trap for a beast? Clout for a dead man’s feet?
    A towel is’t? Fore God, a trapper’s toil;
    A noose; a gown that trips the wearer up;
    Some rascal publican might get one like it,
    That robs his guests for a living; ay, with this,
    Put scores away and feel no cold fit after.
    I pray God one like her may never house
    With me—I’d liefer go childless to my grave.
Ch. Aiai! the woeful work! This hideous death
    Ends thee; thy pride and all thy passions cold;
    For him that yet must draw this lethal breath
    The flower of suffering begins to unfold.
Or. Was this her work or not? This proves it, this
    Robe, sullied with Aegisthus’ dagger-plunge.
    The tinct of murder, not the touch of Time
    Alone, hath—here and here—spoiled its rich brede.
    I’ll praise and mourn him now, I was not by
    To mourn and praise, with his death-robe before me.
    Sad act, sad end, thrice-wretched race, triumph
    No man need envy, soilure of my soul.
Ch. Time grants not our so perishable clay
    Bliss that endures or glory that shall last;
    Heaviness wears the instant hour away,
    Or it will come before the next be passed.
Or. Mark this: for I know not where it will end,
    Dragged like a driver of hot, headlong horses
    Quite from the track; beaten and borne afar
    By break-neck thoughts; fear at my heart, at stretch
    To strike up the grim tune, whereto ’twill dance.
    While I am in my senses, I protest
    I slew not, friends, my mother save with cause,
    My father’s blood upon her, and Heaven’s hate.
    I lay it on the charm that made me bold;
    On Pytho’s prophet, Loxias, that charged
    Me do the deed, and sware to hold me guiltless
    If done; if not, I sink the consequence:
    No bolt ere shot can hit that height of suffering.
    And now behold and see how I am furnished
    With branch and wreath, and, thus apparelled, go
    To earth’s great nombril-precincts, Loxias’ ground,
    And that famed fount of indestructible fire,
    Kin-murder’s outlaw; at no hearth but His
    Did Loxias bid me look for sanctuary.
    Hereafter let all Argives bear me out

1040-1076
    Not without strong compunction did I deal
    So ruefully with her that gave me life.
    I am a wanderer now, I have no friends,
    But live or die, this shall be told of me.
Ch. Thou hast done well; let words of evil note
    Be far from thy lips: give not ill fancies speech.
    Thou hast delivered all the land of Argos;
    Sawn off with one sword-sweep two dragon-heads.
Or. Ha! Ha!
    Women, they come about me—Gorgon shapes,
    Sheeted in grey—clasped round with scaly folds
    Of intertwisted snakes,—away! away!
Ch. True son to thy father, what fantastic
    Thoughts
    Are these? Stand fast! thou hast triumphed: fear for nought.
Or. These fearful torments are no phantasies;
    These are the leashed sleuth-hounds my mother slips!
Ch. Because the blood is fresh upon thy hands,
    Therefore this sudden frenzy rocks thy soul.
Or. Apollo! Prince! Look, look!—They come in crowds,
    And from their eyeballs blood drips horribly!
Ch. Haste thee where cleansing is! To Loxias!
    Hold fast to him and find deliverance!
Or. Ye see them not, but I see them; they turn
    Upon me! Hunt me forth! Away! Away!
*He rushes out.*
Ch. Fair Fortune go with him; God be his Guide;
    God keep him ceaselessly, and send him peace!
    There rose Three Winds and shook thee, sad palace where Power sat throned,
    And now the third bloweth over, the last that the first atoned.
    The First Wind came with crying of children slain long ago;
    Long, long was it a-dying, the Thyestean Woe!
    The next Wind swept with slaughter, but not by the foeman’s sword;
    All bloody was the water that laved Achaia’s lord.
    Now the Third Storm hath struck thee from the vast of an infinite gloom;
    Shall I hail thee Wind of Deliverance, or art thou a blast of doom?
    Oh, when will thy course be finished, when wilt thou change and cease,
    And the stormy heart of Havoc be lulled into lasting peace?
*Exeunt.*
