Inferred that Aristophanes died somewhere between 383 and 375 B.C.

*In the background are three houses: the central one that of Dicaeopolis, the other two those of Euripides and Lamachus. In the foreground is a rough representation of the Pnyx where Dicaeopolis is awaiting the opening of the Assembly.*

Dicaeopolis: What heaps of things have bitten
me to the heart!
A small few pleased me, very few, just four;
But those that vexed were sand-dune-hundredfold.
Let’s see: what pleased me, worth my gladfulness?
I know a thing it cheered my heart to see;
’Twas those five talents vomited up by Cleon.
At that I brightened; and I love the *Knights*
For that performance; ’twas of price to Hellas.
Then I’d a tragic sorrow, when I looked
With open mouth for Aeschylus, and lo,
The Crier called, “Bring on your play, Theognis.”
Judge what an icy shock that gave my heart!
Next; pleased I was when Moschus left, and in
Dexitheus came with his Boeotian song.
But oh this year I nearly cracked my neck,
When in slipped Chaeris for the Orthian nome.
But never yet since first I washed my face
Was I so bitten—in my brows with soap,
As now, when here’s the fixed Assembly Day,
And morning come, and no one in the Pnyx.
They’re in the Agora chattering, up and down
Scurrying to dodge the vermeil-tinctured cord. [^1]
Why even the Prytanes are not here! They’ll come
Long after time, elbowing each other, jostling
For the front bench, streaming down all together
You can’t think how. But as for making Peace
They do not care one jot. O City! City!
But I am always first of all to come,
And here I take my seat; then, all alone,
I pass the time complaining, yawning, stretching,
I fidget, write, twitch hairs out, do my sums,
Gaze fondly countrywards, longing for Peace,
Loathing the town, sick for my village-home,
Which never cried, “Come, buy my charcoal,” or
“My vinegar, my oil,” my anything;
But freely gave us all; no buy-word there.
So here I’m waiting, thoroughly prepared
To riot, wrangle, interrupt the speakers
Whene’er they speak of anything but Peace.
But here they come, our noon-day Prytanes!
Aye, there they go! I told you how ’twould be;
Every one jostling for the foremost place.

Crier: Move forward all,
Move up, within the consecrated line.

Amphitheus (*entering in a violent hurry*): Speaking
begun?

Crier: Who will address the meeting?

Amphitheus: I.

Crier: Who are you, sir?

Amphitheus: Amphitheus.

Crier: Not a man?

Amphitheus: No, an immortal. For the first Amphitheus
Was of Demeter and Triptolemus
The son: his son was Celeus; Celeus married
Phaenarete, who bare my sire Lycinus.
Hence I’m immortal; and the gods committed
To me alone the making peace with Sparta.
But, though immortal, I’ve no journey-money;
The Prytanes won’t provide it.

Crier: Archers, there!

Amphitheus (*as the archers seize him*): O help me, Celeus!
help, Triptolemus!

Dicaeopolis: Ye wrong the Assembly, Prytanes, ye do
wrong it,
Haling away a man who only wants
To give us Peace, and hanging up of shields.

*The archers release Amphitheus.*

Crier: St! Take your seat.

Dicaeopolis: By Apollo, no, not I,
Unless ye prytanize about the Peace.

Crier: O yes! The Ambassadors from the Great King!

*Enter, clad in gorgeous Oriental apparel, the envoys sent to the Persian court eleven years previously in the archonship of Euthymenes 437-6 B.C.*

Dicaeopolis: What King! I’m sick to death of embassies,
And all their peacocks and their impositions.

Crier: Keep silence!

Dicaeopolis: Hey! Ecbatana, here’s a show.

Ambassador: Ye sent us, envoys to the Great
King’s Court,
Receiving each two drachmas daily, when
Euthymenes was Archon.

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): O me, the drachmas!

Ambassador: And weary work we found it, sauntering on,
Supinely stretched in our luxurious litters
With awnings o’er us, through Caystrian plains.
’Twas a bad time.

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): Aye, the good time was mine,
Stretched in the litter on the ramparts here!

Ambassador: And oft they feted us, and we perforce
Out of their gold and crystal cups must drink
The pure sweet wine.

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): O Cranaean city, mark you
The insolent airs of these ambassadors?

Ambassador: For only those are there accounted men
Who drink the hardest, and who eat the most.

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): As here the most debauched and dissolute.

Ambassador: In the fourth year we reached the Great
King’s Court.
But he, with all his troops, had gone to sit
An eight-months’ session on the Golden Hills!

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): Pray, at what time did he conclude
his session?

Ambassador: At the full moon; and so came home again.
Then he too feted us, and set before us
Whole pot-baked oxen—

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): And who ever heard
Of pot-baked oxen? Out upon your lies!

Ambassador: And an enormous bird, three times the size
Of our Cleonymus: its name was—Gull.

Dicaeopolis (*aside*): That’s why you gulled us out of all
those drachmas!

Ambassador: And now we bring you Pseudo-Artabas [^2]
The Great King’s Eye.

Dicaeopolis: O how I wish some raven
Would come and strike out yours, the
Ambassador’s.

Crier: O yes! the Great King’s Eye!

*Enter Pseudo-Artabas.*

Dicaeopolis: O Heracles!
By Heaven, my man, you wear a war-ship look!
What! Do you round the point, and spy the
docks?
Is that an oar-pad underneath your eye?

Ambassador: Now tell the Athenians, Pseudo-Artabas,
What the Great King commissioned you to say.

Pseudo-Artabas: Ijisti boutti furbiss upde rotti. [^3]

Ambassador: Do you understand?

Dicaeopolis: By Apollo, no not I.

Ambassador: He says the King is going to send you gold.
(*to Pseudo-Artabas*) Be more distinct and clear
about the gold.

Pseudo-Artabas: No getti goldi, nincompoop lawny.

Dicaeopolis: Wow, but that’s clear enough!

Ambassador: What does he say?

Dicaeopolis: He says the Ionians must be nincompoops
If they’re expecting any gold from Persia.

Ambassador: No, no: he spoke of golden income-coupons.

Dicaeopolis: What income-coupons? You’re a great big
liar!
You, get away; I’ll test the man myself.

(*to Pseudo-Artabas*)
Now look at this (*showing his fist*): and answer
Yes, or No!
Or else I’ll dye you with a Sardian dye.
Does the Great King intend to send us gold?
(*Pseudo-Artabas nods dissent.*)
Then are our envoys here bamboozling us?
(*He nods assent.*)
These fellows nod in pure Hellenic style;
I do believe they come from hereabouts.
Aye, to be sure; why, one of these two eunuchs
Is Cleisthenes, Sibyrtius’s son!
O thou young shaver of the hot-souled rump,
With such a beard, thou monkey, dost thou come
Tricked out amongst us in a eunuch’s guise?
And who’s this other chap? Not Straton, surely?

Crier: St! Take your seat! O yes!
The Council ask the Great King’s Eye to dinner
At the Town Hall.

*Exit Ambassadors and Pseudo-Artabas.*

Dicaeopolis: Now is not that a throttler?
Here must I drudge at soldiering; while these
rogues,
The Town Hall door is never closed to them.
Now then, I’ll do a great and startling deed.
Amphitheus! Where’s Amphitheus?

Amphitheus: Here am I.

Dicaeopolis: Here be eight drachmas; take them; and
with all
The Lacedaemonians make a private peace
For me, my wife and children: none besides.

(*to the Prytanes and citizens*)
Stick to your embassies and befoolings, you.

*Exit Amphitheus.*

Crier: O yes! Theorus from Sitalces!

Theorus (*rising*): Here!

Dicaeopolis: O here’s another humbug introduced.

Theorus: We should not, sirs, have tarried long in
Thrace—

Dicaeopolis: But for the salary you kept on drawing.

Theorus: But for the storms, which covered Thrace
with snow
And froze the rivers. ’Twas about the season
At which Theognis was performing here.
I all that time was drinking with Sitalces;
A most prodigious Athens-lover he,
Yea such a true admirer, he would scribble
On every wall “My beautiful Athenians”!
His son, our newly-made Athenian, longed
To taste his Apaturian sausages,
And bade his father help his fatherland.
And he, with deep libations, vowed to help us
With such an host that every one would say,
“Heavens! what a swarm of locusts comes this
way!”

Dicaeopolis: Hang me, if I believe a single word
Of all that speech, except about the locusts.

Theorus: And here he sends you the most warlike
tribe
Of all in Thrace.

Dicaeopolis: Come, here’s proof positive.

Crier: The Thracians whom Theorus brought,
come forward!

Dicaeopolis: What the plague’s this?

Theorus: The Odomantian host.

Dicaeopolis: The Odomantians, pho! Hallo, look here.
Are Odomantians all equipped like this?

Theorus: Give them two drachmas each a day, and
these
Will targeteer Boeotia all to bits.

Dicaeopolis: Two drachmas for these scarecrows! Oh, our
tars,
Our noble tars, the safeguard of our state,
Well may they groan at this. O! Murder! O!
These Odomantian thieves have sacked my garlic.
Put down the garlic! drop it!

Theorus: You rapscallion,
How dare you touch them, when they’re garlic-
primed.

Dicaeopolis: O will you let them, Prytanes, use me thus,
Barbarians too, in this my fatherland?
But stop! I warn you not to hold the Assembly
About the Thracians’ pay. I tell you there’s
A portent come; I felt a drop of rain!

Crier: The Thracians are to go, and two days hence
Come here again. The Assembly is dissolved.

*Exeunt all but Dicaeopolis.*

Dicaeopolis: O me, the salad I have lost this day!
But here’s Amphitheus, back from Lacedaemon.
Well met, Amphitheus!

*Enter Amphitheus.*

Amphitheus: Not till I’ve done running.
I needs must flee the Acharnians, clean away.

Dicaeopolis: What mean you?

Amphitheus: I was bringing back in haste
The treaties, when some veterans smelt them out,
Acharnians, men of Marathon, hard in grain
As their own oak and maple, rough and tough;
And all at once they cried, “O villain, dare you
Bring treaties when our vineyards are cut down?”
Then in their lappets up they gathered stones;
I fled away: they followed roaring after.

Dicaeopolis: So let them roar. But have you got the
treaties?

Amphitheus: O yes, I have. Three samples; here they are.
These are the five-year treaties; take and taste
them.

Dicaeopolis: Pheugh!

Amphitheus: What’s the matter?

Dicaeopolis: I don’t like the things,
They smell of tar and naval preparations.

Amphitheus: Then taste the ten-year samples; here they are.

Dicaeopolis: These smell of embassies to all the states,
Urgent, as if the Allies are hanging back.

Amphitheus: Then here are treaties both by land and sea
For thirty years.

Dicaeopolis: O Feast of Dionysus!
These have a smell of nectar and ambrosia,
And never mind about the three days’ rations,
And in your mouth they say, “Go where you
please.”
These do I welcome, these I pour, and drain,
Nor care a hang about your old Acharnians.
But I, released from War and War’s alarms,
Will hold, within, the Rural Dionysia.

Amphitheus: And I will flee those peppery old Acharnians.

*Exeunt Dicaeopolis and Amphitheus.*
*Enter, running in pursuit of Amphitheus, twenty-four old Acharnians who constitute the chorus.*

Chorus: Here’s the trail; pursue, pursue him;
    follow, follow, every man;
    Question whosoever meets you
    whitherwards the fellow ran.
    Much it boots the state to catch him!
    (*to the audience*) O inform me, if ye know,
    Where the man who bears the treaties
    managed from my sight to go.
    Fled and gone! Disappears!
    O this weary weight of years!
    O were I now as spry
    As in youthful days gone by,
    When I stuck like a man
    To Phayllus as he ran,
    And achieved second place in the race,
    Though a great charcoal freight
    I was bearing on my head,—
    Not so light from my sight
    Had this treaty-bearer fled,
    Nor escaped with such ease from the chase.
    Now because my joints have stiffened,
    and my shins are young no more,
    And the legs of Lacrateides
    by old age are burdened sore,
    He’s escaped us! But we’ll follow:
    but he shall not boast that he
    Got away from us Acharnians,
    howsoever old we be.
    Who has dared, Father Zeus!
    Gods of heaven! to make a truce,
    Who has pledged faith with those
    Who are evermore my foes;
    Upon whom war I make
    For my ruined vineyard’s sake;
    And I ne’er from the strife will give o’er,
    No, I ne’er will forbear,
    Till I pierce them in return,
    Like a reed, sharply barbed
    Dagger-pointed, and they learn
    Not to tread down my vines any more.
    Now ’tis ours to seek the fellow,
    and Peltine-wards to look,
    And from land to land to chase him,
    till we bring the rogue to book.
    Never shall I tire of pelting,
    pelting him to death with stones.

Dicaeopolis (*within*): Keep ye all the holy silence!

Chorus: Hush! we’ve got him. Heard ye, comrades,
    “silence” called in solemn tones?
    This is he, the man we’re seeking.
    Stand aside, and in a trice
    He, methinks, will stand before us,
    coming out to sacrifice!

Dicaeopolis (*coming out, followed by his wife and daughter*): Keep ye all the holy silence!
Now, basket-bearer, go you on in front,
You Xanthias, hold the phallus-pole erect.

Wife: Set down the basket, girl: and we’ll begin.

Daughter: O mother, hand me here the gravy-spoon,
To ladle out the gravy o’er the cake.

Dicaeopolis: ’Tis well. Lord Dionysus, grant me now
To show the show and make the sacrifice
As thou would’st have me, I and all my house;
Then keep with joy the Rural Dionysia;
No more of soldiering now. And may this Peace
Of thirty summers answer to my hopes.

Wife: O daughter, bear the basket sweetly, sweet,
With savory-eating look. Happy the man,
Whoe’er he is, who weds thee and begets
Kittens as fair and saucy as thyself.
Move on! but heed lest any in the crowd
Should nibble off, unseen, thy bits of gold.

Dicaeopolis: O Xanthias, walk behind the basket-bearer,
Holding, you two, the phallus-pole erect.
And I’ll bring up the rear, and sing the hymn:
Wife, watch me from the roof. Now then, proceed.

(*singing*) O Phales, comrade revel-roaming
    Of Bacchus, wanderer of the gloaming,
    Of wives and boys the naughty lover,
    Here in my home I gladly greet ye,
    Six weary years of absence over;
    For I have made a private treaty
    And said good-bye to toils and fusses,
    And fights, and fighting Lamachuses.
    Far happier ’tis to me and sweeter,
    O Phales, Phales, some soft glade in,
    To woo the saucy, arch, deceiving,
    Young Thratta (Strymodorus’s maiden),
    As from my woodland fells I meet her
    Descending with my fagots laden,
    And catch her up, and ill entreat her,
    And make her pay the fine for thieving.
    O Phales, Phales, come and sup,
    And in the morn, to brace you up,
    Of Peace you’ll quaff a jovial cup;
    And mid the chimney sparks our useless shield
    we’ll hang.

Chorus: That’s the man who made the treaty;
    There he stands full in view;
    Pelt him, pelt him, pelt him, pelt him,
    Pelt him you! Pelt him you!

Dicaeopolis: Heracles! what ails the fellows?
Hang it all, ye’ll smash the pot!

Chorus: It is you we will smash with our
    stones, you detestable head.

Dicaeopolis: O most worshipful Acharnians,
why? what reason have ye got?

Chorus: Dare you ask? Traitor base!
    Dare you look me in the face?
    You who make, you alone,
    Private treaties of your own!
    Shameless heart! Shameless hand!
    Traitor to your fatherland!

Dicaeopolis: But ye know not why I did it:
hear me now the facts declare.

Chorus: Hear you? No! You’re to die;
    ’Neath a stony cairn to lie!

Dicaeopolis: Not, O not until ye’ve heard me;
worthy sirs, forbear, forbear!

Chorus: No delay! Thee to slay
    We’ll immediately begin.
    No debate! Thee we hate
    Worse than Cleon’s self, whose skin
    I’ll ere long cut to shoes
    For the worthy Knights to use.
    But from you, who made a treaty
    with the false Laconian crew,
    I will hear no long orations,
    I will surely punish you.

Dicaeopolis: Worthy fellows, for the moment
those Laconians pretermit;
’Tis a question of my treaty,
was I right in making it.

Chorus: Right to make it! when with Sparta
    no engagement sacred stands,
    Not the altar, not the oath-pledge,
    not the faith of clasped right hands!

Dicaeopolis: Yet I know that these our foemen,
who our bitter wrath excite,
Were not always wrong entirely,
nor ourselves entirely right.

Chorus: Not entirely, shameless rascal?
    Do you such opinions dare
    Openly to flaunt before me?
    Shall I then a traitor spare?

Dicaeopolis: Not entirely, not entirely!
I can prove by reasons strong
That in many points the Spartans
at our hands have suffered wrong.

Chorus: This is quite a heart-perplexing,
    terrible affair indeed,
    If you mean that you will venture
    for our enemies to plead.

Dicaeopolis: Aye, and if I plead not truly,
or the people doubt display,
On a chopping-block I’m willing,
whilst I speak, my head to lay.

Chorus: Why so slack, my fellow-burghers?
    Let us stone the naughty varlet,
    Let us scarify and shred him
    to an uniform of scarlet.

Dicaeopolis: What a red and dangerous ember
sparkled up within you then!
Won’t you hear me, won’t you hear me,
good Acharnians, worthy men?

Chorus: Never, never, will we hear you.

Dicaeopolis: That will cause me bitter woe.

Chorus: If I do, perdition seize me!

Dicaeopolis: O Acharnians, say not so.

Chorus: Know that you must die this instant.

Dicaeopolis: Then I’ll make you suffer too.
For my safety I’ve a hostage,
one that’s very dear to you.
Now I’ll bring him out and slay him;
you shall see your darling’s end.

*Dicaeopolis goes into the house and returns three lines later, carrying in one hand a hamper full of charcoal and in the other a drawn sword.*

Chorus: O Acharnian fellow-burghers,
    what can words like these portend
    To our noble band of brethren?
    Think you that the man can hold
    Any child of ours in durance?
    What can make him wax so bold?

Dicaeopolis: Now then pelt me; here’s the hostage!
I will slay and will not spare.
I shall speedily discover
which of you for charcoal care.

Chorus: Heaven preserve us! ’tis a scuttle,
    ’tis my fellow-burgher true!
    Never do the thing you mention:
    never do, O never do!

Dicaeopolis: Cry aloud! I’m going to slay him;
I shall neither hear nor heed.

Chorus: You will slay then this charcoal-adorer,
    its equal in years!

Dicaeopolis: Aye, for when I craved a hearing
you refused to hear me plead.

Chorus: Ah! but now! Now you may!
    Whatsoever suits you say.
    Say you love, say you prize,
    Our detested enemies.
    Ne’er will I faithless prove
    To the scuttle which I love.

Dicaeopolis: Well then first, the stones you gathered,
throw them out upon the ground.

Chorus: Out they go! All my hoard!
    Prithee, lay aside the sword.

Dicaeopolis: But I fear that in your lappets
other missiles may be found.

Chorus: All are gone! Everyone!
    See my garment shaken wide!
    Don’t evade promise made.
    Lay, O lay the sword aside.
    Here’s my robe shaken out,
    As I twist and twirl about.

Dicaeopolis: You would then, would you, shake your
cries aloft,
And this Parnesian charcoal all but died,
Slain by the madness of its fellow-burghers.
And in its fright this scuttle, cuttle-wise,
Voided its inky blackness on my clothes.
Alas that men should carry hearts as sour
As unripe grapes, to pelt and roar, nor hear
A tempered statement mingled half and half;
Not though I’m willing o’er a chopping-block
To say my say for Lacedaemon’s folk.
And yet I love, be sure, my own dear life.

*Dicaeopolis exits to house.*

Chorus: O why not bring the block
    out of doors without delay,
    And speak the mighty speech
    which you think will win the day?
    For really I’ve a longing
    to hear what you will say!
    So in the fashion you yourself prescribed,
    Place here the chopping-block and start your
    speech.

Dicaeopolis (*re-entering, with a block*): Well look and see,
the chopping-block is here,
And I’m to speak, poor little friendless I.
Still never mind; I won’t enshield myself,
I’ll speak my mind for Lacedaemon’s folk.
And yet I fear; for well I know the moods
Of our good country people, how they love
To hear the City and themselves bepraised
By some intriguing humbug, right or wrong.
Nor ever dream they are being bought and sold.
And well I know the minds of those old men
Looking for nothing but a verdict-bite.
Aye and I know what I myself endured
At Cleon’s hands for last year’s *Comedy*.
How to the Council-house he haled me off,
And slanged, and lied, and slandered, and
betongued me,
Roaring Cycloborus-wise; till I well nigh
Was done to death, bemiryslushified.
Now therefore suffer me, before I start,
To dress me up the loathliest way I can.

Chorus: O why keep putting off with that shilly-
    shally air?
    Hieronymus may lend you, for anything I care,
    The shaggy “*Cap of Darkness*” from his tangle-
    matted hair.
    Then open all the wiles of Sisyphus,
    Since this encounter will not brook delay.

Dicaeopolis: Now must my heart be strong, and I depart
To find Euripides. Boy! Ho there, boy!

Cephisophon: Who calls me?

Dicaeopolis: Is Euripides within?

Cephisophon: Within and not within, if you conceive me.

Dicaeopolis: Within and not within?

Cephisophon: ’Tis even so.
His mind, without, is culling flowers of song,
But he, within, is sitting up aloft
Writing a play.

Dicaeopolis: O lucky, lucky poet,
Whose very servant says such clever things!
But call him.

Cephisophon: But it can’t be done.

Dicaeopolis: But still . . . !
For go I won’t. I’ll hammer at the door.
Euripides, my sweet one!
O if you ever hearkened, hearken now.
’Tis I, Cholleidian Dicaeopolis.

Euripides: But I’ve no time.

Dicaeopolis: But pivot. [^4]

Euripides: But it can’t be done.

Dicaeopolis: But still . . . !

Euripides: Well then, I’ll pivot, but I can’t come down.

Dicaeopolis: Euripides!

*The eccyclema turns.*

Euripides: Aye.

Dicaeopolis: Why do you write up there,
And not down here? That’s why you make lame
heroes.
And wherefore sit you robed in tragic rags,
A pitiful garb? That’s why you make them
beggars.
But by your knees, Euripides, I pray,
Lend me some rags from that old play of yours;
For to the Chorus I to-day must speak
A lengthy speech; and if I fail, ’tis death.

Euripides: Rags! Rags! what rags? Mean you the rags
wherein
This poor old Oeneus came upon the stage?

Dicaeopolis: Not Oeneus, no; a wretcheder man than he.

Euripides: Those that blind Phoenix wore?

Dicaeopolis: Not Phoenix, no;
Some other man still wretcheder than Phoenix.

Euripides: What shreds of raiment can the fellow mean?
Can it be those of beggarly Philoctetes?

Dicaeopolis: One far, far, far, more beggarly than he.

Euripides: Can it be then the loathly gaberdine
Wherein the lame Bellerophon was clad?

Dicaeopolis: Bellerophon? no; yet mine too limped and
begged,
A terrible chap to talk.

Euripides: I know the man.
The Mysian Telephus.

Dicaeopolis: Telephus it is!
Lend me, I pray, that hero’s swaddling-clothes.

Euripides: Boy, fetch him out the rags of Telephus.
They lie above the Thyesteian rags,
’Twixt those and Ino’s.

Cephisophon (*to Dicaeopolis*): Take them; here they are.

Dicaeopolis (*holding up the tattered garment against the light*):
Lord Zeus, whose eyes can pierce through
everywhere,
Let me be dressed the loathliest way I can.
Euripides, you have freely given the rags,
Now give, I pray you, what pertains to these,
The Mysian cap to set upon my head.
For I’ve to-day to act a beggar’s part,
To be myself, yet not to seem myself;
The audience there will know me, who I am,
Whilst all the Chorus stand like idiots by,
The while I fillip them with cunning words.

Euripides: Take it; you subtly plan ingenious schemes.

Dicaeopolis: To thee, good luck; to Telephus—what I
wish him!
Yah! why I’m full of cunning words already.
But now, methinks, I need a beggar’s staff.

Euripides: Take this, and get thee from the marble
halls.

Dicaeopolis: O Soul, thou seest me from the mansion
thrust,
Still wanting many a boon. Now in thy prayer
Be close and instant. Give, Euripides,
A little basket with a hole burnt through it.

Euripides: What need you, hapless one, of this poor
wicker?

Dicaeopolis: No need perchance; but O I want it so.

Euripides: Know that you’re wearisome, and get you
gone.

Dicaeopolis: Alas! Heaven bless you, as it blessed your
mother.

Euripides: Leave me in peace.

Dicaeopolis: Just one thing more, but one,
A little tankard with a broken rim.

Euripides: Here. Now be off. You trouble us; begone.

Dicaeopolis: You know not yet what ill you do yourself.
Sweet, dear Euripides, but one thing more,
Give me a little pitcher, plugged with sponge.

Euripides: Fellow, you’re taking the whole tragedy.
Here, take it and begone.

Dicaeopolis: I’m going now.
And yet! there’s one thing more, which if I get not
I’m ruined. Sweetest, best Euripides,
With this I’ll go, and never come again;
Give me some withered leaves to fill my basket.

Euripides: You’ll slay me! Here! My plays are
disappearing.

Dicaeopolis: Enough! I go. Too troublesome by far
Am I, not witting that the chieftains hate me!
Good Heavens! I’m ruined. I had clean forgotten
The thing whereon my whole success depends.
My own Euripides, my best and sweetest,
Perdition seize me if I ask aught else
Save this one thing, this only, only this,
Give me some chervil, borrowing from your
mother.

Euripides: The man insults us. Shut the palace up.

*Here Euripides is wheeled in again, and Dicaeopolis advances to the block to make his speech.*

Dicaeopolis: O Soul, without our chervil we must go.
Knowest thou the perilous strife thou hast to
strive,
Speaking in favour of Laconian men?
On, on, my Soul! Here is the line. How? What?
Swallow Euripides, and yet not budge?
Oh, good! Advance, O long-enduring heart,
Go thither, lay thine head upon the block,
And say whatever to thyself seems good.
Take courage! Forward! March! O well done,
heart!

Chorus: What will you say? What will you do? Man,
    is it true
    You are made up of iron and of shamelessness too?
    You who will, one against us all, debate,
    Offering your neck a hostage to the State!
    Nought does he fear.
    Since you will have it so, speak, we will hear.

Dicaeopolis: Bear me no grudge, spectators, if, a beggar,

I dare to speak before the Athenian people
About the city in a comic play.
For what is true even comedy can tell.
And I shall utter startling things but true.
Nor now can Cleon slander me because,
With strangers present, I defame the State.
’Tis the Lenaea, and we’re all alone;
No strangers yet have come; nor from the states
Have yet arrived the tribute and allies.
We’re quite alone clean-winnowed; for I count
Our alien residents the civic bran.
The Lacedaemonians I detest entirely;
And may Poseidon, Lord of Taenarum,
Shake all their houses down about their ears;
For I, like you, have had my vines cut down.
But after all— for none but friends are here —
Why the Laconians do we blame for this?
For men of ours, I do not say the State,
Remember this, I do not say the State,
But worthless fellows of a worthless stamp,
Ill-coined, ill-minted, spurious little chaps,
Kept on denouncing Megara’s little coats.
And if a cucumber or hare they saw,
Or sucking-pig, or garlic, or lump-salt,
All were Megarian, and were sold off-hand.
Still these were trifles, and our country’s way.
But some young tipsy *cottabus*-players went
And stole from Megara-town the fair Simaetha.
Then the Megarians, garlicked with the smart,
Stole, in return, two of Aspasia’s hussies.
From these three Wantons o’er the *Hellenic* race
Burst forth the first beginnings of the War.
For then, in wrath, the Olympian Pericles
Thundered and lightened, and confounded *Hellas*,
Enacting laws which ran like drinking-songs.
> “That the Megarians presently depart
> From earth and sea, the mainland, and the mart.”
Then the Megarians, slowly famishing,
Besought their Spartan friends to get the Law
Of the three Wantons cancelled and withdrawn.
And oft they asked us, but we yielded not.
Then followed instantly the clash of shields.
Ye’ll say “They should not”; but what should
they, then?
Come now, had some Laconian, sailing out,
Denounced and sold a small Seriphian dog,
Would you have sat unmoved? Far, far from that!
Ye would have launched three hundred ships of
war,
And all the City had at once been full
Of shouting troops, of fuss with *trierarchs*,
Of paying wages, gilding Pallases,
Of rations measured, roaring colonnades,
Of wineskins, oarloops, bargaining for casks,
Of nets of onions, olives, garlic-heads,
Of chaplets, pilchards, flute-girls, and black eyes.
And all the arsenal had rung with noise
Of oar-spars planed, pegs hammered, oarloops
fitted,
Of boatswains’ calls, and flutes, and trills, and
whistles.
This had ye done; and shall not *Telephus*,

556-598

Think we, do this? we’ve got no brains at all.
**Semi-Chorus I.** Aye, say you so, you rascally
villain you?
And this from you, a beggar? Dare you blame us?
Because perchance, we’ve got informers here?
**Semi-Chorus II.** Aye, by Poseidon, every word he
says
Is true and right; he tells no lies at all.
**S.C. I.** True or untrue, is he the man to say it?
I’ll pay him out, though, for his insolent speech.
**S.C. II.** Whither away? I pray you stay. If him
you hurt,
You’ll find your own self hoisted up directly.

A scuffle takes place in the *orchestra*, in which
the leader of the first semichorus is worsted.

**S.C. I.** Lamachus! Help! with thy glances of lightning;
Terrible-crested, appear in thy pride,
Come, O Lamachus, tribesman and friend to us;
Is there a stormer of cities beside?
Is there a captain? O come ye in haste,
Help me, O help! I am caught by the waist.

Enter Lamachus.

**Lamachus.** Whence came the cry of battle to my
ears?
Where shall I charge? where cast the battle-din?
Who roused the sleeping Gorgon from its case?
**Di.** O Lamachus hero, O those crests and
cohorts!
**S.C. I.** O Lamachus, here has this fellow been
With frothy words abusing all the State.
**La.** You dare, you beggar, say such things as
those?
**Di.** O Lamachus hero, grant me pardon true
If I, a beggar, spake or chattered aught.
**La.** What said you? Hey?
**Di.** I can’t remember yet.
I get so dizzy at the sight of arms.
I pray you lay that terrible shield aside.
**La.** There then.
**Di.** Now set it upside down before me.
**La.** ’Tis done.
**Di.** Now give me from your crest that plume.
**La.** Here; take the feather.
**Di.** Now then, hold my head,
And let me vomit. I so loathe those crests.
**La.** What! use my feather, rogue, to make you
vomit?
**Di.** A feather is it, Lamachus? Pray what bird
Produced it? Is it a Great *Bustard’s* plume?
**La.** Death and Destruction!
**Di.** No, no, Lamachus.
That’s not for strength like yours. If strong you
are
Why don’t you circumcise me? You’re well armed.
**La.** What! you, a beggar, beard the general so?
**Di.** A beggar am I, Lamachus?
**La.** What else?
**Di.** An honest townsman, not an office-seeker,
Since war began, an active-service-seeker,
But you’re, since war began, a full-pay-seeker.
**La.** The people chose me —

598-638

**Di.** Aye, three cuckoo-birds.
That’s what I loathe; that’s why I made my treaty.
When grey-haired veterans in the ranks I saw,
And boys like you, paltry malingering boys,
Off, some to Thrace— their daily pay three
drachmas—
Phaenippuses, Hipparchid-reprobatians,
And some with Chares, to Chaonia some,
Gereto-Theodores, Diomi-rogues, and some
To Camarina, Gela, and Gryneia.
**La.** The people chose them —
**Di.** And how comes it, pray,
That you are always in receipt of pay,
And these are never? Come, Marilades,
You are old and grey; when have you served as
envoy?
Never! Yet he’s a steady, active man.
Well then, Euphorides, Pyronides, Dracullus,
Have you Ecbatana or Chaonia seen?
Never! But Coesyra's son and Lamachus,
They have; to whom, for debts and calls unpaid,
Their friends but now, like people throwing out
Their slops at eve, were crying “Stand away!”
**La.** O me! Democracy! can this be borne?
**Di.** No, not if Lamachus receive no pay.
**La.** But I with all the Peloponnesian folk
Will always fight, and vex them every way,
By land, by sea, with all my might and main.

Exit.

**Di.** And I to all the Peloponnesian folk,
Megarians and Boeotians, give full leave
To trade with me; but not to Lamachus.

Exit.

## Chorus

The man has the best of the wordy debate, and the
hearts of the people is winning
To his plea for the truce. Now doff we our robes,
our own *anapaestics* beginning.
Since first to exhibit his plays he began,
our chorus-instructor has never
Come forth to confess in this public address
how tactful he is and how clever.
But now that he knows he is slandered by foes
before Athens so quick to assent,
Pretending he jeers our City and sneers
at the people with evil intent,
He is ready and fain his cause to maintain
before Athens so quick to repent.
Let honour and praise be the guerdon, he says,
of the poet whose satire has stayed you
From believing the orators’ novel conceits
wherewith they cajoled and betrayed you:
Who bids you despise adulation and lies
nor be citizens Vacant and Vain.
For before, when an embassy came from the states
intriguing your favour to gain,
And called you the town of the *violet crown*,
so grand and exalted ye grew,
That at once on your tiptails erect ye would sit,
those crowns were so pleasant to you.

639-675

And then, if they added the *shiny*, they got
whatever they asked for their praises,
Though apter, I ween, for an oily sardine
than for you and your City the phrase is.
By this he’s a true benefactor to you,
and by showing with humour dramatic
The way that our wise democratic allies
are ruled by our State democratic.
And therefore their people will come oversea,
their tribute to bring to the City,
Consumed with desire to behold and admire
the poet so fearless and witty,
Who dared in the presence of Athens to speak
the thing that is rightful and true.
And truly the fame of his prowess, by this,
has been bruited the universe through,
When the Sovereign of Persia, desiring to test
what the end of our warfare will be,
Inquired of the Spartan ambassadors, first,
which nation is queen of the sea,
And next, which the wonderful Poet has got,
as its stern and unsparing adviser;
For those who are lashed by his satire, he said,
must surely be better and wiser,
And they’ll in the war be the stronger by far,
enjoying his counsel and skill.
And therefore the Spartans approach you to-day
with proffers of Peace and Goodwill,
Just asking indeed that *Aegina* ye cede;
and naught do they care for the isle,
But you of the Poet who serves you so well
they fain would despoil and beguile.
But be you on your guard nor surrender the bard;
for his Art shall be righteous and true.
Rare blessings and great will he work for the State,
rare happiness shower upon you;
Not fawning, or bribing, or striving to cheat
with an empty unprincipled jest;
Not seeking your favour to curry or nurse,
but teaching the things that are best.
And therefore I say to the people to-day,
Let Cleon the worst of his villainies try,
His anger I fear not, his threats I defy!
For Honour and Right beside me will fight,
And never shall I
In aught that relates to the city be found
Such a craven as he, such a profligate hound.
O Muse, fiery-flashing, with temper of flame,
energetic, Acharnian, come to my gaze,
Like the wild spark that leaps from the evergreen
oak,
when its red-glowing charcoal is fanned to a blaze,
And the small fish are lying all in order for the
frying;
And some are mixing *Thasian*, richly dight, shiny-bright,
And some dip the small fish therein;
Come, fiery-flashing Maid, to thy fellow-burgher’s
aid,
With exactly such a song, so glowing and so strong,

675-708

To our old rustic melodies akin.
We the veterans blame the City.
Is it meet and right that we,
Who of old, in manhood’s vigour,
fought your battles on the sea,
Should in age be left untended,
yea exposed to shame and ill?
Is it right to let the youngsters
air their pert forensic skill,
Grappling us with writs and warrants,
holding up our age to scorn?
We who now have lost our music,
feeble nothings, dull, forlorn,
We whose only “Safe Poseidon”
is the staff we lean upon,
There we stand, decayed and muttering,
hard beside the Court-house Stone,
Naught discerning all around us
save the darkness of our case.
Comes the youngster, who has compassed
for himself the accuser’s place,
Slings his tight and nipping phrases,
tackling us with legal scraps,
Pulls us up and cross-examines,
setting little verbal traps,
Rends and rattles old *Tithonus*
till the man is dazed and blind;
Till with toothless gums he mumbles,
then departs condemned and fined;
Sobbing, weeping, as he passes,
to his friends he murmurs low,
“All I’ve saved to buy a coffin
now to pay the fine must go.”
How can it be seemly, a grey-headed man by the
water-clock’s stream to decoy and to slay,
Who of old, young and bold, laboured hard for the
State, who would wipe off his sweat and return
to the fray?
At *Marathon* arrayed, to the battle-shock we ran,
And our mettle we displayed, foot to foot, man to
man,
and our name and our fame shall not die.
Aye in youth we were Pursuers on the *Marathonian*
plain,
But in age Pursuers vex us, and our best defence
is vain.
To this what can *Marpsias* reply?
Oh, *Thucydides* to witness,
bowed with age, in sore distress,
Feebly struggling in the clutches
of that *Scythian* wilderness
Fluent glib *Cephisodemus* —
Oh the sorrowful display!
I myself was moved with pity,
yea and wiped a tear away,
Grieved at heart the gallant veteran
by an archer mauled to view;
Him who, were he, by *Demeter*,
that *Thucydides* we knew,
Would have stood no airs or nonsense
from the Goddess Travel-sore, [^1]
Would have thrown, the mighty wrestler,
ten *Evathluses* or more,
Shouted down three thousand archers
with his accents of command,
Shot his own accuser’s kinsmen
in their *Scythian* fatherland.
Nay, but if ye will not leave us
to our hardly earned repose,
Sort the writs, divide the actions,
separating these from those;
Who assails the old and toothless
should be old and toothless too;
For a youngster, wantons, gabblers,
Cleinias’ son [^2] the trick may do.
So for future fines and exiles,
fair and square the balance hold,
Let the youngster sue the youngster,
and the old man sue the old.

[^1]: Demeter.
[^2]: Alcibiades.

Enter Dicaeopolis.
**Di.** These are the boundaries of my market-place;
In this new scene what was the *Pnyx* somehow
becomes the market-place of Dicaeopolis.
And here may all the Peloponnesian folk,
Megarians and Boeotians, freely trade
Selling to me, but Lamachus may not.
And these three thongs, of Leprous make, I set
As market-clerks, elected by the lot.
Within these bounds may no informer come,
Or any other sycophant man.
But I’ll go fetch the Treaty-Pillar here,
And set it up in some conspicuous place.

Exit Dicaeopolis, and a half-starved Megarian
enters, followed by two little girls whom he
bids “mount” the stage from the side-scenes.

**Megarian.** Gude day, Athenian market, Megara's
luve!
By Frien'ly Zeus, I’ve miss't ye like my mither.
But ye, puir bairnies o' a waefu' father,
Speel up, ye’ll aiblins fin' a barley-bannock.
Now listen, bairns; atten' wi' a' yere — painch;
Whilk wad ye liefer, to be sellt or clemmed?
**Girls.** Liefer be sellt! Liefer be sellt!

As to gie aught for you, a sicker skaith?

An' shaw yeresells a decent grumphie's weans.
For gin' I tak' ye hame unsellt, by Hairmes
Ye'll thole the warst extremities o' clemmin'.
Ne'est, pit thir lang pig-snowties owre yere nebs,
An' stech yere bodies in this sackie. Sae.
An' min' ye grunt an' grane an' g-r-r awa',
An' mak' the skirls o' little Mystery piggies.
Mysel' will ca' for Dicaeopolis.

749-798

Are ye for buyin' onie pigs the day?

Enter Dicaeopolis.

**Di.** How now, Megarian?
**Meg.** Come to niffer, guidman.
**Di.** How fare ye all?
**Meg.** A' greetin' by the fire.
**Di.** And very jolly too if there’s a piper.
What do your people do besides?
**Meg.** Sae, sae.
For when I cam' frae Megara toun the morn,
Our Lairds o' Council were in gran' debate
How we might quickliest perish, but an' ben.
**Di.** So ye’ll lose all your troubles.
**Meg.** What for no?
**Di.** What else at Megara? What’s the price of
wheat?
**Meg.** Och! high eneugh: high as the Gudes, an'
higher.
**Di.** Got any salt?
**Meg.** Ye're maisters o' our saut.
**Di.** Or garlic?
**Meg.** Garlic, quotha! when yeresells,
Makin' yere raids like onie swarm o' mice,
Howkit up a' the rooties wi' a stak'.
**Di.** What have you got then?
**Meg.** Mystery piggies, I.
**Di.** That’s good; let’s see them.
**Meg.** Hae! They're bonnie piggies.
Lift it, an't please you; 'tis sae sleek an' bonnie.
**Di.** What on earth’s this?
**Meg.** A piggie that, by Zeus.
**Di.** A pig! What sort of pig?
**Meg.** A Megara piggie.
What! no a piggie that?
**Di.** It doesn’t seem so.
**Meg.** 'Tis awfu'! Och the disbelievin' carle!
Uphaudin' she’s na piggie! Will ye wad,
My cantie frien', a pinch o' thymy saut
She’s no a piggie in the Hellenian use?
**Di.** A human being’s —
**Meg.** Weel, by Diodes,
She’s mine; wha's piggie did ye think she was?
Mon? wad ye hear them skirlin'?
**Di.** By the Powers,
I would indeed.
**Meg.** Now piggies, skirl awa'.
Ye winna? winna skirl, ye graceless hizzies?
By Hairmes then I'se tak' ye hame again.
**Girls.** Wee! wee! wee!
**Meg.** This no a piggie?
**Di.** Faith, it seems so now,
But 'twon't remain so for five years I’m thinking.
**Meg.** Trowth, tak' my word for't, she’ll be like
her mither.
**Di.** But she’s no good for offerings.
**Meg.** What for no?
What for nae guid for offerins?
**Di.** She’s no tail.
**Meg.** Aweel, the puir wee thing, she’s owre young
yet.
But when she’s auld, she’ll have a gawcie tail.
But wad ye rear them, here’s a bonnie piggie!

799-834

**Di.** Why she’s the staring image of the other.
**Meg.** They're o' ane father an' ane mither, baith.
But bide a wee, an' when she’s fat an' curlie
She’ll be an offerin' gran' for *Aphrodite*.
**Di.** A pig’s no sacrifice for *Aphrodite*.
**Meg.** What, no for Her! Mon, for hirsel' the lane.
Why there’s nae flesh sae tastie as the flesh
O' thae sma piggies, roastit on a spit.
**Di.** But can they feed without their mother yet?
**Meg.** Poteidan, yes! withouten father too.
**Di.** What will they eat most freely?
**Meg.** Aught ye gie them.
But spier yoursel'.
**Di.** Hey, piggy, piggy!
**1st. Girl.** Wee!
**Di.** Do you like pease, you piggy?
**1st. Girl.** Wee, wee, wee!
**Di.** What, and Phibalean figs as well?
**1st. Girl.** Wee, wee!
**Di.** What, and you other piggy?
**2nd. Girl.** Wee, wee, wee!
**Di.** Eh, but ye're squealing bravely for the figs.
Bring out some figs here, one of you within,
For these small piggies. Will they eat them? Yah!
Worshipful *Heracles*! how they are gobbling now.
Whence come the pigs? They seem to me Aetolian.
**Meg.** Na, na; they haena eaten a' thae figs.
See here; here’s ane I pickit up mysel'.
**Di.** Upon my word, they are jolly little beasts.
What shall I give you for the pair? let’s hear.
**Meg.** Gie me for ane a tie o' garlic, will ye,
An' for the tither half a peck o' saut.
**Di.** I’ll buy them: stay you here awhile.

Exit.

**Meg.** Aye, aye.
Traffickin' Hairmes, wad that I could swap
Baith wife an' mither on sic terms as thae.

Enter Informer.

**Informer.** Man! who are you?
**Meg.** Ane Megara piggie-seller.
**In.** Then I’ll denounce your goods and you
yourself
As enemies!
**Meg.** Hech, here it comes again,
The vera primal source of a' our wae.
**In.** You’ll Megarize to your cost. Let go the
sack.
**Meg.** Dicaeopolis! Dicaeopolis! Here’s a chiel
Denouncin' me.
**Di.** (re-entering) Where is he? Market-clerks,
Why don’t you keep these sycophants away?
What! show him up without a lantern-wick?
**In.** Not show our enemies up?
**Di.** You had better not.
Get out, and do your showing other-where.

Exit INFORMER.

**Meg.** The pest thae birkies are in Athens toun!
**Di.** Well never mind, Megarian, take the things,
Garlic and salt, for which you sold the pigs.
Farewell!
**Meg.** That’s na our way in Megara toun.
**Di.** Then on my head the officious wish return!
**Meg.** O piggies, try withouten father now

835-876

To eat wi' saut yere bannock, an' ye git ane.

Exeunt Dicaeopolis and Megarian.

## Chorus

A happy lot the man has got:
his scheme devised with wondrous art
Proceeds and prospers as you see;
and now he’ll sit in his private Mart
The fruit of his bold design to reap.
And O if a *Ctesias* come this way,
Or other informers vex us, they
Will soon for their trespass weep.
No sneak shall grieve you buying first
the fish you wanted to possess,
No *Prepis* on your dainty robes
wipe off his utter loathsomeness.
You’ll no *Cleonymus* jostle there;
But all unsoiled through the Mart you’ll go,
And no Hyperbolus work you woe
With writs enough and to spare.
Never within these bounds shall walk
the little fop we all despise,
The young *Cratinus* neatly shorn
with single razor wanton-wise,
That *Artemon*-engineer of ill,
Whose father sprang from an old he-goat,
And father and son, as ye all may note,
Are rank with its fragrance still.
No *Pauson*, scurvy knave, shall here
insult you in the market-place,
No vile *Lysistratus*, to all
*Cholargian* folk a dire disgrace,
That deep-dyed sinner, that low buffoon.
Who always shivers and hungers sore
Full thirty days, or it may be more,
In every course of the moon.

Enter Boeotian, with slave and musicians.

**Boeotian.** Hech sirs, my shouther's sair, wat
*Heracles*!
Ismenias lad, pit doon thae pennyroyal
Wi' tentie care. Pipers wha cam' frae Thaibes
Blaw oop the auld tyke’s hurdies wi' the banes.
**Di.** Hang you! shut up! Off from my doors, you
wasps!
Whence flew these curst *Chaeridian* bumble-drones
Here, to my door? Get to the ravens! Hence!

Exeunt musicians.

**Bo.** An' recht ye are, by *Iolaus*, stranger.
They've blawn behint me a' the wa' frae Thaibes,
An' danged the blossom aff my pennyroyal.
But buy, an't please you, onie thing I’ve got,
Some o' thae deckin' or thae four-winged gear.
**Di.** O welcome, dear Boeotian muffin-eater,
What have you there?
**Bo.** A' that Boeotia gies us
Mats, dittany, pennyroyal, lantern-wicks,
An' dooks, an' kaes, an' francolins, an' coots,
Plivers an' divers.

876-922

**Di.** Eh? Why then, methinks,
You’ve brought fowl weather to my market-place.
**Bo.** Aye, an' I’m bringin' maukins, geese, an' tods.
Easels an' weasels, urchins, moles, an' cats,
An' otters too, an' eels frae Loch Copais'.
**Di.** O man, to men their daintiest morsel
bringing,
Let me salute the eels, if eels you bring.
**Bo.** Primest o' Loch Copais' fifty dochters
Come oot o' that; an' mak' the stranger welcome.
**Di.** O loved, and lost, and longed for, thou art
come,
A presence grateful to the Comic choirs,
And dear to *Morychus*. Bring me out at once,
O kitchen-knaves, the brasier and the fan.
Behold, my lads, this best of all the eels,
Six years a truant, scarce returning now.
O children, welcome her; to you I’ll give
A charcoal fire for this sweet stranger’s sake.
Out with her! Never may I lose again,
Not even in death, my darling dressed in — beet.
**Bo.** Whaur sall I get the siller for the feesh?
**Di.** This you shall give me as a market-toll.
But tell me, are these other things for sale?
**Bo.** Aye are they, a' thae goods.
**Di.** And at what price?
Or would you swap for something else?
**Bo.** I'se swap
For gear we haena, but ye Attics hae.
**Di.** Well then, what say you to *Phaleric* sprats,
Or earthenware?
**Bo.** Sprats! ware! we’ve thae at hame.
Gie us some gear we lack, an' ye've a rowth o'.
**Di.** I’ll tell you what; pack an informer up,
Like ware for exportation.
**Bo.** Mon! that’s guid.
By the Twa Gudes, [^3] an' unco gain I'se mak'.
Takin' a monkey fu' o' plaguy tricks.

[^3]: The two gods of a Boeotian are Zethus and Amphion.

Enter Nicarchus.

**Di.** And here’s Nicarchus coming to denounce
you!
**Bo.** He’s sma' in bouk.
**Di.** But every inch is bad.
**Nicarchus.** Whose is this merchandise?
**Bo.** 'Tis a' mine here.
Frae Thaibes, wat *Zeus*, I bure it.
**Ni.** Then I here
Denounce it all as enemies!
**Bo.** Hout awa!
Do ye mak' war an' enmity wi' the burdies?
**Ni.** Them and you too.
**Bo.** What hae I dune ye wrang?
**Ni.** That will I say for the bystanders’ sake.
A lantern-wick you are bringing from the foe.
**Di.** Show him up, would you, for a lantern-wick?
**Ni.** Aye, for that lantern-wick will fire the docks.
**Di.** A lantern-wick the docks! O dear, and how?
**Ni.** If a Boeotian stuck it in a beetle,
And sent it, lighted, down a watercourse
Straight to the docks, watching when *Boreas* blew

923-965

His stiffest breeze, then if the ships caught fire,
They’d blaze up in an instant.
**Di.** Blaze, you rascal!
What, with a beetle and a lantern-wick?
**Ni.** Bear witness!
**Di.** Stop his mouth, and bring me litter.
I’ll pack him up, like earthenware, for carriage,
So they mayn’t crack him on their journey home.
**Ch.** Tie up, O best of men, with care
The honest stranger’s piece of ware,
For fear they break it,
As homeward on their backs they take it.
**Di.** To that, be sure, I’ll have regard;
indeed it creaks as though ’twere charred,
By cracks molested.
And altogether God-detested.
**Ch.** How shall he deal with it?
**Di.** For every use ’tis fit,
A cup of ills, a lawsuit-can,
For audits an informing pan,
A poisoned chalice
Full filled with every kind of malice.
**Ch.** But who can safely use, I pray,
A thing like this from day to day
In household matters,
A thing that always creaks and clatters?
**Di.** He’s strong, my worthy friend, and tough:
He will not break for usage rough,
Not though you shove him
Head foremost down, his heels above him.
**Ch.** (to Boeotian) You’ve got a lovely pack.
**Bo.** A bonnie hairst I'se mak'.
**Ch.** Aye, best of friends, your harvest make,
And whereso'er it please you take
This artful, knowing
And best equipped informer going.
**Di.** 'Twas a tough business, but I’ve packed the
scamp.
Lift up and take your piece of ware, Boeotian.
**Bo.** Gae, pit your shouther underneath, Ismenias.
**Di.** And pray be careful as you take him home.
You’ve got a rotten bale of goods, but still!
And if you make a harvest out of him,
You’ll be in luck’s way, as regards informers.

Exeunt Dicaeopolis, Boeotian and his slave.

Enter servant of Lamachus.

**Servant.** Dicaeopolis!
**Di.** Well? why are you shouting?
**Se.** Why?
Lamachus bids you, towards the Pitcher-feast,
Give him some thrushes for this drachma here,
And for three drachmas one Copaic eel.
**Di.** Who is this Lamachus that wants the eel?
**Se.** The dread, the tough, the terrible, who
wields
The Gorgon targe, and shakes three shadowy
plumes.
**Di.** An eel for him? Not though his targe he gave
me!
Let him go shake his plumes at his salt fish.
If he demur, I’ll call the Market clerks.
Now for myself I’ll carry all these things
Indoors, to the tune o' merles an' mavises wings.

Exit.

## Chorus

Have ye seen him, all ye people,
seen the man of matchless art,
Seen him, by his private treaty,
traffic gain from every mart.
Goods from every neighbour;
Some required for household uses;
some ’twere pleasant warm to eat;
All the wealth of all the cities
lavished here before his feet,
Free from toil and labour.
War I’ll never welcome in
to share my hospitality,
Never shall the fellow sing
*Harmodius* in my company,
Always in his cups he acts
so rudely and offensively.
Tipsily he burst upon
our happy quiet family,
Breaking this, upsetting that,
and brawling most pugnaciously.
Yea when we entreated him
with hospitable courtesy,
“Sit you down, and drink a cup,
a Cup of Love and Harmony,”
All the more he burnt the poles
we wanted for our husbandry,
Aye and spilt perforce the liquor
treasured up within our vines.
Proudly he prepares to banquet.
Did ye mark him, all elate,
As a sample of his living
cast these plumes before his gate?
Grand his ostentation!
O of Cypris foster-sister,
and of every heavenly Grace,
Never knew I till this moment
all the glory of thy face,
Reconciliation!
O that Love would you and me
unite in endless harmony,
Love as he is pictured with
the wreath of roses smilingly.
Maybe you regard me as
a fragment of antiquity:
Ah, but if I get you, dear,
I’ll show my triple husbandry.
First a row of vinelets will I
plant prolonged and orderly,
Next the little fig-tree shoots
beside them, growing lustily,
Thirdly the domestic vine;
although I am so elderly.
Round them all shall olives grow,
to form a pleasant boundary.
Thence will you and I anoint us,
darling, when the New Moon shines.

# The Acharnians

*(Enter Crier, while the *eccyclema* exposes to view the interior of Dicaeopolis’s house.)*

**Crier.** O yes! O yes!
  Come, drain your pitchers to the trumpet’s sound,
  In our old fashion. Whoso drains his first,
  Shall have, for prize, a skin of—Ctesiphon.

**Dicaeopolis.** Lads! Lassies! Heard ye not the words he said?
  What are ye at? Do ye not hear the Crier?
  Quick! stew and roast, and turn the roasting flesh,
  Unspit the hare-meat, weave the coronals,
  Bring the spits here, and I’ll impale the thrushes.

**Chorus.** I envy much your happy plan,
  I envy more, you lucky man,
  The joys you’re now possessing.

**Dicaeopolis.** What, when around the spits you see
  the thrushes roasting gloriously?

**Chorus.** And that’s a saying I admire.

**Dicaeopolis.** Boy, poke up the charcoal fire.

**Chorus.** O listen with what cookly art
  And gracious care, so trim and smart,
  His own repast he’s dressing.

*(Enter Dercetes, an Athenian farmer.)*

**Farmer.** Alas! Alas!

**Dicaeopolis.** O Heracles, who’s there?

**Farmer.** An ill-starred man.

**Dicaeopolis.** Then keep it to yourself.

**Farmer.** O— for you only hold the truces, dear—
  Measure me out though but five years of Peace.

**Dicaeopolis.** What ails you?

**Farmer.** Ruined! Lost my oxen twain.

**Dicaeopolis.** Where from?

**Farmer.** From Phyle. The Boeotians stole them.

**Dicaeopolis.** And yet you are clad in white, you ill-starred loon!

**Farmer.** They twain maintained me in the very lap
  Of affluent luxury.

**Dicaeopolis.** Well, what want you now?

**Farmer.** Lost my two eyes, weeping my oxen twain.
  Come, if you care for Dercetes of Phyle,
  Rub some Peace-ointment, do, on my two eyes.

**Dicaeopolis.** Why, bless the fool, I’m not a public surgeon.

**Farmer.** Do now; I’ll maybe find my oxen twain.

**Dicaeopolis.** No, go and weep at Pittalus's door.

**Farmer.** Do, just one single drop. Just drop me here
  Into this quill one little drop of Peace.

**Dicaeopolis.** No, not one twitterlet; take your tears elsewhere.

**Farmer.** Alas! Alas! my darling yoke of oxen.
*(Exit.)*

**Chorus.** He loves the Treaty’s pleasant taste;
  He will not be, methinks, in haste
  To let another share it.

**Dicaeopolis.** Pour on the tripe the honey, you!
  And you, the cuttle richly stew!

**Chorus.** How trumpet-like his orders sound!

**Dicaeopolis.** Be sure the bits of eel are browned.

**Chorus.** The words you speak, your savoury rites,
  Keep sharpening so our appetites
  That we can hardly bear it.

**Dicaeopolis.** Now roast these other things and brown them nicely.

*(Enter Groomsman.)*

**Dicaeopolis.** Who’s there? who’s there?

**Groomsman.** A bridegroom sends you from his wedding-banquet
  These bits of meat.

**Dicaeopolis.** Well done, whoe'er he is.

**Groomsman.** And in return he bids you pour him out,
  To keep him safely with his bride at home,
  Into this ointment-pot one dram of Peace.

**Dicaeopolis.** Take, take your meat away; I can’t abide it.
  Not for ten thousand drachmas would I give him
  One drop of Peace.
*(Enter Bridesmaid.)*
  Hey, who comes here?

**Groomsman.** The bridesmaid
  Bringing a private message from the bride.

**Dicaeopolis.** Well, what have you to say? What wants the bride?
*(Affects to listen.)*
  O heaven, the laughable request she makes
  To keep her bridegroom safely by her side.
  I’ll do it; bring the truces; she’s a woman,
  Unfit to bear the burdens of the war.
  Now, hold the myrrh-box underneath, my girl.
  Know you the way to use it? Tell the bride,
  When they’re enrolling soldiers for the war,
  To rub the bridegroom every night with this.

*(Exeunt Groomsman and Bridesmaid.)*

**Dicaeopolis.** Now take the truces back, and bring the ladle.
  I’ll fill the winecups for the Pitcher-feast.

**Chorus.** But here runs one with eyebrows puckered up.
  Methinks he comes a messenger of woe.

*(Enter Crier.)*

**Crier.** O toils, and fights, and fighting Lamachuses!

**Lamachus.** (Within) Who clangs around my bronze-accoutred halls?
*(Enter Lamachus.)*

**Crier.** The generals bid you take your crests and cohorts,
  And hurry off this instant; to keep watch
  Amongst the mountain passes in the snow.
  For news has come that at this Pitcher-feast
  Boeotian bandits mean to raid our lands.

**Lamachus.** O generals, great in numbers, small in worth!
  Shame that I may not even enjoy the feast.

**Dicaeopolis.** O expedition battle-Lamachaean!

**Lamachus.** O dear, what, you! Do you insult me too?

**Dicaeopolis.** What, would you fight with Geryon, the four-winged?

**Lamachus.** O woe!
  O what a message has this Crier brought me!

**Dicaeopolis.** Oho! what message will this runner bring me?

*(Enter Messenger.)*

**Messenger.** Dicaeopolis!

**Dicaeopolis.** Well?

**Messenger.** Come at once to supper,
  And bring your pitcher, and your supper-chest.
  The priest of Bacchus sends to fetch you thither.
  And do be quick: you keep the supper waiting.
  For all things else are ready and prepared,
  The couches, tables, sofa-cushions, rugs,
  Wreaths, sweetmeats, myrrh, the harlotry are there,
  Whole-meal cakes, cheese-cakes, sesame-, honey-cakes,
  And dancing-girls, “Harmodius’ dearest ones.”
  So pray make haste.

**Lamachus.** O wretched, wretched me!

**Dicaeopolis.** Aye, the great Gorgon 'twas you chose for patron.
  Now close the house, and pack the supper up.

**Lamachus.** Boy, bring me out my soldier's knapsack here.

**Dicaeopolis.** Boy, bring me out my supper-basket here.

**Lamachus.** Boy, bring me onions, with some thymy salt.

**Dicaeopolis.** For me, fish-fillets; onions I detest.

**Lamachus.** Boy, bring me here a leaf of rotten fish.

**Dicaeopolis.** A tit-bit leaf for me; I'll toast it there.

**Lamachus.** Now bring me here my helmet's double plume.

**Dicaeopolis.** And bring me here my thrushes and ring-doves.

**Lamachus.** How nice and white this ostrich-plume to view!

**Dicaeopolis.** How nice and brown this pigeon's flesh to eat!

**Lamachus.** Man, don't keep jeering at my armour so!

**Dicaeopolis.** Man, don't keep peering at my thrushes so!

**Lamachus.** Bring me the casket with the three crests in it.

**Dicaeopolis.** Bring me the basket with the hare's flesh in it.

**Lamachus.** Surely the moths my crest have eaten up.

**Dicaeopolis.** Sure this hare-soup I'll eat before I sup.

**Lamachus.** Fellow, I'll thank you not to talk to me.

**Dicaeopolis.** Nay, but the boy and I, we can't agree.
  Come, will you bet, and Lamachus decide,
  Locusts or thrushes, which the daintier are?

**Lamachus.** Insolent knave!

**Dicaeopolis.** (to the boy) Locusts, he says, by far.

**Lamachus.** Boy, boy, take down the spear, and bring it here.

**Dicaeopolis.** Boy, take the sweetbread off and bring it here.

**Lamachus.** Hold firmly to the spear whilst I pull off the case.

**Dicaeopolis.** And you, hold firmly to the spit.

**Lamachus.** Boy, bring the framework to support my shield.

**Dicaeopolis.** Boy, bring the bake-meats to support my frame.

**Lamachus.** Bring here the grim-backed circle of the shield.

**Dicaeopolis.** And here the cheese-backed circle of the cake.

**Lamachus.** Is not this—mockery, plain for men to see?

**Dicaeopolis.** Is not this—cheese-cake, sweet for men to eat?

**Lamachus.** Pour on the oil, boy. Gazing on my shield,
  I see an old man tried for cowardliness.

**Dicaeopolis.** Pour on the honey. Gazing on my cake,
  I see an old man mocking Lamachus.

**Lamachus.** Bring me a casque, to arm the outer man.

**Dicaeopolis.** Bring me a cask to warm the inner man.

**Lamachus.** With this I'll arm myself against the foe.

**Dicaeopolis.** With this I'll warm myself against the feast.

**Lamachus.** Boy, lash the blankets up against the shield.

**Dicaeopolis.** Boy, lash the supper up against the chest.

**Lamachus.** Myself will bear my knapsack for myself.

**Dicaeopolis.** Myself will wear my wraps, and haste away.

**Lamachus.** Take up the shield, my boy, and bring it on.
  Snowing! Good lack, a wintry prospect mine.

**Dicaeopolis.** Take up the chest; a suppery prospect mine.

*(Exeunt Dicaeopolis and Lamachus.)*

**Chorus.** Off to your duties, my heroes bold.
  Different truly the paths ye tread;
  One to drink with wreaths on his head;
  One to watch, and shiver with cold,
  Lonely, the while his antagonist passes
  The sweetest of hours with the sweetest of lasses.
  Pray we that Zeus calmly reduce
  to destruction emphatic and utter
  That meanest of poets and meanest of men,
  Antimachus, offspring of Sputter;
  The Choregus who sent me away
  without any supper at all
  At the feast of *Lenaea*; I pray,
  two Woes that Choregus befall.
  May he hanker for a dish
  of the subtle cuttle-fish;
  May he see the cuttle sailing
  through its brine and through its oil,
  On its little table lying,
  hot and hissing from the frying,
  Till it anchor close beside him,
  when alas! and woe betide him!
  As he reaches forth his hand
  for the meal the Gods provide him,
  May a dog snatch and carry off the spoil, off the spoil,
  May a dog snatch and carry off the spoil.
  Duly the first Woe is rehearsed;
  attend whilst the other I'm telling.
  It is night, and our gentleman, after a ride,
  is returning on foot to his dwelling;
  With ague he's sorely bested,
  and he's feeling uncommonly ill,
  When suddenly down on his head
  comes Orestes's club with a will.
  'Tis Orestes, hero mad,
  'tis the drunkard and the pad.
  Then stooping in the darkness
  let him grope about the place,
  If his hand can find a brickbat
  at Orestes to be flung;
  But instead of any brickbat
  may he grasp a podge of dung,
  And rushing on with this, Orestes may he miss,
  And hit young Cratinus in the face, in the face,
  And hit young Cratinus in the face.

*(Enter Attendant.)*

**Attendant.** Varlets who dwell in Lamachus's halls,
  Heat water, knaves, heat water in a pot.
  Make ready lint, and salves, and greasy wool,
  And ankle-bandages. Your lord is hurt,
  Pierced by a stake whilst leaping o'er a trench.
  Then, twisting round, he wrenched his ankle out,
  And, falling, cracked his skull upon a stone;
  And shocked the sleeping Gorgon from his shield.
  Then the Great Boastard's plume being cast away
  Prone on the rocks, a dolorous cry he raised,
  “O glorious Eye, with this my last fond look
  The heavenly light I leave; my day is done.”
  He spake, and straightway falls into a ditch;
  Jumps up again; confronts the runaways,
  And prods the fleeing bandits with his spear.
  But here he enters. Open wide the door.

*(Re-enter Lamachus wounded, supported by attendants, and Dicaeopolis jovial between two courtesans.)*

**Lamachus.** O lack-a-day! O lack-a-day!
  I'm hacked, I'm killed, by hostile lances!
  But worse than wound or lance 'twill grieve me
  If Dicaeopolis perceive me
  And mock, and mock at my mischances.

**Dicaeopolis.** O lucky day! O lucky day!
  What mortal ever can be richer,
  Than he who feels, my golden misses,
  Your softest, closest, loveliest kisses.
  'Twas I, 'twas I, first drained the pitcher.

**Lamachus.** O me, my woeful dolorous lot!
  O me, the gruesome wounds I've got!

**Dicaeopolis.** My darling Lamachippus, is it not?

**Lamachus.** O doleful chance!

**Dicaeopolis.** O cursed spite!

**Lamachus.** Why give me a kiss?

**Dicaeopolis.** Why give me a bite?

**Lamachus.** O me, the heavy, heavy charge they tried.

**Dicaeopolis.** Who makes a charge this happy Pitcher-feast?

**Lamachus.** O Paean, Healer! Heal me, Paean, pray.

**Dicaeopolis.** 'Tis not the Healer's festival today.

**Lamachus.** O lift me gently round the hips,
  My comrades true!

**Dicaeopolis.** O kiss me warmly on the lips,
  My darlings, do!

**Lamachus.** My brain is dizzy with the blow
  Of hostile stone.

**Dicaeopolis.** Mine's dizzy too: to bed I'll go,
  And not alone.

**Lamachus.** O take me in your healing hands, and bring
  To Pittalus this battered frame of mine.

**Dicaeopolis.** O take me to the judges. Where's the King
  That rules the feast? Hand me my skin of wine.

**Lamachus.** A lance has struck me through the bone
  So piteously! So piteously!
*(He is helped off the stage.)*

**Dicaeopolis.** I've drained the pitcher all alone;
  Sing ho! Sing ho! for Victory!

**Chorus.** Sing ho! Sing ho! for Victory then,
  If so you bid, if so you bid.

**Dicaeopolis.** I filled it with neat wine, my men,
  And quaffed it at a gulp, I did.

**Chorus.** Sing ho! brave heart, the wineskin take,
  And onward go, and onward go.

**Dicaeopolis.** And ye must follow in my wake,
  And sing for Victory ho! sing ho!

**Chorus.** O yes, we'll follow for your sake
  Your wineskin and yourself, I trow.
  Sing ho! for Victory won, sing ho!
