Chorus of Thesmophoriazusae

Two elderly men are discovered, when the Play opens, pacing along an Athenian street. In one, both by his gait and by his language, we at once recognize a Philosopher and a Genius. His companion is a garrulous and cheery old man, evidently tired out by a long promenade. They prove to be the poet *Euripides*, and *Mnesilochus*, his connexion by marriage, in the translation inaccurately styled his cousin. The latter is the first to speak.

Mnesilochus. *Zeus*! Is the swallow never going to come?
Tramped up and down since daybreak! I can’t stand it.
Might I, before my wind’s entirely gone,
Ask where you’re taking me, *Euripides*?

Euripides. You’re not to hear the things which face to face
You’re going to see.

Mnesilochus. What! Please say that again.
I’m not to hear?

Euripides. The things which you shall see.

Mnesilochus. And not to see?

Euripides. The things which you shall hear.

Mnesilochus. A pleasant jest! A mighty pleasant jest!
I’m not to hear or see at all, I see.

Euripides. (*In high philosophic rhapsody*)
To hear! To see! Full different things, I ween;
Yea verily, generically diverse.

Mnesilochus. What’s “diverse”?

Euripides. I will explicate my meaning.
When *Ether* first was mapped and parcelled out,
And living creatures breathed and moved in her,
She, to give sight, implanted in their heads
The Eye, a mimic circlet of the Sun,
And bored the funnel of the Ear, to hear with.

Mnesilochus. Did she! That’s why I’m not to hear or see!
I’m very glad to get that information!
O, what a thing it is to talk with Poets!

Euripides. Much of such knowledge I shall give you.

Mnesilochus. (*Involuntarily*) O!
Then p’raps (excuse me) you will tell me how
Not to be lame tomorrow, after this.

Euripides. (*Loftily disregarding the innuendo*)
Come here and listen.

Mnesilochus. (*Courteously*) Certainly I will.

Euripides. See you that wicket?

Mnesilochus. Why, by *Heracles*,
Of course I do.

Euripides. Be still.

Mnesilochus. Be still the wicket?

Euripides. And most attentive.

Mnesilochus. Still attentive wicket?

Euripides. There dwells, observe, the famous *Agathon*,
The Tragic Poet.

Mnesilochus. (*Considering*) *Agathon*. Don’t know him.

Euripides. He is that *Agathon*—

Mnesilochus. (*Interrupting*) Dark, brawny fellow?

Euripides. O no, quite different; don’t you know him really?

Mnesilochus. Big-whiskered fellow?

Euripides. Don’t you know him really?

Mnesilochus. No. (*Things again*) No, I don’t; at least I don’t remember.

Euripides. (*Severely*) I fear there’s much you don’t remember, sir.
But step aside: I see his servant coming.
See, he has myrtles and a pan of coals
To pray, methinks, for favourable rhymes.

The two retire into the background. *Agathon’s* servant enters from the house.

Servant. All people be still!
Allow not a word from your lips to be heard,
For the Muses are here, and are making their odes
In my Master’s abodes.
Let *Ether* be lulled, and forgetful to blow,
And the blue sea-waves, let them cease to flow,
And be noiseless.

Mnesilochus. Fudge!

Euripides. Hush, hush, if you please.

Servant. Sleep, birds of the air, with your pinions at ease;
Sleep, beasts of the field, with entranquillized feet;
Sleep, sleep, and be still.

Mnesilochus. Fudge, fudge, I repeat.

Servant. For the soft and the terse professor of verse,
Our *Agathon* now is about to—

Mnesilochus. (*Scandalized*) No, no!

Servant. What’s that?

Mnesilochus. ’Twas the *ether*, forgetting to blow!

Servant. (*Beginning pettishly, but soon falling back into his former tone*)
I was going to say he is going to lay
The stocks and the scaffolds for building a play.
And neatly he hews them, and sweetly he glues them,
And a proverb he takes, and an epithet makes,
And he moulds a most waxen and delicate song,
And he tunnels, and funnels, and—

Mnesilochus. Does what is wrong.

Servant. What clown have we here, so close to our eaves?

Mnesilochus. Why, one who will take you and him, by your leaves,
Both you and your terse professor of verse,
And with blows and with knocks set you both on the stocks,
And tunnel and funnel, and pummel, and worse.

Servant. Old man, you must have been a rare pert youngster.

Euripides. O, heed not him! But quickly call me out
Your master *Agathon*; do pray make haste.

Servant. No need of prayer: he’s coming forth directly.
He’s moulding odes; and in the cold hard winter
He cannot turn, and twist, and shape his strophes
Until they are warmed and softened in the sun.

The servant goes back into the house.

Mnesilochus. And what am I to do?

Euripides. You’re to keep quiet.
O *Zeus*! The Hour is come, and so’s the Man!

Mnesilochus. O, what’s the matter? What disturbs you so?
O, tell me what: I really want to know.
Come, I’m your cousin; won’t you tell your cousin?

Euripides. There’s a great danger brewing for my life.

Mnesilochus. O, tell your cousin what.

Euripides. This hour decides
Whether *Euripides* shall live or die.

Mnesilochus. Why, how is that? There’s no tribunal sitting,
No Court, no Council, will be held today.
’Tis the Mid-Fast, the third Home-Festival.

Euripides. It is! It is! I wish enough it wasn’t.
For on this day the womankind have sworn
To hold a great assembly, to discuss
How best to serve me out.

Mnesilochus. Good gracious! Why?

Euripides. (*With the mild surprise of injured innocence*)
Because, they say, I write lampoons upon them.

Mnesilochus. *Zeus* and *Poseidon*! They may well say that.
But tell your cousin what you mean to do.

Euripides. I want to get the poet *Agathon*
To go among them.

Mnesilochus. Tell your cousin why.

Euripides. To mingle in the Assembly, perhaps to speak
On my behalf.

Mnesilochus. What, openly, do you mean?

Euripides. O no, disguised: dressed up in women’s clothes.

Mnesilochus. A bright idea that, and worthy you:
For in all craftiness we take the cake.

By a contrivance very common in ancient theatres, a portion of *Agathon’s* house is here wheeled forward, turning on a pivot, so as to disclose the interior of an apartment. The poet is discovered, surrounded by the most effeminate luxuries, and in the act of writing a tragic play. He has just composed, and is now about to recite, a little lyrical dialogue between his Chorus and one of his actors.

Euripides. O, hush!

Mnesilochus. What now?

Euripides. Here’s *Agathon* himself.

Mnesilochus. Where? Which?

Euripides. Why there: the man in the machine.

Mnesilochus. O dear, what ails me? Am I growing blind?
I see *Cyrene*; but I see no man.

Euripides. Do, pray, be silent; he’s just going to sing.

*Agathon* now gives a fantastic little trill.

Mnesilochus. Is it ‘the Pathway of the Ants,’ or what?

*Agathon* now sings his little dialogue in a soft womanly voice and with pretty, effeminate gestures.

Agathon. (*As actor*) Move ye slowly, with the holy
Torchlight dear to Awful Shades,
Singing sweetly, dancing featly,
Yes, and neatly, freeborn maids.

(*As Chorus*) Whose the song of festal praise?
Only tell us, we are zealous
Evermore our hymns to raise.

(*As actor*) Sing of *Leto*, sing of Thee too,
Archer of the golden bow,
Bright *Apollo*, in the hollow
Glades where *Ilian* rivers flow,
Building buildings, long ago.

(*As Chorus*) Raise the music, softly swelling
To the fame of *Leto’s* name,
To the God in song excelling,
Brightest he, of all there be,
Giving gifts of minstrelsy.

(*As actor*) Sing the maiden, quiver-laden,
From the woodland oaks emerging,
Haunted shades of mountain glades,
*Artemis*, the ever Virgin.

(*As Chorus*) We rejoice, heart and voice,
Hymning, praising, gently phrasing,
Her, the maiden quiver-laden.

(*As actor*) Soft pulsation of the *Asian*
Lyre, to which the dancers go,
When the high and holy *Graces*
Weave their swiftly whirling paces,
*Phrygian* measure, to and fro.

(*As Chorus*) Lyre *Elysian*, heavenly vision,
When thy witching tones arise,
Comes the light of joy and gladness
Flashing from immortal eyes.
Eyes will glisten, ears will listen,
When our manful numbers ring.
Mighty master, Son of *Leto*,
Thine the glory, Thou the King.

*Mnesilochus* utters a cry of delight.

Mnesilochus. Wonderful! Wonderful!
How sweet, how soft, how ravishing the strain!
What melting words! And as I heard them sung,
Ye amorous Powers, there crept upon my soul
A pleasant, dreamy, rapturous titillation.
And now, dear youth, for I would question thee
And sift thee with the words of *Aeschylus*,
Whence art thou, what thy country, what thy garb?
Why all this wondrous medley? Lyre and silks,
A minstrel’s lute, a maiden’s netted hair,
Girdle and wrestler’s oil! A strange conjunction.
How comes a sword beside a looking-glass?
What art thou, man or woman? If a man,
Where are his clothes? His red *Laconian* shoes?
If woman, ’tis not like a woman’s shape.
What art thou, speak; or if thou tell me not,
Myself must guess thy gender from thy song.

Agathon. Old man, old man, my ears receive the words
Of your tongue’s utterance, yet I heed them not.
I choose my dress to suit my poesy.
A poet, sir, must needs adapt his ways
To the high thoughts which animate his soul.
And when he sings of women, he assumes
A woman’s garb, and dons a woman’s habits.

Mnesilochus. (*Aside to Euripides*) When you wrote *Phaedra*, did you take her habits?

Agathon. But when he sings of men, his whole appearance
Conforms to man. What nature gives us not,
The human soul aspires to imitate.

Mnesilochus. (*As before*) Zounds, if I’d seen you when you wrote the *Satyrs*!

Agathon. Besides, a poet never should be rough,
Or harsh, or rugged. Witness to my words
*Anacreon*, *Alcaeus*, *Ibycus*,
Who when they filtered and diluted song,
Wore soft *Ionian* manners and attire.
And *Phrynichus*, perhaps you have seen him, sir,
How fair he was, and beautifully dressed;
Therefore his plays were beautifully fair.
For as the Worker, so the Work will be.

Mnesilochus. Then that is why harsh *Philocles* writes harshly,
And that is why vile *Xenocles* writes vilely,
And cold *Theognis* writes such frigid plays.

Agathon. Yes, that is why. And I perceiving this
Made myself womanlike.

Mnesilochus. My goodness, how?

Euripides. O, stop that yapping: in my youthful days
I too was such another one as he.

Mnesilochus. Good gracious! I don’t envy you your schooling.

Euripides. (*Sharply*) Pray, let us come to business, sir.

Mnesilochus. Say on.

Euripides. A wise man, *Agathon*, compacts his words,
And many thoughts compresses into few.
So, I in my extremity am come
To ask a favour of you.

Agathon. Tell me what.

Euripides. The womankind at their Home-feast today
Are going to pay me out for my lampoons.

Agathon. That’s bad indeed, but how can I assist you?

Euripides. Why, every way. If you’ll disguise yourself,
And sit among them like a woman born,
And plead my cause, you’ll surely get me off.
There’s none but you to whom I dare entrust it.

Agathon. Why don’t you go yourself, and plead your cause?

Euripides. I’ll tell you why. They know me well by sight;
And I am grey, you see, and bearded too,
But you’ve a baby face, a treble voice,
A fair complexion, pretty, smooth, and soft.

Agathon. *Euripides*!

Euripides. Yes.

Agathon. Wasn’t it you who wrote
“You value life; do you think your father doesn’t?”

Euripides. It was: what then?

Agathon. Expect not me to bear
Your burdens; that were foolishness indeed.
Each man must bear his sorrows for himself.
And troubles, when they come, must needs be met
By manful acts, and not by shifty tricks.

Mnesilochus. Aye, true for you, your wicked ways are shown
By sinful acts, and not by words alone.

Euripides. But tell me really why you fear to go.

Agathon. They’d serve me worse than you.

Euripides. How so?

Agathon. How so?
I’m too much like a woman, and they’d think
That I was come to poach on their preserves.

Mnesilochus. Well, I must say that’s not a bad excuse.

Euripides. Then won’t you really help?

Agathon. I really won’t.

Euripides. Thrice luckless I! *Euripides* is done for!

Mnesilochus. O friend! O cousin! Don’t lose heart like this.

Euripides. Whatever can I do?

Mnesilochus. Bid him go hang!
See here am I; deal with me as you please.

Euripides. (*Striding while the iron is hot*)
Well, if you’ll really give yourself to me,
First throw aside this overcloak.

Mnesilochus. ’Tis done.
But how are you going to treat me?

Euripides. Shave you here,
And singe you down below.

Mnesilochus. (*Magnanimously*) Well, do your worst;
I’ve said you may, and I’ll go through with it.

Euripides. You’ve always, *Agathon*, got a razor handy;
Lend us one, will you?

Agathon. Take one for yourself
Out of the razor-case.

Euripides. Obliging youth!
(*To Mnesilochus*) Now sit you down (*Mnesilochus* seats himself in a chair), and puff your right cheek out.

Mnesilochus. Oh!

Euripides. What’s the matter? Shut your mouth, or else
I’ll clap a gag in.

Mnesilochus. Lackalackaday!

He jumps up, and runs away.

Euripides. Where are you fleeing?

Mnesilochus. To sanctuary I.
Shall I sit quiet to be hacked like that?
*Demeter*, no!

Euripides. Think how absurd you’ll look,
With one cheek shaven, and the other not.

Mnesilochus. (*Doggedly*) Well, I don’t care.

Euripides. O, by the Gods, come back.
Pray don’t forsake me.

Mnesilochus. Miserable me!

He resumes his seat. *Euripides* goes on with the shaving.

Euripides. Sit steady; raise your chin; don’t wriggle so.

Mnesilochus. (*Wincing*) O tchi, tchi, tchi!

Euripides. There, there, it’s over now.

Mnesilochus. And I’m, worse luck, a Rifled Volunteer.

Euripides. Well, never mind; you’re looking beautiful.
Glance in this mirror.

Mnesilochus. Well then, hand it here.

Euripides. What see you there?

Mnesilochus. (*In disgust*) Not me, but *Cleisthenes*.

Euripides. Get up: bend forward. I’ve to singe you now.

Mnesilochus. O me, you’ll scald me like a sucking-pig.

Euripides. Someone within there, bring me out a torch.
Now then, stoop forward: gently; mind yourself.

Mnesilochus. I’ll see to that. Hey! I’ve caught fire there. Hey!
O, water! water! Neighbours, bring your buckets.
Fire! Fire! I tell you; I’m on fire, I am!

Euripides. There, it’s all right.

Mnesilochus. All right, when I’m a cinder?

Euripides. Well, well, the worst is over; ’tis indeed.
It won’t pain now.

Mnesilochus. Faugh, here’s a smell of burning!
Drat it, I’m roasted all about the stern.

Euripides. Nay, heed it not. I’ll have it sponged directly.

Mnesilochus. I’d like to catch a fellow sponging me.

Euripides. Though you begrudge your active personal aid,
Yet, *Agathon*, you won’t refuse to lend us
A dress and sash: you can’t deny you’ve got them.

Agathon. Take them, and welcome. I begrudge them not.

Mnesilochus. What’s first to do?

Euripides. Put on this yellow silk.

Mnesilochus. By *Aphrodite*, but ’tis wondrous nice.

Euripides. Gird it up tighter.

Mnesilochus. Where’s the girdle?

Euripides. Here.

Mnesilochus. Make it sit neatly there about the legs.

Euripides. Now for a snood and hair-net.

Agathon. Will this do?
It’s quite a natty hairdress; it’s my nightcap.

Euripides. The very thing: i’faith, the very thing.

Mnesilochus. Does it look well?

Euripides. *Zeus*! I should think it did!
Now for a mantle.

Agathon. Take one from the couch.

Euripides. A pair of woman’s shoes.

Agathon. Well, here are mine.

Mnesilochus. Do they look well?

Euripides. They are loose enough, I trow.

Agathon. You see to that; I’ve lent you all you need.
Will someone kindly wheel me in again?

*Agathon’s* apartment, with *Agathon* in it, is wheeled back into the house; *Euripides* and *Mnesilochus* are left standing on the stage. *Euripides* turns *Mnesilochus* round, and surveys him with complacency.

Euripides. There then, the man’s a regular woman now,
At least to look at; and if you’ve to speak,
Put on a feminine mincing voice.

Mnesilochus. (*In a shrill treble*) I’ll try.

Euripides. And now begone, and prosper.

Mnesilochus. Wait a bit.
Not till you’ve sworn—

Euripides. Sworn what?

Mnesilochus. That if I get
In any scrape, you’ll surely see me through.

Euripides. I swear by *Ether*, *Zeus’s* dwelling-place.

Mnesilochus. As well by vile *Hippocrates’s* cabin.

Euripides. Well, then, I swear by every blessed God.

Mnesilochus. And please remember ’twas your mind that swore,
Not your tongue only; please remember that.

The background of the scene opens and a large building is pushed forward upon the stage, representing the *Thesmophorium* or Temple of the Home-givers. The Athenian ladies, who form the chorus of the Play, are seen, a few lines later, thronging into the orchestra, to assist in the solemnities of the festival, and to take part in the Assembly they are about to hold. The air above them is thick like smoke of the torches they are bearing in their hands. *Euripides* thinks it time to make himself scarce. *Mnesilochus* assumes the fussy airs and treble voice of an Athenian matron, talking to an imaginary maid-servant.

Euripides. O, get you gone: for there’s the signal hoisted
Over the Temple; they are assembling now.
I think I’ll leave you.

Mnesilochus. *Thratta*, come along.
O *Thratta*, *Thratta*, here’s a lot of women
Coming up here! O, what a flare of torches!
O sweet Twain-goddesses, vouchsafe me now
A pleasant day, and eke a safe return.
Set down the basket, *Thratta*; give me out
The sacred cake to offer to the Twain.
O dread *Demeter*, high unearthly one,
O *Persephassa*, grant your votaress grace
To join in many festivals like this,
Or if not so, at least escape this once.
And may my daughter, by your leaves, pick up
A wealthy husband, and a fool to boot;
And little Bull-calf have his share of brains.
Now, then, I wonder which is the best place
To hear the speeches? *Thratta*, you may go.

The officials now take their places, and the Assembly at once begins.

Mnesilochus. These are not things for servant-girls to hear.

Crieress. Worldly clamour
Pass away!
Silence, Silence,
While we pray;
To the Twain, the Home-bestowers,
Holy Parent, holy Daughter,
And to Wealth, and Heavenly Beauty,
And to Earth the foster-mother,
And to *Hermes* and the *Graces*,
That they to this important high debate
Grant favour and success,
Making it useful to the Athenian State,
And to ourselves no less.
And O, that she who counsels best today
About the Athenian nation,
And our own commonwealth of women, may
Succeed by acclamation.
These things we pray, and blessings on our cause.
Sing *Paean*, *Paean*, ho! with merry loud applause.

Chorus. We in thy prayers combine,
And we trust the Powers Divine
Will on these their suppliants smile,
Both *Zeus* the high and awful,
And the golden-lyred *Apollo*
From the holy *Delian* isle.
And thou, our Mighty Maiden,
Lance of gold, and eye of blue,
Of the God-contested city,
Help us too:
And the many-named, the Huntress.
Gold-fronted *Leto’s* daughter;
And the dread *Poseidon* ruling
Over Ocean’s stormy water;
Come from the deep where fishes
Swarm, and the whirlwinds rave;
And the *Oreads* of the mountain,
And the *Nereids* of the wave.
Let the Golden Harp sound o’er us
And the Gods with favour crown
This Parliament of Women,
The free and noble matrons
Of the old Athenian town.

Crieress. O yes! O yes!
Pray ye the *Olympian* Gods—and Goddesses,
And all the *Pythian* Gods—and Goddesses,
And all the *Delian* Gods—and Goddesses,
And all the other Gods—and Goddesses,
Whoso is disaffected, ill-disposed
Towards this commonwealth of womankind,
Or with *Euripides*, or with the *Medes*
Deals to the common hurt of womankind,
Or aims at tyranny, or fain would bring
The Tyrant back; or dares betray a wife
For palming off a baby as her own;
Or tells her master tales against her mistress;
Or does not bear a message faithfully;
Or, being a suitor, makes a vow, and then
Fails to perform; or, being a rich old woman,
Hires for herself a lover with her wealth;
Or, being a girl, takes gifts and cheats the giver;
Or, being a trading man or trading woman,
Gives us short measure in our drinking-cups;
Perish that man, himself and all his house;
But pray the Gods—and Goddesses—to order
To all the women always all things well.

Chorus. We also pray,
And trust it may
Be done as thou premisest,
And hope that they
Will win the day
Whose words are best and wisest.
But they who fain
Would cheat for gain,
Their solemn oaths forgetting,
Our ancient laws
And noble cause
And mystic rites upsetting;
Who plot for greed,
Who call the *Mede*
With secret invitation,
I say that these
The Gods displease,
And wrong the Athenian nation.
O *Zeus* most high
In earth and sky,
All-powerful, all-commanding,
We pray to Thee,
Weak women we,
But help us notwithstanding.

Crieress. O yes! O yes! The Women’s Council-Board
Hath thus enacted (moved by *Sostrata*,
President *Timocleia*, clerk *Lysilla*),
To hold a morning Parliament today
When women most have leisure; to discuss
What shall be done about *Euripides*,
How best to serve him out; for that he’s guilty
We all admit. Who will address the meeting?

First Woman. I wish to, I.

Crieress. Put on this chaplet first.
Order! Order! Silence, ladies, if you please.
She’s learnt the trick; she hems and haws;
She coughs in preparation;
I know the signs; my soul divines
A mighty long oration.

First Woman. ’Tis not from any feeling of ambition
I rise to address you, ladies, but because
I long have seen, and inly burned to see
The way *Euripides* insults us all,
The really quite interminable scoffs
This market-gardener’s son pours out against us.
I don’t believe that there’s a single fault
He’s not accused us of; I don’t believe
That there’s a single theatre or stage,
But there is he, calling us double-dealers,
False, faithless, tippling, mischief-making gossips,
A rotten set, a misery to men.
Well, what’s the consequence?
The men come home
Looking so sour—O, we can see them peeping
In every closet, thinking friends are there.
Upon my word we can’t do anything
We used to do; he has made the men so silly.
Suppose I’m hard at work upon a chaplet,
“Hey, she’s in love with somebody”; suppose
I chance to drop a pitcher on the floor,
And straightway ’tis, “For whom was that intended?
I warrant now, for our *Corinthian* friend.”
Is a girl ill? Her brother shakes his head;
“The girl’s complexion is not to my taste.”
Why, if you merely want to hire a baby,
And palm it off as yours, you’ve got no chance,
They sit beside our very beds, they do.
Then there’s another thing; the rich old men
Who used to marry us, are grown so shy
We never catch them now; and all because
*Euripides* declares, the scandal-monger,
“An old man weds a tyrant, not a wife.”
You know, my sisters, how they mew us up,
Guarding our women’s rooms with bolts and seals
And fierce *Molossian* dogs. That’s all his doing.
We might put up with that; but, O my friends,
Our little special perquisites, the corn,
The wine, the oil, gone, gone, all gone forever.
They’ve got such keys, our husbands have, such brutes,
*Laconian*-made, with triple rows of teeth.
Then in old times we only had to buy
A farthing ring, and pantry-doors flew open.
But now this wretch *Euripides* has made them
Wear such worm-eaten perforated seals,
’Tis hopeless now to try it. Therefore, ladies,
What I propose is that we slay the man,
Either by poison or some other way;
Somehow or other he must die the death.
That’s all I’ll say in public: I’ll write out
A formal motion with the clerkess there.

Chorus. Good heavens! What force and tact combined!
O, what a many-woven mind!
A better speech, upon my word,
I don’t believe I ever heard.
Her thoughts so clean dissected,
Her words so well selected,
Such keen discrimination,
Such power and elevation,
’Twas really quite a grand, superb,
Magnificent oration.
So that if, in opposition,
*Xenocles* came forth to speak,
Compared with her
You’d all aver
All his grandest, happiest efforts
Are immeasurably weak!

Second Woman. Ladies, I’ve only a few words to add.
I quite agree with the honourable lady
Who has just sat down: she has spoken well and ably.
But I can tell you what I’ve borne myself.
My husband died in *Cyprus*, leaving me
Five little chicks to work and labour for.
I’ve done my best, and bad’s the best, but still
I’ve fed them, weaving chaplets for the Gods.
But now this fellow writes his plays, and says
There are no Gods; and so, you may depend,
My trade is fallen to half; men won’t buy chaplets.
So then for many reasons he must die;
The man is bitterer than his mother’s potherbs.
I leave my cause with you, my sisters: I
Am called away on urgent private business,
An order, just received, for twenty chaplets.

Chorus. Better and better still.
A subtler intellect, a daintier skill.
Wise are her words, and few;
Well timed and spoken too.
A many-woven mind she too has got, I find.
And he must clearly,
This rascal man, be punished most severely.

The motion for putting *Euripides* to death having, so to say, been proposed and seconded, *Mnesilochus* rises to speak in opposition.

Mnesilochus. Mrs. Speaker and ladies,
I’m not surprised, of course I’m not surprised,
To find you all so angry and aggrieved
At what *Euripides* has said against us.
For I myself—or slay my babies else—
Hate him like poison, to be sure I do,
He’s most provoking, I admit he is.
But now we’re all alone, there’s no reporter,
All among friends, why not be fair and candid?
Grant that the man has really found us out,
And told a thing or two, sure they’re all true,
And there’s a many thousand still behind.
For I myself, to mention no one else,
Could tell a thousand plaguy tricks I’ve played
On my poor husband; I’ll just mention one.
We’d been but three days married; I’m abed,
Husband asleep beside me; when my lover
(I’d been familiar with him from a child)
Came softly scratching at the outer door.
I hear; I know “the little clinking sound,”
And rise up stealthily, to creep downstairs.
“Where go you, pray?” says husband. “Where!” say I,
“I’ve such a dreadful pain in my inside
I must go down this instant.” “Go,” says he.
He pounds his anise, juniper, and sage,
To still my pains: I seize the water-jug,
And wet the hinge, to still its creaking noise,
Then open, and go out: and I and lover
Meet by *Aguieus* and his laurel-shade,
Billing and cooing to our hearts’ content.
(*With vivacity*) *Euripides* has never found out that.
Nor how a wife contrived to smuggle out
Her frightened lover, holding up her shawl
To the sun’s rays for husband to admire.
Nor how we grant our favours to bargees
And muleteers, if no one else we’ve got.
Nor how, arising from a night’s debauch,
We chew our garlic, that our husbands, coming
Back from the walls at daybreak, may suspect
Nothing amiss at home. Then what’s the odds
If he does rail at *Phaedra*? Let him rail.
What’s that to us? Let him rail on, say I.
*Phaedra* indeed! He might come nearer home.
I knew a woman, I won’t mention names,
Remained ten days in childbirth. Why, do you think?
Because she couldn’t buy a baby sooner.
Her husband runs to every medicine-man
In dreadful agitation; while he’s out,
They bring a little baby in a basket,
Bunging its mouth up that it mayn’t cry out,
And stow it safe away till he comes home.
Then at a given sigh she feebly says,
“My time is come: please, husband, go away.”
He goes; they open basket; baby cries.
O, what delight, surprise, congratulations!
The man runs in; the nurse comes running out
(The same that brought the baby in the basket),
“A prodigy! A Lion! Such a boy!
Your form, your features: just the same expression:
Your very image: lucky, lucky man!”
Don’t we do this? By *Artemis*, we do.
Then wherefore rail we at *Euripides*?
We’re not one bit more sinned against than sinning.

Chorus. What a monstrous, strange proceeding!
Whence, I wonder, comes her breeding?
From what country shall we seek her,
Such a bold, audacious speaker?
That a woman so should wrong us,
Here among us, here among us,
I could never have believed it;
Such a thing was never known.
But what may be, no man knoweth,
And the wise old proverb showeth,

That perchance a poisonous sophist
lurketh under every stone.
O, nothing, nothing in the world
so hateful you will find
As shameless women, save of course
the rest of womankind.
1st. W. What can possess us, sisters mine?
I vow by old Agraulus,
We’re all bewitched, or else have had
some strange mischance befall us,
To let this shameless hussy tell
her shameful, bold, improper
Unpleasant tales, and we not make
the least attempt to stop her.
If anyone assist me, good; if not, alone we’ll try,
We’ll strip and whip her well, we will,
my serving-maids and I.
Mn. Not strip me, gentle ladies; sure
I heard the proclamation,
That every freeborn woman now
might make a free oration;
And if I spoke unpleasant truths
on this your invitation,
Is that a reason why I now
should suffer castigation?
1st. W. It is, indeed: how dare you plead
for him who always chooses
Such odious subjects for his plays,
on purpose to abuse us?
*Phaedras* and *Melanippes* too:
but ne’er a drama made he
About the good *Penelope*,
or such-like virtuous lady.
Mn. The cause I know; the cause I’ll show:
you won’t discover any
*Penelope* alive to-day, but *Phaedras* very many.
1st. W. You will? you dare? how can we bear
to hear such things repeated,
Such horrid, dreadful, odious things?
Mn. O, I’ve not near completed
The things I know; I’ll give the whole:
I’m not disposed to grudge it.
1st. W. You can’t, I vow; you’ve emptied now
your whole disgusting budget.
Mn. No, not one thousandth part I’ve told:
not even how we take
The scraper from the bathing-room,
and down the corn we rake,
And push it in, and tap the bin.
1st. W. Confound you and your slanders!
Mn. Nor how the *Apaturian* meat
we steal to give our panders,
And then declare the cat was there.
1st. W. You nasty telltale you!
Mn. Nor how with deadly axe a wife
her lord and master slew,
Another drove her husband mad
with poisonous drugs fallacious,
Nor how beneath the reservoir
the *Acharnian* girl—
1st. W. Good gracious!
Mn. Buried her father out of sight.
1st. W. Now really this won’t do.
Mn. Nor how when late your servant bare
a child as well as you,
You took her boy, and in his stead
your puling girl you gave her.
1st. W. O, by the Two,¹ this jade shall rue
her insolent behaviour.
I’ll comb your fleece, you saucy minx.
Mn. By Zeus, you had best begin it.
1st. W. Come on!
Mn. Come on!
1st. W. You will? you will?
(Flinging her upper mantle to Philista)
Hold this, my dear, a minute.
Mn. Stand off, or else, by Artemis,
I’ll give you such a strumming—
Ch. For pity’s sake, be silent there:
I see a woman coming.
Who looks as if she’d news to tell.
Now prithee both be quiet
And let us hear the tale she brings,
without this awful riot.

Enter Cleisthenes, dressed as a woman.

Cleisthenes. Dear ladies, I am one with you in heart;
My cheeks, unfledged, bear witness to my love,
I am your patron, aye, and devotee.
And now, for lately in the market-place
I heard a rumour touching you and yours,
I come to warn and put you on your guard,
Lest this great danger take you unawares.
Ch. What now, my child? for we may call thee child,
So soft, and smooth, and downy are thy cheeks.
Cl. Euripides, they say, has sent a cousin,
A bad old man, amongst you here to-day.
Ch. O, why and wherefore, and with what design?
Cl. To be a spy, a horrid, treacherous spy,
A spy on all your purposes and plans.
Ch. O, how should he be here, and we not know it?
Cl. Euripides has tweezered him, and singed him,
And dressed him up, disguised in women’s clothes.
Mn. (stamping about with a lively recollection of his recent sufferings)
I don’t believe it; not one word of it;
No man would let himself be tweezered so.
Ye goddesses, I don’t believe there’s one.
Cl. Nonsense: I never should have come here else,
I had it on the best authority.
Ch. This is a most important piece of news.
We’ll take immediate steps to clear this up.
We’ll search him out: we’ll find his lurking-place.
Zounds, if we catch him! R-r-r! the rascal man.
Will you, kind gentleman, assist the search?
Give us fresh cause to thank you, patron mine.
Cl. (to first woman) Well, who are you?
Mn. (aside) Wherever can I flee?
Cl. I’ll find him, trust me.
Mn. (aside) Here’s a precious scrape!
1st. W. Who? I?
Cl. Yes, you.
1st. W. Cleonymus’s wife.
Cl. Do you know her, ladies? Is she speaking truth?
Ch. O yes, we know her: pass to someone else.
Cl. Who’s this young person with the baby here?
1st. W. O, she’s my nursemaid.
Mn. (aside) Here he comes; I’m done for.
Cl. Hey! where’s she off to? Stop! Why, what the mischief!
Ch. (aside to Cleisthenes) Yes, sift her well;
discover who she is.
We know the others, but we don’t know her.
Cl. Come, come, no shuffling, madam, turn this way.
Mn. (fretfully) Don’t pull me, sir, I’m poorly.
Cl. Please to tell me
Your husband’s name.
Mn. My husband’s name? my husband’s?
Why What-d'ye-call-him from Cothocidae.
Cl. Eh, what? (Considers)
There was a What-d'ye-call-him once—
Mn. He’s Who-d'ye-call-it's son.
Cl. You’re trifling with me.
Have you been here before?
Mn. O, bless you, yes.
Why, every year.
Cl. And with what tent-companion?
Mn. With What's-her-name.
Cl. This is sheer idling, woman.
1st. W. (to Cleisthenes) Step back, sir, please,
and let me question her
On last year’s rites; a little further, please;
No man must listen now.
(To Mnesilochus) Now, stranger, tell me
What first we practised on that holy day.
Mn. Bless me, what was it? first? why, first we—drank.
1st. W. Right; what was second?
Mn. Second? Drank again.
1st. W. Somebody’s told you this. But what was third?
Mn. Well, third, Xenylla had a drop too much.
1st. W. Ah, that won’t do. Here, Cleisthenes, approach.
This is the man for certain.
Cl. Bring him up.

Mnesilochus is seized, carried before a jury of matrons, and pronounced a man! A general uproar ensues.

1st. W. Strip off his clothes! for there’s no truth in him.
Mn. What! strip the mother of nine little ones?
Cl. Loosen that belt, look sharp, you shameless thing.
1st. W. She does appear a stout and sturdy one:
Upon my word, she has no breasts like ours.
Mn. Because I’m barren, never had a child.
1st. W. Yes, now! but then you had nine little ones!
Cl. Stand up and show yourself. See! he’s a man!
1st. W. O, this is why you mocked and jeered us so!
And dared defend Euripides like that!
O, villain, villain. . . .
Mn. Miserable me!
I’ve put my foot in it, and no mistake.
1st. W. What shall we do with him?
Cl. Surround him here,
And watch him shrewdly that he ’scape you not.
I’ll go at once and summon the police.

Cleisthenes goes out.

## Chorus

Light we our torches, my sisters,
and manfully girding our robes,
Gather them sternly about us,
and casting our mantles aside
On through the tents and the gangways,
and up by the tiers and the rows,
Eyeing, and probing, and trying,
where men would be likely to hide.

Now ’tis time, ’tis time, my sisters,
round and round and round to go,
Soft, with light and airy footfall,
creeping, peeping, high and low.
Look about in each direction,
make a rigid, close inspection,
Lest in any hole or corner,
other rogues escape detection.
Hunt with care, here and there,
Searching, spying, poking, prying,
up and down, and everywhere.

For if once the evil-doer we can see,
He shall soon be a prey to our vengeance to-day,
And to all men a warning he shall be
Of the terrible fate that is sure to await
The guilty sin-schemer and lawless blasphemer.
And then he shall find that the Gods are not blind
To what passes below;
Yea, and all men shall know
It is best to live purely, uprightly, securely,
It is best to do well,
And to practise day and night
what is orderly and right,
And in virtue and in honesty to dwell.

But if anyone there be who a wicked deed shall do
In his raving, and his raging,
and his madness, and his pride,
Every mortal soon shall see,
aye, and every woman too,
What a doom shall the guilty one betide.
For the wicked evil deed
shall be recompensed with speed,
The Avenger doth not tarry to begin,
Nor delayeth for a time,
but He searcheth out the crime,
And He punisheth the sinner in his sin.

Now we’ve gone through every corner,
every nook surveyed with care,
And there’s not another culprit
skulking, lurking anywhere.

Just as the chorus are concluding their search, Mnesilochus snatches the first woman’s baby from her arms, and takes refuge at the altar.

1st. W. Hoy! Hoy there! Hoy!
He’s got my child, he’s got my darling, O!
He’s snatched my little baby from my breast.
O, stop him, stop him! O, he’s gone. O! O!
Mn. Aye, weep! you ne’er shall dandle him again,
Unless you loose me. Soon shall these small limbs,
Smit with cold edge of sacrificial knife,
Incarnadine this altar.
1st. W. O! O! O!
Help, women, help me. Sisters, help, I pray.
Charge to the rescue, shout, and rout, and scout him.
Don’t see me lose my baby, my one pet.
Ch. Alas! Alas!
Mercy o' me! what do I see?
What can it be?
What, will deeds of shameless violence
never, never, never, end?
What’s the matter, what’s he up to,
what’s he doing now, my friend?
Mn. Doing what I hope will crush you
out of all your bold assurance.
Ch. Zounds, his words are very dreadful;
more than dreadful, past endurance.
1st. W. Yes, indeed, they’re very dreadful,
and he’s got my baby too.
Ch. Impudence rare! Look at him there,
Doing such deeds, and I vow and declare
Never minding or caring—
Mn. Or likely to care.
1st. W. Here you are come: here you shall stay,
Never again shall you wander away;
Wander away, glad to display
All the misdeeds you have done us to-day,
But dear you shall pay.
Mn. There at least I’m hoping, ladies,
I shall find your words untrue.
Ch. What God do you think his assistance will lend,
You wicked old man, to escort you away?
Mn. Aha, but I’ve captured your baby, my friend,
And I shan’t let her go, for the best you can say.
Ch. But no, by the Goddesses Twain,
Not long shall our threats be in vain,
Not long shall you flout at our pain.
Unholy your deeds, and you’ll find
That we shall repay you in kind,
And perchance you will alter your mind
When Fate, veering round like the blast,
In its clutches has seized you at last,
Very fast.

Comrades, haste, collect the brushwood:
pile it up without delay:
Pile it, heap it, stow it, throw it,
burn and fire and roast and slay.
1st. W. Come, Mania, come; let’s run and fetch the faggots.
(To Mnesilochus) Ah, wretch, you’ll be a cinder before night.
Mn. (Busily engaged in unpacking the baby)
With all my heart. Now I’ll undo these wrappers,
These *Cretan* long clothes; and remember, darling,
It’s all your mother that has served you thus.
What have we here? a flask, and not a baby!
A flask of wine, for all its Persian slippers.
O ever thirsty, ever tippling women,
O ever ready with fresh schemes for drink,
To vintners what a blessing: but to us
And all our goods and chattels what a curse!
1st. W. Drag in the faggots, Mania; pile them up.
Mn. Aye, pile away; but tell me, is this baby
Really your own?
1st. W. My very flesh and blood.
Mn. Your flesh and blood?
1st. W. By Artemis it is.
Mn. Is it a pint?
1st. W. O, what have you been doing?
O, you have stripped my baby of its clothes.
Poor tiny morsel!
Mn. (holding up a large bottle) Tiny?
1st. W. Yes, indeed.
Mn. What is its age? Three *Pitcher-feasts* or four?
1st. W. Well, thereabouts, a little over now.
Please give it back.
Mn. No thank you, not exactly.
1st. W. We’ll burn you then.
Mn. O, burn me by all means;
But anyhow I’ll sacrifice this victim.
1st. W. O! O! O!
Make me your victim, anything you like;
But spare the child.
Mn. A loving mother truly.
But this dear child must needs be sacrificed.
1st. W. My child! my child! give me the basin, Mania,
I’ll catch my darling’s blood at any rate.
Mn. And so you shall; I’ll not deny you that.

Puts the bottle to his lips and drains every drop, taking care that none shall fall into the basin which the first woman is holding underneath.

1st. W. You spiteful man! you most ungenerous man!
Mn. This skin, fair priestess, is your perquisite.
1st. W. What is my perquisite?
Mn. This skin, fair priestess.

Another woman, Critylla, now enters.

Critylla. O Mica, who has robbed thee of thy flower,
And snatched thy babe, thine only one, away?
1st. W. This villain here: but I’m so glad you’re come.
You see he doesn’t run away, while I
Call the police, with Cleisthenes, to help us.
Exit.
Mn. (soliloquizes) O me, what hope of safety still remains?
What plan? what stratagem? My worthy cousin,
Who first involved me in this dreadful scrape,
“He cometh not.” Suppose I send him word.
But how to send it? Hah, I know a trick
Out of his *Palamede*.¹ I’ll send a message
Written on oar-blades. Tush! I’ve got no oar-blades.
What shall I do for oar-blades? Why not send
These votive slabs instead? The very thing.
Oar-blades are wood, and slabs are wood. I’ll try.
(Writes, singing as he does so.)
Now for the trick; fingers be quick;
Do what you can for my notable plan.
Slab, have the grace to permit me to trace
Grooves with my knife on your beautiful face.
The tale of my woe it is yours for to show.
O, o, what a furrow! I never did see
Such a horrible “r” as I’ve made it to be.
Well, that must do; so fly away you,
Hither and thither, off, off, and away.
Do not delay for a moment, I pray.

All the actors leave the stage; but Mnesilochus is unable to leave, and Critylla remains to keep watch.

## Chorus

Now let us turn to the people,
our own panegyric to render.
Men never speak a good word,
never one, for the feminine gender,
Every one says we’re a Plague,
the source of all evils to man,
War, dissension, and strife.
Come, answer me this, if you can;
Why, if we’re really a Plague,
you’re so anxious to have us for wives;
And charge us not to be peeping,
nor to stir out of doors for our lives.
Isn’t it silly to guard
a Plague with such scrupulous care?
Zounds! how you rave, coming home,
if your poor little wife isn’t there.
Should you not rather be glad,
and rejoice all the days of your life,
Rid of a Plague, you know,
the source of dissension and strife?
If on a visit we sport,
and sleep when the sporting is over,
O, how you rummage about;
what a fuss, your lost Plague to discover.
Every one stares at your Plague
if she happens to look on the street:
Stares all the more if your Plague
thinks proper to blush and retreat.
Is it not plain then, I ask,
that Women are really the best?
What, can you doubt that we are?
I will bring it at once to the test.
We say Women are best;
you men (just like you) deny it,
Nothing on earth is so easy
as to come to the test, and to try it.
I’ll take the name of a Man,
and the name of a Woman, and show it.
Did not *Charminus* give way
to *Miss-Fortune*? Do you not know it?
Is not *Cleophon* viler
than vile *Salabaccho* by far?
Is there a Man who can equal,
in matters of glory and war,
*Lady Victoria*, Mistress
of *Marathon*, queen of the Sea?
Is not *Prudence* a Woman,
and who is so clever as she?
Certainly none of your statesmen,
who only a twelvemonth ago
Gave up their place and their duty.
Would women demean themselves so?
Women don’t ride in their coaches,
as Men have been doing of late,
Pockets and purses distended
with cash they have filched from the State.
We, at the very outside,
steal a wee little jorum of corn,
Putting it back in the even,
whatever we took in the morn.

But this is a true description of you.
Are ye not gluttonous, vulgar, perverse,
Kidnappers, housebreakers, footpads, and worse?
And we in domestic economy too
Are thriftier, shiftier, wiser than you.
For the loom which our mothers
employed with such skill,
With its *Shafts* and its *Thongs*,
we are working it still.
And the ancient umbrella by no means is done,
We are wielding it yet,
as our *Shield from the Sun*.
But O for the *Shafts*,
and the *Thong* of the *Shield*,
Which your Fathers in fight
were accustomed to wield.
Where are they to-day?
Ye have cast them away
As ye raced, in hot haste,
and disgraced, from the fray!

Many things we have against you,
many rules we justly blame;
But the one we now will mention
is the most enormous shame.
What, my masters! ought a lady,
who has borne a noble son,
One who in your fleets and armies
great heroic deeds has done,
Ought she to remain unhonoured?
ought she not, I ask you, I,
In our *Stenia* and our *Scira*²
still to take precedence high?
Whoso breeds a cowardly soldier,
or a seaman cold and tame.
Crop her hair, and seat her lowly;
brand her with the marks of shame;
Set the nobler dame above her.
Can it, all ye Powers, be right
That *Hyperbolus’s* mother,
flowing-haired, and robed in white,
Should in public places sit by
*Lamachus’s* mother’s side,
Hoarding wealth, and lending monies,
gathering profits far and wide?
Sure ’twere better every debtor,
calm, resolving not to pay,
When she comes exacting money,
with a mild surprise should say,
Keeping principal and income, “You to claim
percentage due!
Sure a son so capital is capital enough for you.”

The close of the *Parabasis* finds the position of Mnesilochus unaltered. The dispatch of the tablets has, so far, produced no result.

Mn. I’ve strained my eyes with watching; but my poet,
“He cometh not.” Why not? Belike he feels
Ashamed of his old frigid *Palamede*.
Which is the play to fetch him? O, I know;
Which but his brand-new *Helen*? I’ll be *Helen*.
I’ve got the woman’s clothes, at all events.
Cr. What are you plotting? What is that you’re muttering?
I’ll *Helen* you, my master, if you don’t
Keep quiet there till the policeman comes.
Mn. (as *Helen*) “These are the fair-nymphed waters of the Nile,
Whose floods bedew, in place of heavenly showers,
Egypt’s white plains and black-dosed citizens.”
Cr. Sweet-shining Hecate, what a rogue it is.
Mn. “Ah, not unknown my Spartan fatherland,
Nor yet my father Tyndareus.”
Cr. My gracious!
Was he your father? Sure, Phrynondas was.
Mn. “And I was Helen.”
Cr. What, again a woman?
You’ve not been punished for your first freak yet.
Mn. “Full many a soul, by bright *Scamander’s* stream,
Died for my sake.”
Cr. Would yours had died among them!
Mn. “And now I linger here; but *Menelaus*,
My dear, dear lord, ah wherefore comes he not?
O sluggish crows, to spare my hapless life!
But soft! some hope is busy at my heart,
A laughing hope—O Zeus, deceive me not.”

Euripides enters disguised as *Menelaus*.

Eu. Who is the lord of this stupendous pile?
Will he extend his hospitable care
To some poor storm-tossed, shipwrecked mariners?
Mn. “These are the halls of *Proteus*.”
Eu. *Proteus*, are they!
Cr. O, by the Twain, he lies like anything.
I knew old *Proteus*; he’s been dead these ten years.
Eu. “Then whither, whither have we steered our bark?”
Mn. “To Egypt.”
Eu. “O, the weary, weary way!”
Cr. Pray don’t believe one single word he says.
This is the holy temple of the Twain.
Eu. “Know you if *Proteus* be at home or not?”
Cr. Why, don’t I tell you, he’s been dead these ten years!
You can’t have quite got over your sea-sickness,
Asking if *Proteus* be at home or not.
Eu. “Woe’s me! is *Proteus* dead? and where’s he buried?”
Mn. “This is his tomb whereon I’m sitting now.”
Cr. O, hang the rascal; and he shall be hanged!
How dare he say this altar is a tomb?
Eu. “And wherefore sitt’st thou on this monument,
Veiled in thy mantle, lady?”
Mn. “They compel me,
A weeping bride, to marry *Proteus’* son.”
Cr. Why do you tell the gentleman such fibs?
Good gentleman, he’s a bad man; he came
Among the women here, to steal their trinkets.
Mn. “Aye, aye, rail on: revile me as you list.”
Eu. “Who is the old woman who reviles you, lady?”
Mn. “*Theonoe*, *Proteus’* daughter.”
Cr. What a story!
Why, I’m Critylla, of *Gargettus*, sir,
A very honest woman.
Mn. “Aye, speak on.
But never will I wed thy brother, no,
I won’t be false to absent *Menelaus*.”
Eu. “What, lady, what? O, raise those orbs to mine.”
Mn. “O sir, I blush to raise them, with these cheeks.”
Eu. “O dear, O dear, I cannot speak for trembling.
Ye Gods, is’t possible? Who art thou, lady?”
Mn. “O, who art thou? I feel the same myself.”
Eu. “Art thou Hellenic, or a born Egyptian?”
Mn. “Hellenic, O, tell me what art thou.”
Eu. “O surely, surely, thou art *Helen’s* self.”
Mn. “O, from the greens thou must be *Menelaus*.”
Eu. “Yes, yes, you see that miserable man.”
Mn. “O, long in coming to these longing arms,
O, carry me, carry me, from this place,
O, wrap me in thy close embrace,
O, carry me, carry me, carry me home,
by this fond and loving kiss,
O, take me, take me, take me hence.”
Cr. I say now, none of this.
Let go there, or I’ll strike you with this link!
Eu. “Let go my wife, the child of Tyndareus,
Not take her home to Sparta? O, what mean you?”
Cr. O, that’s it, is it? You’re a bad one too!
Both of one gang. That’s what your gipsying meant!
But he at any rate shall meet his due.
Here’s the policeman, and the Scythian coming.
Eu. Ah, this won’t do: I must slip off awhile.
Mn. And what am I to do?
Eu. Keep quiet here,
Be sure I’ll never fail you while I live;
I have ten thousand tricks to save you yet.
Mn. Well, you caught nothing by that haul, I think.

The high official, who is here inadequately called “a policeman,” now enters upon the stage, attended by one of the Scythian archers.

Policeman. O archer, here’s the vagabond, of whom Cleisthenes told us.
(to Mnesilochus) Why do you hang your head?
(to Scythian) Take him within; there tie him on the plank;
Then bring him here and watch him. Let not any
Approach too near him: should they try to, take
The whip, and smite them.
Cr. Aye, one came but now
Spinning his yarns, and all but got him off.
Po. What should I grant you?
Mn. Don’t expose me thus;
Do tell the Scythian he may strip me first;
Don’t let a poor old man, in silks and snoods,
Provoke the laughter of the crows that eat him.
Po. Thus hath the Council ordered it, that so
The passers-by may see the rogue you are.
Mn. Alas! alas! O yellow silk, I hate ye!
O, I’ve no hope, no hope of getting free.

All the actors leave the stage. And the chorus commence their great ceremonial worship of dance and song.

## Chorus

Now for the revels, my sisters,
which we to the great Twain Powers
Prayerfully, carefully raise,
in the holy festival hours.
And *Pauson* will join in our worship to-day,
And *Pauson* will join in the fasting,
And, keen for the fast, to the Twain he will pray
For the rite to be made everlasting, I ween,
For the rite to be made everlasting.

Now advance
In the whirling, twirling dance,
With hand linked in hand, as we deftly trip along,
Keeping time to the cadence
of the swiftly-flowing song;
And be sure as we go
That we dart careful glances,
up and down, and to and fro.

Now ’tis ours
To entwine our choicest flowers,
Flowers of song and adoration
to the great Olympian Powers.
Nor expect
That the garland will be flecked
With abuse of mortal men;
such a thought is incorrect.
For with prayer
And with sacred loving care,
A new and holy measure we will heedfully prepare.

To the high and holy Minstrel³
Let the dancers onward go,
And to *Artemis*, the maiden
Of the quiver and the bow;
O, hear us, *Far-controller*, and the victory bestow.
And we trust our merry music
Will the matron Hera please,
For she loves the pleasant Chorus
And the dances such as these,
—Wearing at her girdle
The holy nuptial keys.

To *Pan* and pastoral *Hermes*
And the friendly *Nymphs* we pray,
That they smile with gracious favour
On our festival to-day,
With their laughter-loving glances
beaming brightly on our Play,
As we dance the *Double chorus*
To the old familiar strain,
As we weave our ancient pastime
On our holy day again,
—Keeping fast and vigil
In the Temple of the Twain.

Turn the step, and change the measure,
Raise a loftier music now;
Come, the *Lord of wine and pleasure*,
*Evoi*, *Bacchus*, lead us thou!
Yea, for Thee we adore!
Child of *Semele*, thee
With thy glittering ivy-wreaths,
Thee with music and song
Ever and ever we praise.
Thee with thy wood-nymphs delightedly singing,
Evoi! Evoi! Evoi!
Over the joyous hills
the sweet strange melody ringing
Hark! *Cithaeron* resounds,
Pleased the notes to prolong;
Hark! the bosky ravines
And the wild slopes thunder and roar,
Volleying back the song.
Round thee the ivy fair
With delicate tendril twines.

The Scythian brings Mnesilochus in, fastened to his plank, and sets it up on the stage.

Scythian. Dere now bemoan ye to de ouder air.
Mn. O, I entreat you.
Sc. Nod endread me zu.
Mn. Slack it a little.
Sc. Dat is vat I does.
Mn. O mercy! mercy! O, you drive it tighter.
Sc. Dighder zu wiss him?
Mn. Miserable me!
Out on you, villain.
Sc. Zilence, bad ole man.
I’se fetch de mat, an' vatch zu comfibly.
Mn. These are the joys Euripides has brought me!

Euripides makes a momentary appearance in the character of *Perseus*.

Mn. O Gods! O Saviour Zeus! there’s yet a hope.
Then he won’t fail me! Out he flashed as *Perseus*.
I understand the signals, I’m to act
The fair *Andromeda* in chains. Ah, well,
Here are the chains, worse luck, wherewith to act her.
He’ll come and succour me; he’s in the wings.
(Euripides enters singing airily.)
Eu. Now to peep, now to creep
Soft and slily through.
Maidens, pretty maidens,
Tell me what I am to do.
Tell me how to glide
By the *Scythian Argus-eyed*,
And to steal away my bride.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tell me, tell,
Echo, always lurking in the cavern and the dell.

Euripides retires, and Mnesilochus commences a Euripidean monody, mostly composed of quotations from the *Andromeda* adapted to his own position.

Mn. “A cold unpitying heart had he
Who bound me here in misery.
Hardly escaped from mouldy dame,
I’m caught and done for, just the same
Lo, the Scythian guard beside me,
Friendless, helpless, here he tied me;

# *Thesmophoriazusae* by Aristophanes (Part 3 of 3)

Soon upon these limbs of mine
Shall the greedy ravens dine.

Seest thou? Not to me belong
Youthful pleasures, dance and song,

Never, never more shall I
With my friends sweet law-suits try,

But woven chains with many a link surround me,
Till Glaucetes, that ravening whale, has found me.
Home I nevermore shall see;
Bridal songs are none for me,
Nought but potent incantations;
Sisters, raise your lamentations,
Woe, woe, woeful me,
Sorrow, and trouble, and misery,
Weeping, weeping, endless weeping,
Far from home and all I know,
Praying him who wronged me so.
O! O! Woe! woe!
First with razor keen he hacks me,
Next in yellow silk he packs me,
Sends me then to dangerous dome,
Where the women prowl and roam.
O heavy Fate! O fatal blow!
O woeful lot! and lots of woe!
O, how they will chide me,
and gibe, and deride me!
And O that the flashing, and roaring, and dashing
Red bolt of the thunder
might smite me in sunder—
The Scythian who lingers beside me!

For where is the joy of the sunshine and glow
To one who is lying, distracted and dying,
With throat-cutting agonies
riving him, driving him
Down, down to the darkness below.”

*A voice is heard from behind the scenes. It is the voice of ECHO.*

**Echo.** O welcome, daughter; but the Gods destroy
Thy father Cepheus, who exposed thee thus.

**Mn.** O, who art thou that mournest for my woes?

**Ec.** Echo, the vocal mocking-bird of song,
I who, last year, in these same lists contended,
A faithful friend, beside Euripides.
And now, my child, for thou must play thy part,
Make dolorous wails.

**Mn.** And you wail afterwards?

**Ec.** I’ll see to that; only begin at once.

**Mn.** “O Night most holy,
O’er dread Olympus, vast and far,
In thy dark car
Thou journeyest slowly
Through Ether ridged with many a star.”

**Ec.** “With many a star.”

**Mn.** “Why on Andromeda ever must flow
Sorrow and woe?”

**Ec.** Sorrow and woe?

**Mn.** “Heavy of fate.”

**Ec.** Heavy of fate.

**Mn.** Old woman, you’ll kill me, I know, with your prate.

**Ec.** Know with your prate.

**Mn.** Why, how tiresome you are: you are going too far.

**Ec.** You are going too far.

**Mn.** Good friend, if you kindly will leave me in peace,
You’ll do me a favour, O prithee, cease.

**Ec.** Cease.

**Mn.** O, go to the crows!

**Ec.** O, go to the crows!

**Mn.** Why can’t you be still?

**Ec.** Why can’t you be still?

**Mn.** (*spitefully*) Old gossip!

**Ec.** (*spitefully*) Old gossip!

**Mn.** Lackaday!

**Ec.** Lackaday!

**Mn.** And alas!

**Ec.** And alas!

*The Scythian suddenly awakes to the fact that his prisoner is taking part in a conversation.*

**Sc.** O, vat does you say?

**Ec.** O, vat does you say?

**Sc.** I'se calls de police.

**Ec.** I'se calls de police.

**Sc.** Vat nonsense is dis?

**Ec.** Vat nonsense is dis?

**Sc.** Vy, vere is de voice?

**Ec.** Vy, vere is de voice?

**Sc.** (*to Mnesilochus*) Vos it you?

**Ec.** Vos it you?

**Sc.** You'll catch it.

**Ec.** You'll catch it.

**Sc.** Does you mock?

**Ec.** Does you mock?

**Mn.** ’Tisn’t I, I declare: it is that woman there.

**Ec.** It is that woman there.

**Sc.** Vy, vere is de wretch?
Me must catch, me must catch.
Her's a gone, her's a fled.

**Ec.** Her's a gone, her's a fled.

**Sc.** You'll a suffer for dis.

**Ec.** You'll a suffer for dis.

**Sc.** Vat again?

**Ec.** Vat again?

**Sc.** Seize hold o' de miss.

**Ec.** Seize hold o' de miss.

**Sc.** Vat a babbling an' talketing woman.

*Euripides enters in the guise of Perseus.*

**Eu.** “Ah me, what wild and terrible coast is this?
Plying the pathless air with winged feet,
Steering for Argos, bearing in my hand
The Gorgon’s head—”

**Sc.** Vat dat you say o' Gorgo?
Dat you has got de right Gorgo’s head?

**Eu.** “Gorgon,” I say.

**Sc.** An' me says “Gorgo” too.

**Eu.** “Alas, what crag is this, and lashed upon it
What maiden, beautiful as shapes divine,
A lovely craft too rudely moored?”

**Mn.** “O stranger,
Pity the sorrows of a poor young woman,
And loose my bonds.”

**Sc.** Vat, will you no be quiet?
Vat, talkee, talkee, ven you're goin' to die?

**Eu.** “Fair girl, I weep to see thee hanging there.”

**Sc.** Disn't von gal: dis von ole villain man,
Von very bad rascal fellow.

**Eu.** Scythian, peace!
This is Andromeda, King Cepheus’ daughter.

**Sc.** Von daughter! Dis? Very obvious man, methinks.

**Eu.** O, reach thy hand, and let me clasp my love;
O Scythian, reach. Ah me, what passionate storms
Toss in men’s souls; and as for mine, O lady,
Thou art my love!

**Sc.** Me not admire your taste.
Still you may kiss her, if you wish it, dere.

**Eu.** “Hard-hearted Scythian, give me up my love,
And I will take her—take her aye to wife.”

**Sc.** Kiss her, me says; me not object to dat.

**Eu.** Ah me, I’ll loose her bonds.

**Sc.** You better not.

**Eu.** Ah me, I will.

**Sc.** Then, I'll cut off your head.
Me draw de cutlass, and you die, you dead.

**Eu.** “Ah, what avails me? Shall I make a speech?
His savage nature could not take it in.
True wit and wisdom were but labour lost
On such a rude barbarian. I must try
Some more appropriate, fitter stratagem.”

*He goes out.*

**Sc.** O, de vile fox! He joked me very near.

**Mn.** O, Perseus, Perseus, wilt thou leave me so?

**Sc.** Vat, does you askin' for de whip again?

## Chorus

Pallas we call upon,
Chastest and purest one,
Maiden and Virgin, our
Revels to see:
Guarding our portals
Alone of Immortals,
Mightily, potently,
Keeping the key.
Hater of Tyranny,
Come, for we call thee, we
Women in Chorus.
Bring Peace again with thee,
Jocundly, merrily,
Long to reign o’er us.
Sacred, unearthly ones,
Awfullest Shades,
Graciously, peacefully,
Come to your glades.
Man must not gaze on the
Rites at your shrine,
Torch-glimmer flashing o’er
Features divine.
Come, for we’re pouring
Imploring, adoring,
Intense veneration;
Dawn on your worshippers,
Givers of Home and our
Civilization.

*Euripides comes in, dressed as an old music-woman.*

**Eu.** Ladies, I offer terms. If well and truly
Your honourable sex befriend me now,
I won’t abuse your honourable sex
From this time forth forever. This I offer.

**Ch.** (*suspiciously*) But what’s your object in proposing this?

**Eu.** That poor old man there, he’s my poor old cousin.
Let him go free, and nevermore will I
Traduce your worthy sex; but if you won’t,
I’ll meet your husbands coming from the Wars,
And put them up to all your goings-on.

**Ch.** We take your terms, so far as we’re concerned,
But you yourself must manage with the Scythian.

**Eu.** I’ll manage him. Now, Hop-o’-my-thumb, come forward,

*A dancing-girl enters.*

And mind the things I taught you on the way.
Hold up your frock: skip lightly through the dance.
The Persian air, Teredon, if you please.

**Sc.** Vy, vat dis buzz-buzz? revels come dis vay?

**Eu.** She’s going to practise, Scythian, that is all.
She’s got to dance in public by-and-by.

**Sc.** Yesh, practice, yesh. Hoick! how she bobs about!
Now here, now dere: von flea upon de blanket.

**Eu.** Just stop a moment; throw your mantle off;
Come, sit you down beside the Scythian here,
And I’ll unloose your slippers. That will do.
We must be moving homeward.

**Sc.** May I kiss her?

**Eu.** Once, only once.

**Sc.** (*kissing her*) O, O, vat very sweet kiss!
Dat's very much sweeter dan your Attic honies.
Do let me kiss her second time, ole lady.

**Eu.** No, Scythian, no; we really can’t allow it.

**Sc.** O doozy, doozy, dear ole lady, doozy.

**Eu.** Will you give silver for one kiss?

**Sc.** Yesh! yesh!

**Eu.** Well, p’raps on that consideration, Scythian,
We won’t object; but give the silver first.

**Sc.** Silver? Vy, vere? I'se got none. Take dis bow-case.
You, vat I call you?

**Eu.** Artemisia.

**Sc.** Yesh. Artemisia.

**Eu.** Hillo, what’s that? She’s off.

**Sc.** I'se fetch her back; you, look to bad ole man.

*Hop-o’-my-thumb runs out. The Scythian flings his bow-case to Euripides and runs after her.*

**Eu.** O tricky Hermes, you befriend me still.
Good-bye, old Scythian; catch her if you can.
Meanwhile I’ll free your prisoner: and do you
(*to Mnesilochus*) Run like a hero, when I’ve loosed your bonds,
Straight to the bosom of your family.

**Mn.** Trust me for that, so soon as these are off.

**Eu.** There then, they are off: now run away, before
The Scythian come and catch you.

**Mn.** Won’t I just!

*Euripides and Mnesilochus leave the stage. They are hardly out of sight when the Scythian returns.*

**Sc.** Ole lady, here's—vy, vere's ole lady vanished?
Vere's dat ole man? O bah, I smells de trick.
Ole lady, dis very bad o' you, ole lady!
Me not expect dis of you. Bad ole lady.
Artemisia!
Bow-cases? Yesh, you von big hocus-pocus.
Vat shall I does? vere can ole lady is?
Artemisia!

**Ch.** Mean you the ancient dame who bore the lute?

**Sc.** Yesh, does you saw her?

**Ch.** Yes, indeed I did.
She went that way: there was an old man with her.

**Sc.** Von yellow-silk ole man?

**Ch.** Exactly so.
I think you’ll catch them if you take that road.

**Sc.** Very bad ole lady, did she which way run?
Artemisia!

**Ch.** Straight up the hill; no, no, not that direction.

*They are of course misdirecting him; notwithstanding which, he seems lively, in his flurry, to stumble on the right road.*

You’re going wrong: see, that’s the way she went.

**Sc.** O dear, O dear, but Artemisia runs.

*He runs out the wrong way.*

**Ch.** Merrily, merrily, merrily on
to your own confusion go.

But we’ve ended our say,
and we’re going away.
Like good honest women,
straight home from the Play.
And we trust that the twain-Home-givers will deign
To bless with success our performance today.
