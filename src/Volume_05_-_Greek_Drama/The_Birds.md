*A desolate scene, with a tree and a rock. Enter Peisthetaerus, carrying a crow, and Euelpides, carrying a jackdaw.*

**Euelpides.** Straight on do you bid me go, where the
tree stands?

**Peisthetaerus.** Oh hang it all! mine's croaking back
again.

**Eu.** Why are we wandering up and down, you
rogue?
This endless spin will make an end of us.

**Pe.** To think that I, poor fool, at a crow's bidding,
Should trudge about, an hundred miles and more!

**Eu.** To think that I, poor wretch, at a daw's bidding,
Should wear the very nails from off my feet!

**Pe.** Why, where we are, I've not the least idea.

**Eu.** Could you from hence find out your fatherland?

**Pe.** No, that would pose even—Execestides!

**Eu.** Oh, here's a nuisance!

**Pe.** Go you there, then, friend.

**Eu.** I call Philocrates a regular cheat,
The fool that sells the bird-traps in the market.
He swore these two would lead us straight to Tereus,
The hoopoe, made a bird in that same market.[^1]
So then this daw, this son of Tharreleides,
We bought for an obol, and that crow for three.
But what knew they? Nothing, but how to—bite!
Where are you gaping now? Do you want to lead us
Against the rocks? There's no road here, I tell you.

**Pe.** No, nor yet here; not even the tiniest path.

**Eu.** Well, but what says your crow about the road?

**Pe.** By Zeus, she croaks quite differently now.

**Eu.** (*shouting*) What does she say about the road?

**Pe.** She says
She'll gnaw my fingers off; that's all she says.

**Eu.** Now isn't it a shame that when we are here
Ready and willing as two men can be
To go to the ravens, we can't find the way.
For we are sick, spectators, with a sickness
Just the reverse of that which Sacas has.
He, no true townsman, would perforce press in;
Whilst we, with rights of tribe and race unchallenged,
Townsmen mid townsmen, no man scaring us,
Spread both our—feet, and flew away from home.
Not that we hate our city, as not being
A prosperous mighty city, free for all
To spend their wealth in, paying fines and fees.
Aye, the cicalas chirp upon the boughs
One month, or two; but our Athenians chirp
Over their lawsuits all their whole life long.
That's why we are journeying on this journey now,
Trudging along with basket, pot, and myrtles,
To find some quiet easy-going spot,
Where we may settle down, and dwell in peace.
Tereus, the hoopoe, is our journey's aim,
To learn if he, in any place he has flown to,
Has seen the sort of city that we want.

**Pe.** You there!

**Eu.** What now?

**Pe.** My crow keeps croaking upwards
Ever so long.

**Eu.** And here's my jackdaw gaping
Up in the air, as if to show me something.
There must be birds about, I am sure of that.
Let's make a noise and we shall soon find out.

**Pe.** Then harkye; bang your leg against the rock.

**Eu.** And you, your head; and there'll be twice the
noise.

**Pe.** Well, take a stone and knock.

**Eu.** Yes, I'll do that.
Boy! Boy!

**Pe.** Eh! What! do you call the hoopoe "Boy"?
You should call "Whoop-ho there," not "Boy" of
course.

**Eu.** Oh, Whoop-ho there! What, must I knock
again? Whoop-ho!

*A door opens in the rock, and an actor emerges, with a headdress representing the head of a Dunlin or plover-page with a long and wide gaping beak. Peisthetaerus and Euelpides stumble back, and Peisthetaerus falls; their birds escape.*

**Plover-Page.** Whoever are these? Who calls my
master?

**Eu.** Apollo shield us, what a terrible gape!

**Plover-Page.** These be two bird-catchers. Oh dear, oh dear!

**Eu.** (*aside*) As nasty-speaking, as unpleasant-looking!

**Plover-Page.** Ye shall both die!

**Eu.** Oh, we're not men.

**Plover-Page.** What then?

**Eu.** Well, I'm the Panic-struck, a Libyan bird.

**Plover-Page.** Nonsense!

**Eu.** No nonsense: look for yourself and see.

**Plover-Page.** And he—what bird is he? come, won't you
answer?

**Pe.** I? I'm a pheasant, and a yellow-tailed one.

**Eu.** But oh by all the Gods, whatever are you?

**Plover-Page.** A serving-bird.

**Eu.** What, vanquished by some gamecock
In fight?

**Plover-Page.** No, but my master, when he first
Became a hoopoe, prayed that I might turn
Into a bird, to be his servant still.

**Eu.** What, does a bird require a serving-bird?

**Plover-Page.** He does, as having been a man, I fancy.
So when he wants to taste Phaleric sardines,
I run for the sardines, catching up a dish.
Does he want soup? then where's the pot and ladle?
I run for the ladle.

**Eu.** A regular running-page.
Now harkye, Plover-page, run in and call
Your master out.

**Plover-Page.** Great Zeus! he has just been eating
Myrtles and midges, and is gone to roost.

**Eu.** But still, do wake him.

**Plover-Page.** Well, I know he won't
Like to be waked, still for your sake I'll do it.

*Exit the PLOVER-PAGE.*

**Pe.** Confound the bird! he frightened me to death.

**Eu.** Oh dear! Oh dear! my heart went pit-a-pat,
My daw's gone too.

**Pe.** (*severely*) Gone! Oh you coward you,
You let him go!

**Eu.** Well, didn't you fall down,
And let your crow go?

**Pe.** No, I didn't. No!

**Eu.** Where is she then?

**Pe.** She flew away herself.

**Eu.** You didn't let her go. You're a brave boy!

*Enter Hoopoe upon the platform, which bears a small coppice in which his wife the Nightingale lies asleep. The Hoopoe has no feathers except on head and and wings.*

**Hoopoe.** Throw wide the wood, that I may issue
forth!

**Eu.** Oh Heracles, why what in the world is this?
What feathering's here? What style of triple-cresting?

**Ho.** Who be the folk that seek me?

**Eu.** The Twelve Gods
Would seem to have wrought your ruin.

**Ho.** What, do you jeer me,
Seeing the way I'm feathered? Strangers, I
Was once a man.

**Eu.** It's not at you we're laughing.

**Ho.** What is it then?

**Eu.** Your beak looks rather funny.

**Ho.** This is the way that Sophocles disfigures
The manly form of Tereus in his play.

**Eu.** What, are you Tereus? Are you bird or
peacock?

**Ho.** I am a bird.

**Eu.** Then, where are all your feathers?

**Ho.** They've fallen off!

**Eu.** What! from disease, or why?

**Ho.** No, but in winter-time all birds are wont
To moult their feathers, and then fresh ones grow.
But tell me what ye are.

**Eu.** We? mortal men.

**Ho.** And of what race?

**Eu.** Whence the brave galleys come.

**Ho.** Not dicasts, are ye?

**Eu.** No, the other sort.
We're anti-dicasts.

**Ho.** Grows that seedling there?

**Eu.** Aye, in the country you can find a few,
If you search closely.

**Ho.** But what brings you hither?

**Eu.** To talk with you a little.

**Ho.** What about?

**Eu.** You were a man at first, as we are now,
And had your creditors, as we have now,
And loved to shirk your debts, as we do now;
And then you changed your nature, and became
A bird, and flew round land and sea, and know
All that men feel, and all that birds feel too.
That's why we are come as suppliants here, to ask
If you can tell us of some city, soft
As a thick rug, to lay us down within.

**Ho.** Seek ye a mightier than the Cranaan town?

**Eu.** A mightier, no; a more commodious, yes.

**Ho.** Aristocratic?

**Eu.** Anything but that!
I loathe the very name of Scellias' son.[^1]

**Ho.** What sort of city would ye like?

**Eu.** Why, one
Where my worst trouble would be such as this;
A friend at daybreak coming to my door
And calling out, "Oh by Olympian Zeus,
Take your bath early: then come round to me,
You and your children, to the wedding banquet
I'm going to give. Now pray don't disappoint me,
Else, keep your distance, when my money's—
gone."

**Ho.** Upon my word, you are quite in love with
troubles!
And you?

**Pe.** I love the like.

**Ho.** But tell me what.

**Pe.** To have the father of some handsome lad
Come up and chide me with complaints like these,
"Fine things I hear of you, Stilbonides,
You met my son returning from the baths,
And never kissed, or hugged, or fondled him,
You, his paternal friend! You're a nice fellow."

**Ho.** Poor Poppet, you are in love with ills indeed.
Well, there's the sort of city that ye want
By the Red Sea.

**Eu.** Not by the sea! Not where
The Salaminian, with a process-server
On board, may heave in sight some early morn.
But can't you mention some Hellenic town?

**Ho.** Why don't ye go and settle down in Elis,
At Lepreus?

**Eu.** Leprous! I was never there,
But for Melanthius' sake I loathe the name.

**Ho.** Well then, the Opuntians up in Locris, there's
The place to dwell in!

**Eu.** I become Opuntius!
No thank you, no, not for a talent of gold.
But this, this bird-life here, you know it well,
What is this like?

**Ho.** A pleasant life enough.
Foremost and first you don't require a purse.

**Eu.** There goes a grand corrupter of our life!

**Ho.** Then in the gardens we enjoy the myrtles,
The cress, the poppy, the white sesame.

**Eu.** Why, then, ye live a bridegroom's jolly life.

**Pe.** Oh! Oh!
Oh the grand scheme I see in the birds' reach,
And power to grasp it, if ye'd trust to me!

**Ho.** Trust you in what?

**Pe.** What? First don't fly about
In all directions, with your mouths wide open.
That makes you quite despised. With us, for instance,
If you should ask the flighty people there,
"Who is that fellow?" Teleas would reply,
"The man's a bird, a flighty feckless bird,
Inconsequential, always on the move."

**Ho.** Well blamed, i'faith; but what we ought to do,
Tell us.

**Pe.** Live all together: found one State.

**Ho.** What sort of State are birds to found, I wonder.

**Pe.** Aye, say you so? You who have made the most
Idiotic speech, look down.

**Ho.** I do.

**Pe.** Look up.

**Ho.** I do.

**Pe.** Twirl round your head.

**Ho.** Zeus! I shall be
A marvellous gainer, if I twist my neck!

**Pe.** What did you see?

**Ho.** I saw the clouds and sky.

**Pe.** And is not that the Station of the Birds?

**Ho.** Station?

**Pe.** As one should say, their habitation.
Here while the heavens revolve, and yon great dome
Is moving round, ye keep your Station still.
Make this your city, fence it round with walls,
And from your Station is evolved your State.
So ye'll be lords of men, as now of locusts,
And Melian famine shall destroy the Gods.

**Ho.** Eh! how?

**Pe.** The Air's betwixt the Earth and Sky.
And just as we, if we would go to Pytho,
Must crave a grant of passage from Boeotia,
Even so, when men slay victims to the Gods,
Unless the Gods pay tribute, ye in turn
Will grant no passage for the savoury steam
To rise through Chaos, and a realm not theirs.

**Ho.** Hurrah!
Oh Earth! ods traps, and nets, and gins, and snares,
This is the nattiest scheme that e'er I heard of!
So with your aid I'm quite resolved to found
The city, if the other birds concur.

**Pe.** And who shall tell them of our plan?

**Ho.** Yourself.
Oh they're not mere barbarians, as they were
Before I came. I've taught them language now.

**Pe.** But how to call them hither?

**Ho.** That's soon done.
I've but to step within the coppice here,
And wake my sleeping nightingale, and then
We'll call them, both together. Bless the birds,
When once they hear our voices, they'll come
running.

**Pe.** You darling bird, now don't delay one instant.
Oh I beseech you get at once within
Your little copse, and wake the nightingale!

**Ho.** Awake, my mate!
Shake off thy slumbers, and clear and strong
Let loose the floods of thy glorious song,
The sacred dirge of thy mouth divine
For sore-wept Itys, thy child and mine;
Thy tender trillings his name prolong
With the liquid note of thy tawny throat;
Through the leafy curls of the woodbine sweet
The pure sound mounts to the heavenly seat,
And Phoebus, lord of the golden hair,
As he lists to thy wild plaint echoing there,
Draws answering strains from his ivoried lyre,
Till he stirs the dance of the heavenly choir,
And calls from the blessed lips on high
Of immortal Gods, a divine reply
To the tones of thy witching melody.

*The sound of a flute is heard within, imitating the nightingale's song.*

**Eu.** Oh Zeus and King, the little birdie's voice!
Oh how its sweetness honied all the copse!

**Pe.** Hi!

**Eu.** Well?

**Pe.** Keep quiet.

**Eu.** Why?

**Pe.** The Hoopoe here
Is going to favour us with another song.

*The Bird-call by the Hoopoe and Nightingale conjointly; the Nightingale's song being imitated, as before, by the flute.*

**Ho.** Whoop-ho! Whoop-ho!
Whoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-hoop-ho!
Hoi! Hoi! Hoi! Come, come, come, come, come!

(The land-birds)
Come hither any bird with plumage like my own;
Come hither ye that batten on the acres newly sown,
On the acres by the farmer neatly sown;
And the myriad tribes that feed on the barley and the seed,
The tribes that lightly fly, giving out a gentle cry;
And ye who round the clod, in the furrow-riven sod,
With voices sweet and low, twitter, flitter to and fro,
Singing, "*Tio, tio, tio, tiotinx*";
And ye who in the gardens a pleasant harvest glean,
Lurking in the branches of the ivy ever green;
And ye who top the mountains with gay and airy flight;
And ye who in the olive and the arbutus delight;
Come hither one and all, come flying to our call,
"*Trioto, trioto, totobrinx*."

(The marsh-birds)
Ye that snap up the gnats, shrilly voiced,
Mid the deep water-glens of the fens,
Or on Marathon's expanse haunt the lea, fair to see,
Or career o'er the swamps, dewy-moist,
And the bird with the gay mottled plumes, come away,
Francolin! Francolin! come away!

(The sea-birds)
Ye with the halcyons flitting delightedly
Over the surge of the infinite Sea,
Come to the great Revolution awaiting us,
Hither, come hither, come hither to me.
Hither, to listen to wonderful words,
Hither we summon the taper-necked birds.
For hither has come a shrewd old file,
Such a deep old file, such a sharp old file,
His thoughts are new, new deeds he'll do,
Come here, and confer with this shrewd old file.
Come hither! Come hither! Come hither!
*Toro-toro-toro-torotinx!*
*Kikkabau, kikkabau!*
*Toro-toro-toro-toro-lililinx!*

**Pe.** See any bird?

**Eu.** By Apollo no, not I,
Though up I gaze with mouth and eyes wide open.

**Pe.** Methinks the Hoopoe played the lapwing's trick,
Went in the copse, and whooped, and whooped for
nothing.

**Ho.** *Torotinx! Torotinx.*

**Pe.** Comrade, here's a bird approaching,
Coming to receive our visit.

*Four birds pass before the audience, and disappear on the other side.*

**Eu.** Aye, by Zeus, what bird do you call it?
Surely not a peacock, is it?

**Pe.** That the Hoopoe here will teach us.
Prithee, friend, what bird is he?

**Ho.** That is not a common object,
Such as you can always see;
That's a marsh-bird.

**Eu.** Lovely creature! nice and red like flaming flame.

**Ho.** So he should be, for Flamingo
Is the lovely creature's name.

**Eu.** Hi there!

**Pe.** What? The row you're making!

**Eu.** Here's another, full in view.

**Pe.** Aye, by Zeus, another truly,
With a foreign aspect too.
Who is he, the summit-ascending,
Muse-prophetical, wondrous bird?

**Ho.** He's a Median.

**Pe.** He a Median! Heracles, the thing's
Absurd.
How on earth without a camel
Could a Median hither fly?

**Eu.** Here they're coming; here's another,
With his crest erected high.

**Pe.** Goodness gracious, that's a hoopoe;
Yes, by Zeus, another one!
Are not you the only Hoopoe?

**Ho.** I'm his grandsire; he's the son
Of the Philoclean hoopoe: as with you a name will pass,
Callias siring Hipponicus, Hipponicus Callias.

**Pe.** Oh then that is Callias, is it?
How his feathers moult away!

**Ho.** Aye, the simple, generous creature,
He's to parasites a prey;
And the females flock around him,
Plucking out his feathers too.

**Pe.** Oh Poseidon, here's another;
Here's a bird of brilliant hue!
What's the name of this, I wonder.

**Ho.** That's a Glutton styled by us.

**Pe.** Is there then another Glutton
Than our own Cleonymus?

**Eu.** Our Cleonymus, I fancy,
Would have thrown his crest away.

**Pe.** But what means the crest-equipment
Of so many birds, I pray?
Are they going to race in armour?

**Ho.** No, my worthy friend, they make
Each his dwelling, like the Carians,
On the crests for safety's sake.

*Enter chorus of twenty-four birds, all crowding together.*

**Pe.** Oh Poseidon, what the mischief!
See, the birds are everywhere
Fluttering onward.

**Eu.** King Apollo, what a cloud! Oh! Oh! look there,
Now we cannot see the entrance
For the numbers crowding in.

**Pe.** Here you see a partridge coming,
There by Zeus a francolin,
Here a widgeon onward hurries,
There's a halcyon, sure as fate.

**Eu.** Who's behind her?

**Pe.** That's a clipper; he's the lady halcyon's mate.

**Eu.** Can a clipper be a bird then?

**Pe.** Sporgilus is surely so.
Here's an owl.

**Eu.** And who to Athens brought an owl, I'd like to know.

**Pe.** Jay and turtle, lark and sedgebird,
Thyme-finch, ring-dove first, and then
Rock-dove, stock-dove, cuckoo, falcon,
Fiery-crest, and willow wren,
Lammergeyer, porphyrion, kestrel,
Waxwing, nuthatch, water-hen.

**Eu.** (*singing*) Oho for the birds, Oho! Oho!
Oho for the blackbirds, ho!
How they twitter, how they go,
Shrieking and screaming to and fro.
Goodness! are they going to charge us?
They are gazing here, and see
All their beaks they open widely.

**Pe.** That is what occurs to me.

**Chorus.** Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-where may he be
That was calling for me? In what locality
Pastureth he?

**Ho.** I am ready, waiting here;
Never from my friends I stir.

**Ch.** Te-te-te-te-te-te-te-te-teach me, I pray, in an
amicable way,
What is the news you have gotten to say.

**Ho.** News amazing! News auspicious!
News delightful, safe, and free!
Birds! Two men of subtlest genius
Hither have arrived to me.

**Ch.** Who! What! When! say that again.

**Ho.** Here, I say, have come two elders,
Travelling to the birds from man,
And the scheme they are bringing with them
Of a most stupendous plan.

**Ch.** You who have made the greatest error
Since my callow life began,
What do you say?

**Ho.** Now don't be nervous.

**Ch.** What is the thing you have done to me?

**Ho.** I've received two men, enamoured
Of your sweet society.

**Ch.** You have really dared to do it?

**Ho.** Gladly I the deed avow.

**Ch.** And the pair are now amongst us?

**Ho.** Aye, if I'm amongst you now.

**Ch.** Oh! Oh! Out upon you!
We are cheated and betrayed,
We have suffered shame and wrong!
For our comrade and our friend
Who has fed with us so long,
He has broken every oath, and his holy plighted troth,
And the old social customs of our clan.
He has led us unawares into wiles, and into snares,
He has given us a prey, all helpless and forlorn,
To those who were our foes
From the time that they were born,
To vile and abominable Man!
But for him, our bird-companion,
Comes a reckoning by and by;
As for these two old deceivers,
They shall suffer instantly,
Bit by bit we'll tear and rend them.

**Pe.** Here's a very horrid mess.

**Eu.** Wretched man, 'twas you that caused it,
You and all your cleverness!
Why you brought me I can't see.

**Pe.** Just that you might follow me.

**Eu.** Just that I might die of weeping.

**Pe.** What a foolish thing to say!
Weeping will be quite beyond you,
When your eyes are pecked away.

**Ch.** On! On! In upon them!
Make a very bloody onset,
Spread your wings about your foes,
Assail them and attack them,
And surround them and enclose.
Both, both of them shall die,
And their bodies shall supply
A rare dainty pasture for my beak.
For never shall be found any distant spot of ground,
Or shadowy mountain covert, or foamy Ocean wave,
Or cloud in Aether floating,
Which these reprobates shall save
From the doom that upon them I will wreak.
On then, on, my flying squadrons,
Now's the time to tear and bite,
Tarry ye not an instant longer.
Brigadier, advance our right.

**Eu.** Here it comes! I'm off, confound them.

**Pe.** Fool, why can't you remain with me?

**Eu.** What! that these may tear and rend me?

**Pe.** How can you hope from birds to flee?

**Eu.** Truly, I haven't the least idea.

**Pe.** Then it is I the affair must guide.
Seize we a pot and, the charge awaiting,
Here we will combat side by side.

**Eu.** Pot! and how can a pot avail us?

**Pe.** Never an owl will then come near.

**Eu.** What of these birds of prey with talons?

**Pe.** Snatch up a spit, like a hoplite's spear,
Planting it firmly there before you.

**Eu.** What shall I do about my eyes?

**Pe.** Take a platter, or take a saucer,
Holding it over them buckler-wise.

**Eu.** What a skilful neat contrivance!
Oh you clever fellow you,
In your military science Nicias you far outdo!

**Ch.** Eleleleu! advance! no loitering;
Level your beaks and charge away.
Shatter the pot at once to pieces;
Worry, and scratch, and tear, and flay!

**Ho.** Oh, whatever is your purpose? is your villainy so great,
You would slay two worthy persons,
Kinsmen, clansmen, of my mate?
Men who never sought to harm you,
Would you tear and lacerate?

**Ch.** Why, I wonder, should we spare them,
More than ravening beasts of prey?
Shall we ever find, for vengeance,
Enemies more rank than they?

**Ho.** Enemies, I grant, by nature,
Very friends in heart and will;
Here they come with kindly purpose,
Useful lessons to instil.

**Ch.** What, they come with words of friendship?
What, you really then suppose
They will teach us useful lessons,
They our fathers' fathers' foes?

**Ho.** Yet to clever folk a foeman
Very useful hints may show;
Thus, that foresight brings us safety,
From a friend we ne'er should know,
But the truth is forced upon us, very quickly, by a foe.
Hence it is that all the Cities,
Taught by foe, and not by friend,
Learn to build them ships of battle,
And their lofty walls extend;
So by this, a foeman's, teaching
Children, home, and wealth defend.

**Ch.** Well, I really think 'tis better
That their errand we should know;
I admit that something useful
May be taught us by a foe.

**Pe.** (*to Euelpides*) Now their anger grows more slack;
Now we had better just draw back.

**Ho.** (*to Chorus*) This is right and friendly conduct,
Such as I deserve from you.

**Ch.** Well, I am sure that we have never
Gone against you hitherto.

**Pe.** Now they are growing a deal more peaceful,
Now is the time the pot to ground,
Now we may lower the platters twain.
Nay, but the spit we had best retain,
Walking within the encampment's bound,
Letting our watchful glances skim
Over the edge of the pot's top rim;
Never a thought of flight must strike us.

**Eu.** Well, but tell me, suppose we die,
Where in the world will our bodies lie?

**Pe.** They shall be buried in Cerameicus,
That will be done at the public cost,
For we will say that our lives we lost
Gallantly fighting the public foe
(Yea, we will tell the commanders so),
Gallantly fighting at Orneae.

**Ch.** Fall back, fall back to your ranks once more,
And stand at ease as ye stood before,
And lay your wrath on the ground, in line
With your angry mood, as a warrior should;
We'll ask the while who the men may be,
And whence they come, and with what design.
Hey, Hoopoe, hey! to you I speak.

**Ho.** What is it that to learn you seek?

**Ch.** Whence are these visitors and who?

**Ho.** From clever Hellas strangers two.

**Ch.** What's their aim? Canst thou tell
Why they came
Here to dwell?

**Ho.** Love of you,
Love of your
Life and ways
Was the lure.
Here they fain
Would remain
Comrades true
All their days.

**Ch.** Hey, hey, what do you say?
What is the tale they tell?

**Ho.** In brief,
'Tis something more than past belief.

**Ch.** But wherefore is he come? What is it
He seeks to compass by his visit?
Think you he's got some cunning plan
Whereby, allied with us, he can
Assist a friend, or harm a foe?
What brings him here, I'd like to know.

**Ho.** Too great, too great, for thought or words,
The bliss he promises the birds.
All things are yours, he says, whate'er
Exists in space, both here and there,
And to and fro, and everywhere.

**Ch.** Mad a little, eh?

**Ho.** More sane than words can say.

**Ch.** Wide awake?

**Ho.** Wide as day.
The subtlest cunningest fox,
All scheme, invention, craft; wit, wisdom, paradox.

**Ch.** His speech, his speech, bid him begin it.
The things you show excite me, so,
I'm fit to fly this very minute.

**Ho.** Now you and you, take back this panoply,
And hang it up, God bless it, out of sight
Within the kitchen there, beside the Jack.
But you (*to Peisthetaerus*) the things we summoned them to hear
Expound, declare.

**Pe.** By Apollo no, not I,
Unless they pledge me such a treaty-pledge
As that small jackanapes who makes the swords
Pledged with his wife, to wit that they'll not bite me
Nor pull me about, nor scratch my—

**Ch.** Fie, for shame!
Not this? No, no!

**Pe.** My eyes, I was going to say.

**Ch.** I pledge it.

**Pe.** Swear!

**Ch.** I swear on these conditions;
So may I win by every judge's vote,
And the whole Theatre's.

**Pe.** And so you shall.

**Ch.** But if I'm false, then by one vote alone.

**Ho.** Oh yes! Oh yes! Hoplites, take up your arms
And march back homewards; there await the orders
We're going to publish on the notice-boards.

**Ch.** Full of wiles, full of guiles, at all times, in all ways,
Are the children of Men; still we'll hear what he says.
Thou hast haply detected
Something good for the Birds which we never suspected;
Some power of achievement, too high
For my own shallow wit by itself to descry.
But if aught you espy,
Tell it out; for whate'er of advantage shall fall
To ourselves by your aid, shall be common to all.
So expound us the plan you have brought us, my man,
Not doubting, it seems, of success.
And don't be afraid, for the treaty we made
We won't be the first to transgress.

**Pe.** I am hot to begin, and my spirit within
Is fermenting the tale to declare.
And my dough I will knead, for there's nought to impede.
Boy, bring me a wreath for my hair,
And a wash for my hands.

**Eu.** Why, what mean these commands?
Is a dinner in near contemplation?

**Pe.** No dinner, I ween; 'tis a speech that I mean,
A stalwart and brawny oration,
Their spirit to batter, and shiver and shatter.
(*To the birds*) So sorely I grieve for your lot
Who once in the prime and beginning of time
Were Sovereigns—

**Ch.** We Sovereigns! of what?

**Pe.** Of all that you see; of him and of me;
Of Zeus up above on his throne;

[^1]: The hoopoe is really an actor who has obtained his plumage in the bird-market, where these birds were also bought; they might therefore be expected to find him. Pandion of Athens had two daughters, Procne and Philomela; Tereus of Thrace married the one and outraged the other; the sisters killed his son Itys, and served him up for his father's dinner; he pursued them, and they were changed, Tereus into a hoopoe, Procne into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow. Aristocrates, chosen because of his name. He took part in the oligarchical revolution of the Four Hundred.

A lineage older and nobler by far
Than the Titans and Cronos ye own,
And than Earth.
Ch. And than Earth!
Pe. By Apollo ’tis true.
Ch. And I never had heard it before!
Pe. Because you’ve a blind, uninquisitive mind,
Unaccustomed on *Aesop* to pore.
The lark had her birth, so he says, before Earth;
Then her father fell sick and he died.
She laid out his body with dutiful care,
But a grave she could nowhere provide;
For the Earth was not yet in existence; at last,
By urgent necessity led,
When the fifth day arrived, the poor creature contrived
To bury her sire in her head.
Eu. So the sire of the lark, give me leave to remark,
On the crest of a headland lies dead.
Pe. If therefore, by birth, ye are older than Earth,
If before all the Gods ye existed,
By the right of the firstborn the sceptre is yours;
Your claim cannot well be resisted.
Eu. I advise you to nourish and strengthen your beak,
And to keep it in trim for a stroke.
Zeus won’t in a hurry the sceptre restore
To the woodpecker tapping the oak.
Pe. In times prehistoric ’tis easily proved,
By evidence weighty and ample,
That Birds, and not Gods, were the Rulers of men,
And the Lords of the world; for example,
Time was that the Persians were ruled by the Cock,
A King autocratic, alone;
The sceptre he wielded or ever the names
“Megabazus,” “Darius” were known;
And the “Persian” he still by the people is called
From the Empire that once was his own.
Eu. And thus, to this hour, the symbol of power
On his head you can always detect:
Like the Sovereign of Persia, alone of the Birds,
He stalks with tiara erect.
Pe. So mighty and great was his former estate,
So ample he waxed and so strong,
That still the tradition is potent, and still,
When he sings in the morning his song,
At once from their sleep all mortals upleap,
The cobblers, the tanners, the bakers,
The potters, the bathmen, the smiths, and the
Shield-and-the-musical-instrument-makers;
And some will at eve take their sandals and leave.
Eu. I can answer for that, to my cost.
’Twas all through his crowing at eve that my cloak,
The softest of Phrygians, I lost.
I was asked to the Tenth-day feast of a child;
And I drank ere the feast was begun;
Then I take my repose; and anon the cock crows;
So thinking it daybreak I run
To return from the City to Halimus town;
But scarce I emerge from the wall,
When I get such a whack with a stick on my back
From a rascally thief, that I fall,
And he skims off my cloak from my shoulders or e’er
For assistance I’m able to bawl.
Pe. Then a Kite was the Sovereign of Hellas of old,
And ruled with an absolute sway.
Ch. The Sovereign of Hellas!
Pe. And, taught by his rule,
We wallow on earth to this day
When a Kite we espy.
Eu. By Bacchus, ’twas I
Saw a Kite in the air; so I wallow
Then raising my eyne from my posture supine,
I give such a gulp that I swallow
O what but an obol I’ve got in my mouth,
And am forced to return empty-handed.
Pe. And the whole of Phoenicia and Egypt was erst
By a masterful Cuckoo commanded.
When his loud cuckoo-cry was resounding on high,
At once the Phoenicians would leap
All hands to the plain, rich-waving with grain,
Their wheat and their barley to reap.
Eu. So that’s why we cry to the circumcised “Hi!”
“Cuckoo! To the plain! Cuckoo!”
Pe. And whene’er in the cities of Hellas a chief
To honour and dignity grew,
Menelaus or King Agamemnon perchance,
Your rule was so firm and decided
That a bird on his sceptre would perch, to partake
Of the gifts for his Lordship provided.
Eu. Now of that I declare I was never aware;
And I oft have been filled with amaze,
When Priam so noble and stately appeared,
With a bird, in the tragedy-plays.
But the bird was no doubt for the gifts looking out,
To Lysicrates brought on the sly.

Pe. But the strongest and clearest of proofs is that Zeus
Who at present is Lord of the sky
Stands wearing, as Royalty’s emblem and badge,
An Eagle erect on his head,
Our Lady an owl, and Apollo forsooth,
As a lackey, a falcon instead.
Eu. By Demeter, ’tis true; that is just what they say,
But tell me the reason, I pray.
Pe. That the bird may be ready and able, whene’er
The sacrificed inwards we lay,
As custom demands, in the deity’s hands,
To seize before Zeus on the fare.
And none by the Gods, but all by the Birds,
Were accustomed aforetime to swear:
And Lampon will vow by the Goose even now,
Whenever he’s going to cheat you:
So holy and mighty they deemed you of old,
With so deep a respect did they treat you!
Now they treat you as knaves,
And as fools, and as slaves;
Yea they pelt you as though ye were mad.
No safety for you can the Temples ensure,
For the bird-catcher sets his nooses and nets,
And his traps, and his toils, and his bait, and his lure,
And his lime-covered rods in the shrine of the Gods!
Then he takes you, and sets you for sale in the lump;
And the customers, buying, come poking and prying
And twitching and trying,
To feel if your bodies are tender and plump.
And if they decide on your flesh to sup
They don’t just roast you and serve you up,
But over your bodies, as prone ye lie,
They grate their cheese and their silphium too,
And oil and vinegar add,
Then a gravy, luscious and rich, they brew,
And pour it in soft warm streams o’er you,
As though ye were carrion noisome and dry.
Ch. O man, ’tis indeed a most pitiful tale
Thou hast brought to our ears; and I can but bewail
Our fathers’ demerit,
Who, born such an Empire as this to inherit,
Have lost it, have lost it, for me!
But now thou art come, by good Fortune’s decree,
Our Saviour to be,
And under thy charge, whatsoever befall,
I will place my own self, and my nestlings, and all.
Now therefore do you tell us what we must do;
Since life is not worth our retaining,
Unless we be Lords of the world as before,
Our ancient dominion regaining.
Pe. Then first I propose that the Air ye enclose,
And the space ’twixt the Earth and the sky,
Encircling it all with a brick-built wall,
Like Babylon’s, solid and high;
And there you must place the abode of your race,
And make them one State, and one nation.
Eu. O Porphyrion! O Cebriones!
How stupendous the fortification!
Pe. When the wall is complete, send a messenger fleet,
The empire from Zeus to reclaim.
And if he deny, or be slow to comply,
Nor retreat in confusion and shame,
Proclaim ye against him a Holy War,
And announce that no longer below,
On their lawless amours through these regions of yours,
Will the Gods be permitted to go.
No more through the air (to their Alopes fair,
Their Alcmenas, their Semeles wending)
May they post in hot love, as of old, from above,
For if ever you catch them descending,
You will clap on their dissolute persons a seal,
Their evil designs to prevent!
And then let another ambassador-bird
To men with this message be sent,
That the Birds being Sovereigns, to them must be paid
All honour and worship divine,
And the Gods for the future to them be postponed.
Now therefore assort and combine
Each God with a bird, whichever will best
With his nature and attributes suit;
If to Queen Aphrodite a victim ye slay,
First sacrifice grain to the coot;
If a sheep to Poseidon ye slay, to the duck
Let wheat as a victim be brought;
And a big honey-cake for the cormorant make,
If ye offer to Heracles aught.
Bring a ram for King Zeus! But ye first must produce
For our Kinglet, the gold-crested wren,
A masculine midge, full formed and entire,
To be sacrificed duly by men.
Eu. I am tickled and pleased with the sacrificed midge.
Now thunder away, great *Zan*![^1]
Ch. But men, will they take us for Gods, and not daws,
Do ye really believe that they can—
If they see us on wings flying idly about?
Pe. Don’t say such ridiculous things!
Why, Hermes, and lots of the deities too,
Go flying about upon wings.
There is Victory, bold on her pinions of gold;
And then, by the Powers, there is Love;
And Iris, says *Homer*, shoots straight through the skies,
With the ease of a terrified dove.
Eu. And the thunderbolt flies upon wings, I surmise:
What if Zeus upon us let it fall?
Pe. But suppose that mankind, being stupid and blind,
Should account you as nothing at all,
And still in the Gods of Olympus believe—
Why then, like a cloud, shall a swarm
Of sparrows and rooks settle down on their stooks,
And devour all the seed in the farm.
Demeter may fill them with grain, if she will,
When hungry and pinched they entreat her.
Eu. O no, for by Zeus, she will make some excuse;
That is always the way with Demeter.
Pe. And truly the ravens shall pluck out the eyes
Of the oxen that work in the plough,
Of the flocks and the herds, as a proof that the Birds
Are the Masters and Potentates now.
Apollo the leech, if his aid they beseech,
May cure them; but then they must pay!
Eu. Nay but hold, nay but hold, nor begin till I’ve sold
My two little oxen I pray.
Pe. But when once to esteem you as God, and as Life,
And as Cronos and Earth they’ve begun,
And as noble Poseidon, what joys shall be theirs!
Ch. Will you kindly inform me of one?
Pe. The delicate tendrils and bloom of the vine
No more shall the locusts molest,
One gallant brigade of the kestrels and owls
Shall rid them at once of the pest.
No more shall the mite and the gall-making blight
The fruit of the fig-tree devour;
Of thrushes one troop on their armies shall swoop,
And clear them all off in an hour.
Ch. But how shall we furnish the people with wealth?
It is wealth that they mostly desire.
Pe. Choice blessings and rare ye shall give them whene’er
They come to your shrine to inquire.
To the seer ye shall tell when ’tis lucky and well
For a merchant to sail o’er the seas,
So that never a skipper again shall be lost.
Ch. What, “never”? Explain if you please.
Pe. Are they seeking to know when a voyage to go?
The Birds shall give answers to guide them.
“Now stick to the land, there’s a tempest at hand!
Now sail!” and good luck shall betide them.
Eu. A galley for me; I am off to the sea!
No longer with you will I stay.
Pe. The treasures of silver long since in the earth
By their forefathers hidden away
To men ye shall show, for the secret ye know.
How often a man will declare,
“There is no one who knows where my treasures repose,
If it be not a bird of the air.”
Eu. My galley may go; I will buy me a hoe,
And dig for the crock and the casket.
Ch. But Health, I opine, is a blessing divine;
Can we give it to men if they ask it?
Pe. If they’ve plenty of wealth, they’ll have plenty of health;
Ye may rest quite assured that they will.
Did you ever hear tell of a man that was well,
When faring remarkably ill?
Ch. Long life ’tis Olympus alone can bestow;
So can men live as long as before?
Must they die in their youth?
Pe. Die? No! why in truth
Their lives by three hundred or more
New years ye will lengthen.
Ch. Why, whence will they come?
Pe. From your own inexhaustible store.
What! dost thou not know that the noisy-tongued crow
Lives five generations of men?
Eu. O fie! it is plain they are fitter to reign
Than the Gods; let us have them again.
Pe. Ay fitter by far!
No need for their sakes to erect and adorn
Great temples of marble with portals of gold.
Enough for the birds on the brake and the thorn
And the evergreen oak their receptions to hold.
Or if any are noble, and courtly, and fine,
The tree of the olive will serve for their shrine.
No need, when a blessing we seek, to repair
To Delphi or Ammon, and sacrifice there;
We will under an olive or arbutus stand
With a present of barley and wheat,
And piously lifting our heart and our hand
The birds for a boon we’ll entreat,
And the boon shall be ours, and our suit we shall gain
At the cost of a few little handfuls of grain.
Ch. I thought thee at first of my foemen the worst;
And lo, I have found thee the wisest
And best of my friends, and our nation intends
To do whatsoe’er thou advisest.
A spirit so lofty and rare
Thy words have within me excited,
That I lift up my soul, and I swear
That if Thou wilt with Me be united
In bonds that are holy and true
And honest and just and sincere,
If our hearts are attuned to one song,
We will march on the Gods without fear;
The sceptre—my sceptre, my due—
They shall not be handling it long!
So all that by muscle and strength can be done,
We Birds will assuredly do;
But whatever by prudence and skill must be won,
We leave altogether to you.
Ho. Aye and, by Zeus, the time is over now
For drowsy nods and Nicias-hesitations.
We must be up and doing! And do you,
Or e’er we start, visit this nest of mine,
My bits of things, my little sticks and straws;
And tell me what your names are.
Pe. That’s soon done.
My name is Peisthetaerus.
Ho. And your friend’s?
Pe. Euelpides of Crio.
Ho. Well, ye are both
Heartily welcome.
Pe. Thank you.
Ho. Come ye in.
Pe. Aye, come we in; you, please, precede us.
Ho. Come.
Pe. But—dear! what was it? step you back a moment.
O yes—but tell us, how can he and I
Consort with you, we wingless and you winged?
Ho. Why, very well.
Pe. Nay, but in *Aesop’s* fables
There’s something, mind you, told about the fox
How ill it fared, consorting with an eagle.
Ho. O never fear; for there’s a little root
Which when ye have eaten, ye will both be winged.
Pe. That being so, we’ll enter. Xanthias there,
And Manodorus, bring along the traps.
Ch. O stay, and O stay!
Ho. Why what ails you today?
Ch. Take the gentlemen in, and regale them, we say
But O for the nightingale peerless in song,
Who chants in the choir of the Muses her lay;
Our sweetest and best, fetch her out of the nest,
And leave her awhile with the Chorus to play.
Pe. O do, by Zeus, grant them this one request;
Fetch out the little warbler from the reeds.
Eu. Yes, fetch her out by all the Gods, that so
We too may gaze upon the nightingale.
Ho. Well, if you wish it, so we’ll have it. Procne,
Come hither, dear, and let the strangers see you.

*Enter Procne, with nightingale’s head and wings, otherwise clad as a girl, in a rich costume.*

Pe. Zeus, what a darling lovely little bird!
How fair, and tender!
Eu. O the little love,
Wouldn’t I like to be her mate this instant!
Pe. And O the gold she is wearing, like a girl.
Eu. Upon my word, I’ve half a mind to kiss her!
Pe. Kiss her, you fool! Her beak’s a pair of spits.
Eu. But I would treat her like an egg, and strip
The eggshell from her poll, and kiss her so.
Ho. Come, go we in.
Pe. Lead on, and luck go with us.

*Exeunt Hoopoe, Euelpides, and Peisthetaerus.*

## Chorus

O darling! O tawny-throat!
Love, whom I love the best,
Dearer than all the rest,
Playmate and partner in
All my soft lays,
Thou art come! Thou art come!
Thou hast dawned on my gaze,
I have heard thy sweet note,
Nightingale! Nightingale!
Thou from thy flute softly-sounding canst bring
Music to suit with our songs of the Spring:
Begin then I pray
Our own anapaestic address to essay.
Ye men who are dimly existing below,
Who perish and fade as the leaf,
Pale, woebegone, shadowlike, spiritless folk,
Life feeble and wingless and brief,
Frail castings in clay, who are gone in a day,
Like a dream full of sorrow and sighing,
Come listen with care to the Birds of the air,
The ageless, the deathless, who flying
In the joy and the freshness of Ether, are wont
To muse upon wisdom undying.
We will tell you of things transcendental; of Springs
And of Rivers the mighty upheaval;
The nature of Birds; and the birth of the Gods:
And of Chaos and Darkness primeval.
When this ye shall know, let old Prodicus go,
And be hanged without hope of reprieval.
There was Chaos at first, and Darkness, and Night,
And Tartarus vasty and dismal;
But the Earth was not there, nor the Sky, nor the Air,
Till at length in the bosom abysmal
Of Darkness an egg, from the whirlwind conceived,
Was laid by the sable-plumed Night.
And out of that egg, as the Seasons revolved,
Sprang Love, the entrancing, the bright,
Love brilliant and bold with his pinions of gold,
Like a whirlwind, refulgent and sparkling!
Love hatched us, commingling in Tartarus wide,
With Chaos, the murky, the darkling.
And brought us above, as the firstlings of love,
And first to the light we ascended.
There was never a race of Immortals at all
Till Love had the universe blended;
Then all things commingling together in love,
There arose the fair Earth, and the Sky,
And the limitless Sea; and the race of the Gods,
The Blessed, who never shall die.
So we than the Blessed are older by far;
And abundance of proof is existing
That we are the children of Love, for we fly,
Unfortunate lovers assisting.
And many a man who has found, to his cost,
That his powers of persuasion have failed,
And his loves have abjured him forever, again
By the power of the Birds has prevailed;
For the gift of a quail, or a porphyry rail,
Or a Persian, or goose, will regain them.
And the chiefest of blessings ye mortals enjoy,
By the help of the Birds ye obtain them.
’Tis from us that the signs of the Seasons in turn,
Spring, Winter, and Autumn are known.
When to Libya the crane flies clanging again,
It is time for the seed to be sown,
And the skipper may hang up his rudder awhile,
And sleep after all his exertions,
And Orestes may weave him a wrap to be warm
When he’s out on his thievish excursions.
Then cometh the kite, with its hovering flight,
Of the advent of Spring to tell,
And the spring sheep-shearing begins; and next,
Your woollen attire you sell,
And buy you a lighter and daintier garb,
When you note the return of the swallow.
Thus your Ammon, Dodona, and Delphi are we;
We are also your Phoebus Apollo.
For whatever you do, if a trade you pursue,
Or goods in the market are buying,
Or the wedding attend of a neighbour and friend,
First you look to the Birds and their flying.
And whene’er you of omen or augury speak,
’Tis a bird you are always repeating;
A Rumour’s a bird, and a sneeze is a bird,
And so is a word or a meeting,
A servant’s a bird, and an ass is a bird.
It must therefore assuredly follow
That the Birds are to you (I protest it is true)
Your prophetic divining Apollo.

Then take us for Gods, as is proper and fit,
And Muses Prophetic ye’ll have at your call
Spring, winter, and summer, and autumn and all.
And we won’t run away from your worship, and sit
Up above in the clouds, very stately and grand,
Like Zeus in his tempers: but always at hand
Health and wealth we’ll bestow, as the formula runs,
“On yourselves, and your sons, and the sons of your sons”;
And happiness, plenty, and peace shall belong
To you all; and the revel, the dance, and the song,
And laughter, and youth, and the milk of the birds
We’ll supply, and we’ll never forsake you.
Ye’ll be quite overburdened with pleasures and joys,
So happy and blest we will make you.

O woodland Muse.
“Do, tio, do, tiotinx,”
Of varied plume, with whose dear aid
On the mountain top, and the sylvan glade,
“Do, tio, do, tiotinx,”
I, sitting up aloft on a leafy ash, full oft,
“Do, tio, do, tiotinx,”
Pour forth a warbling note from my little tawny throat,
Pour festive choral dances to the mountain mother’s praise,
And to Pan the holy music of his own immortal lays:
“Tototototototototinx,”
Whence Phrynichus of old,
Sipping the fruit of our ambrosial lay,
Bore, like a bee, the honied store away,
His own sweet songs to mould,
“Tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx.”

Is there any one amongst you,
O spectators, who would lead
With the birds a life of pleasure,
Let him come to us with speed
All that here is reckoned shameful,
All that here the laws condemn,
With the birds is right and proper,
You may do it all with them.
Is it here by law forbidden
For a son to beat his sire?
That a chick should strike his father,
Strutting up with youthful ire,
Crowing, “Raise your spur and fight me,”
That is what the birds admire.
Come you runaway deserter,
Spotted o’er with marks of shame,
Spotted Francolin we’ll call you,
That, with us, shall be your name.
You who style yourself a tribesman,
Phrygian pure as Spintharus,
Come and be a Phrygian linnet,
Of Philemon’s breed, with us.
Come along, you slave and Carian,
Execestides to wit,
Breed with us your Cuckoo-rearers,
They’ll be guildsmen apt and fit.
Son of Peisias, who to outlaws
Would the city gates betray,
Come to us, and be a partridge
(Cockerel life the cock they say),
We esteem it no dishonour
Knavish partridge-tricks to play.

Even thus the Swans,
“Tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,”
Their clamorous cry were erst up-raising,
With clatter of wings Apollo praising,
“Tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,”
As they sat in serried ranks on the river Hebrus’ banks.
“Tio, tio, tio, tiotinx,”
Right upward went the cry
Through the cloud and through the sky.
Quailed the wild-beast in his covert,
And the bird within her nest,
And the still and windless Ether
Lulled the ocean-waves to rest.
“Tototototototototinx.”
Loudly Olympus rang!
Amazement seized the kings; and every Grace
And every Muse within that heavenly place
Took up the strain, and sang.
“Tio, tio, tio, tio, tiotinx.”

Truly to be clad in feather
Is the very best of things.
Only fancy, dear spectators,
Had you each a brace of wings,
Never need you, tired and hungry,
At a tragic chorus stay,
You would lightly, when it bored you,
Spread your wings and fly away,
Back returning, after luncheon,
To enjoy our comic play.
Never need a Patrocleides,
Sitting here, his garment stain;
When the dire occasion seized him,
He would off with might and main
Flying home, then flying hither,
Lightened and relieved, again.
If a gallant should the husband
On the Council-bench behold
Of a gay and charming lady,
One whom he had loved of old,
Off at once he’d fly to greet her,
Have a little converse sweet,
Then be back, or e’er ye missed him,
Calm and smiling in his seat.
Is not then a suit of feathers
Quite the very best of things?
Why, Diitrephes was chosen,
Though he had but wicker wings,
First a Captain, then a Colonel,
Till from nothing he of late
Has become a tawny cock-horse,
Yea a pillar of the State!

*Enter Peisthetaerus and Euelpides, equipped with wings.*

Pe. Well, here we are. By Zeus, I never saw
In all my life a sight more laughable.
Eu. What are you laughing at?
Pe. At your flight-feathers.
I’ll tell you what you’re like, your wings and you,
Just like a gander, sketched by some cheap-jack.
Eu. And you, a blackbird, with a bowl-cropped noddle.
Pe. These shafts of ridicule are winged by nought
But our own plumes, as *Aeschylus* would say.
Ch. What’s the next step?
Pe. First we must give the city
Some grand big name: and then we’ll sacrifice
To the high Gods.
Eu. That’s my opinion also.
Ch. Then let’s consider what the name shall be.
Pe. What think you of that grand Laconian name,
Sparta?
Eu. What! Sparta for my city? No.
I wouldn’t use esparto for my pallet,
Not if I’d cords; by Heracles, not I.
Pe. How shall we name it then?
Ch. Invent some fine
Magniloquent name, drawn from these upper spaces
And clouds.
Pe. What think you of Cloudcuckoobury?
Ch. Good! Good!
You have found a good big name, and no mistake.
Eu. Is this the great Cloudcuckoobury town
Where all the wealth of Aeschines lies hid,
And all Theagenes’s?
Pe. Best of all,
This is the plain of Phlegra, where the Gods
Outshot the giants at the game of Brag.
Eu. A glistering sort of a city! Who shall be
Its guardian God? For whom shall we weave the *Peplus*?
Pe. Why not retain Athene, City-Keeper?
Eu. And how can that be a well-ordered State,
Where she, a woman born, a Goddess, stands
Full-armed, and Cleisthenes assumes a spindle?
Pe. And who shall hold the citadel’s Storkade?
Ch. A bird of ours, one of the Persian breed,
Everywhere noted as the War-god’s own
Armipotent cockerel.
Eu. O, Prince Cockerel? Yes,
He’s just the God to perch upon the rocks.
Pe. Now, comrade, get you up into the air,
And lend a hand to those that build the wall.
Bring up the rubble; strip, and mix the mortar;
Run up the ladder with the hod; fall off;
Station the sentinels; conceal the fire;
Round with the alarum bell; go fast asleep;
And send two heralds, one to heaven above,
And one to earth below; and let them come
From thence, for me.
Eu. And you, remaining here,
Be hanged—for me!
Pe. Go where I send you, comrade,

*Exit Euelpides, who does not appear again.*

Without your help there, nothing will be done.
But I, to sacrifice to these new Gods,
Must call the priest to regulate the show.
Boy! Boy! take up the basket and the laver.
Ch. I’m with you, you’ll find me quite willing:
I highly approve of your killing
A lambkin, to win us the favour divine,
Mid holy processionals, stately and fine,
Up high, up high, let the Pythian cry,
The Pythian cry to the God be sent;
Let Chaeris play the accompaniment.
Pe. O stop that puffing! Heracles, what’s this?
Faith, I’ve seen many a sight, but never yet
A mouth-band-wearing raven! Now then, priest,
To the new Gods commence the sacrifice.

*Enter Priest.*

Priest. I’ll do your bidding. Where’s the basket-bearer?

[^1]: Doric for Zeus.

Let us pray
To the *Hestia*-bird of the household shrine,
And the Kite that watches her feasts divine,
And to all the *Olympian* birds and birdesses,

**Peisthetaerus:** O Sunium-hawking, King of the Sea-mew, hail!

**Priest:** And to the holy Swan, the *Pythian* and *Delian* one,
And to thee too, Quail-guide *Leto*,
And to *Artemis* the Thistle-finch,

**Peisthetaerus:** Aye, Thistle-finch; no more *Colaenis* now!

**Priest:** And to *Sabazius* the Phrygian linnet; and then
To *Rhea* the Great Mother of Gods and men;

**Peisthetaerus:** Aye, Ostrich-queen, *Cleocritus's* Mother!

**Priest:** That they may grant health and salvation
To the whole Cloudcuckooburian nation,
For themselves and the Chians.

**Peisthetaerus:** I like the Chians everywhere tacked on.

**Priest:** And to the hero-birds and sons of heroes,
And to the *Porphyrion* rail;
And to the pelican white, and pelican grey;
And to the eagle, and to the capercaillie;
And to the peacock, and to the sedgewarbler;
And to the teal, and to the skua;
And to the heron, and to the gannet;
And to the blackcap, and to the titmouse—

**Peisthetaerus:** Stop, stop your calling, hang you. O, look here.
To what a victim, idiot, are you calling
Ospreys and vultures? Don't you see that one
One single kite could carry off the whole?
Get away hence, you and your garlands too!
Myself alone will sacrifice this victim.

*Exit Priest.*

**Chorus:**
Once more as the laver they're bringing,
Once more I my hymns must be singing,
Hymns holy and pious, the Gods to invite—
One alone, only one,—to our festival rite.
Your feast for two, I am sure won't do.
For what you are going to offer there,
Is nothing at all but horns and hair.

**Peisthetaerus:** Let us pray,
Offering our victim to the feathery gods.

*Enter a poet, to celebrate the founding of the new colony.*

**Poet** (singing):
Cloudcuckoobury
With praise and glory crown,
Singing, O Muse,
Of the new and happy town!

**Peisthetaerus:** Whatever's this? Why, who in the world are you?

**Poet:** O I'm a warbler, carolling sweet lays,
An eager meagre servant of the Muses,
As *Homer* says.

**Peisthetaerus:** What! you a slave and wear your hair so long?

**Poet:** No, but all we who teach sweet choral lays
Are eager meagre servants of the Muses,
As *Homer* says.

**Peisthetaerus:** That's why your cloak so meagre seems, no doubt.
But, poet, what ill wind has blown you hither?

**Poet:** Oh I've been making, making lovely songs,
*Simonidean*, virgin songs, and sweet
Dithyrambic songs, on your Cloudcuckooburies.

**Peisthetaerus:** When did you first begin these lovely songs?

**Poet:** Long, long ago, O yes! Long, long ago!

**Peisthetaerus:** Why, is not this the City's Tenth-day feast?
I've just this instant given the child its name.

**Poet:**
But fleet, as the merry many-twinkling horses' feet,
The airy fairy Rumour of the Muses.
*Aetna's* Founder, father mine,
Whose name is the same as the holy altar flame,
Give to me what thy bounty chooses
To give me willingly of thine.

**Peisthetaerus:** He'll cause us trouble now, unless we give him
Something, and so get off. Hallo, you priest,
Why, you've a jerkin and a tunic too;
Strip, give the jerkin to this clever poet.
Take it; upon my word you do seem cold.

**Poet:**
This little kindly gift the Muse
Accepts with willing condescension;
But let me to an apt remark
Of *Pindar* call my lord's attention.

**Peisthetaerus:** The fellow does not seem inclined to leave us.

**Poet:**
Out among the *Scythians* yonder
See poor *Straton* wander, wander,
Poor poor *Straton*, not possessed
Of a whirly-woven vest.
All inglorious comes, I trow, leather jerkin, if below
No soft tunic it can show.
Conceive my drift, I pray.

**Peisthetaerus:** Aye, I conceive you want the tunic too.
Off with it, you. Needs must assist a Poet.
There, take it, and depart.

**Poet:**
Yes, I'll depart,
And make to the city pretty songs like this;
O Thou of the golden throne,
Sing Her, the quivering, shivering;
I came to the plains many-sown,
I came to the snowy, the blowy.
*Alalae!*

*Exit poet.*

**Peisthetaerus:** Well, well, but now you surely have escaped
From all those shiverings, with that nice warm vest.
This is, by *Zeus*, a plague I never dreamed of
That he should find our city out so soon.
Boy, take the laver and walk round once more.
Now hush!

*Enter oracle-monger.*

**Oracle-Monger:** Forbear! touch not the goat awhile.

**Peisthetaerus:** Eh? Who are you?

**Oracle-Monger:** A soothsayer.

**Peisthetaerus:** You be hanged!

**Oracle-Monger:** O think not lightly, friend, of things divine;
Know I've an oracle of *Bakis*, bearing
On your Cloudcuckooburies.

**Peisthetaerus:** Eh? then why
Did you not soothsay that before I founded
My city here?

**Oracle-Monger:** The Power within forbade me.

**Peisthetaerus:** Well, well, there's nought like hearing what it says.

**Oracle-Monger:**
> “Nay but if once grey crows
> and wolves shall be banding together.
> Out in the midway space,
> 'twixt *Corinth* and *Sicyon*, dwelling—”

**Peisthetaerus:** But what in the world have I to do with *Corinth*?

**Oracle-Monger:** *Bakis* is riddling: *Bakis* means the Air.
> “First to *Pandora* offer
> a white-fleeced ram for a victim.
> Next, who first shall arrive
> my verses prophetic expounding,
> Give him a brand-new cloak
> and a pair of excellent sandals.”

**Peisthetaerus:** Are sandals in it?

**Oracle-Monger:** Take the book and see.
> “Give him moreover a cup,
> and fill his hands with the inwards.”

**Peisthetaerus:** Are inwards in it?

**Oracle-Monger:** Take the book and see.
> “Youth, divinely inspired,
> if thou dost as I bid, thou shalt surely
> Soar in the clouds as an Eagle;
> refuse, and thou ne'er shalt become an
> Eagle, or even a dove,
> or a woodpecker tapping the oak-tree.”

**Peisthetaerus:** Is all that in it?

**Oracle-Monger:** Take the book and see.

**Peisthetaerus:** O how unlike your oracle to mine,
Which from *Apollo's* words I copied out;
> “But if a cheat, an impostor,
> presume to appear uninvited,
> Troubling the sacred rites,
> and lusting to taste of the inwards,
> Hit him betwixt the ribs
> with all your force and your fury.”

**Oracle-Monger:** You're jesting surely.

**Peisthetaerus:** Take the book and see.
> “See that ye spare not the rogue,
> though he soar in the clouds as an Eagle,
> Yea, be he *Lampon* himself
> or even the great *Diopeithes*.”

**Oracle-Monger:** Is all that in it?

**Peisthetaerus:** Take the book and see.
Get out! be off, confound you! (striking him)

**Oracle-Monger:** O! O! O!

**Peisthetaerus:** There, run away and soothsay somewhere else.

*Exit oracle-monger; enter Meton, with the instruments of a land-surveyor.*

**Meton:** I come amongst you—

**Peisthetaerus:** Some new misery this!
Come to do what? What's your scheme's form and outline?
What's your design? What buskin's on your foot?

**Meton:** I come to land-survey this Air of yours,
And mete it out by acres.

**Peisthetaerus:** Heaven and Earth!
Whoever are you?

**Meton** (*scandalized*): Whoever am I! I'm *Meton*!
Known throughout *Hellas* and *Colonus*.

**Peisthetaerus:** Aye,
And what are these?

**Meton:** They're rods for Air-surveying.
I'll just explain. The Air's, in outline, like
One vast extinguisher; so then, observe,
Applying here my flexible rod, and fixing
My compass there—you understand?

**Peisthetaerus:** I don't.

**Meton:** With the straight rod I measure out, that so
The circle may be squared; and in the centre
A market-place; and streets be leading to it
Straight to the very centre; just as from
A star, though circular, straight rays flash out
In all directions.

**Peisthetaerus:** Why, the man's a *Thales*! *Meton*!

**Meton:** Yes, what?

**Peisthetaerus:** You know I love you, *Meton*,
Take my advice, and slip away unnoticed.

**Meton:** Why, what's the matter?

**Peisthetaerus:** As in *Lacedaemon*
There's stranger-hunting; and a great disturbance;
And blows in plenty.

**Meton:** What, a Revolution?

**Peisthetaerus:** No, no, not that.

**Meton:** What then?

**Peisthetaerus:** They've all resolved
With one consent to wallop every quack.

**Meton:** I'd best be going.

**Peisthetaerus:** Faith, I'm not quite certain
If you're in time; see, see the blows are coming!
(striking him)

**Meton:** O, murder! help!

**Peisthetaerus:** I told you how 'twould be.
Come, measure off your steps some other way.

*Exit Meton. Enter a commissioner, to inspect the new colony.*

**Commissioner:** Ho! consuls, ho!

**Peisthetaerus:** *Sardanapalus*, surely!

**Commissioner:** Lo, I to your Cloudcuckooburies come,
By lot Commissioner.

**Peisthetaerus:** Commissioner?
Who sent you hither?

**Commissioner:** Lo, a paltry scroll
Of *Teleas*.

**Peisthetaerus:** Come now, will you take your pay
And get you gone in peace?

**Commissioner:** By Heaven I will.
I ought to be at home on public business,
Some little jobs I've had with *Pharnaces*.

**Peisthetaerus:** Then take your pay, and go: your pay's just
—this. (Striking him.)

**Commissioner:** What's that?

**Peisthetaerus:** A motion about *Pharnaces*.

**Commissioner:** Witness! he's striking a Commissioner.

**Peisthetaerus:** Shoo! Shoo! begone; you and your verdict-urns.

*Enter statute-seller.*

The shame it is! They send Commissioners
Before we've finished our inaugural rites.

**Statute-Seller** (reading):
> “But if the Cloudcuckooburian wrong the *Athenian*—”

**Peisthetaerus:** Here's some more writing. What new misery's this?

**Statute-Seller:** I am a Statute-seller, and I'm come
Bringing new laws to sell you.

**Peisthetaerus:** Such as what?

**Statute-Seller:**
> “Item, the Cloudcuckooburians are to use
> the selfsame weights and measures, and the
> selfsame coinage as the *Olophyxians*.”

**Peisthetaerus:** And you the selfsame as the Oh! Oh!-tyxians.
(striking him)

**Statute-Seller:** Hi! what are you at?

**Peisthetaerus:** Take off those laws, you rascal.
Laws you won't like I'll give you in a minute.

*Exit statute-seller; but he and the commissioner each make two brief reappearances, and vanish.*

**Commissioner** (*reappearing*): I summon Peisthetaerus for
next *Munychion* on a charge of outrage.

**Peisthetaerus:** O that's it, is it? What, are you there still?

**Statute-Seller** (*reappearing*):
> “Item, if any man drive away the
> magistrates, and do not receive them according
> to the pillar—”

**Peisthetaerus:** O mercy upon us, and art you there still?

**Commissioner** (*reappearing*): I'll ruin you! I claim ten thousand drachmas!

**Peisthetaerus:** I'll overturn your verdict-urn, I will.

**Statute-Seller** (*reappearing*): Think of that evening when
you fouled the pillar.

**Peisthetaerus:** Ugh! seize him, somebody! Ha, you're off
there, are you?
Let's get away from this, and go within,
And there we'll sacrifice the goat in peace.

*Exeunt omnes, and the goat is supposed to be sacrificed within.*

**Chorus:**
Unto me, the All-controlling,
All-surveying,
Now will men, at every altar,
Prayers be praying;
Me who watch the land, protecting
Fruit and flower,
Slay the myriad-swarming insects
Who the tender buds devour
In the earth and on the branches
With a never-satiate malice,
Nipping off the blossom as it widens from the chalice.
And I slay the noisome creatures
Which consume
And pollute the garden's freshly scented bloom;
And every little biter, and every creeping thing
Perish in destruction at the onset of my wing.

Listen to the City's notice,
Specially proclaimed today:
> “Sirs, *Diagoras*¹ the *Melian*
> whosoever of you slay,
> Shall receive, reward, one talent;
> and another we'll bestow
> If you slay some ancient tyrant,
> dead and buried long ago.”

We, the Birds, will give a notice,
We proclaim with right good will,
> “Sirs, *Philocrates*, *Sparrovian*,
> whosoever of you kill,
> Shall receive, reward, one talent,
> if alive you bring him, four;
> Him who strings and sells the finches,
> seven an *obol*, at his store,
> Blows the thrushes out and, rudely,
> to the public gaze exposes,
> Shamefully entreats the blackbirds,
> thrusting feathers up their noses.
> Pigeons too the rascal catches,
> keeps and mews them up with care,
> Makes them labour as decoy-birds,
> tethered underneath a snare.”

Such the notice we would give you.
And we wish you all to know,
Who are keeping birds in cages,
You had better let them go.
Else the Birds will surely catch you,
And yourselves in turn employ,
Tied and tethered up securely,
Other rascals to decoy.

O the happy clan of birds
Clad in feather;
Needing not a woollen vest in
Wintry weather;
Heeding not the warm far-flashing
Summer ray,
For within the leafy bosoms
Of the flowery meads I stay,
When the Chirruper in ecstasy
Is shrilling forth his tune,
Maddened with the sunshine,
And the rapture of the noon.
And I winter in the caverns'
Hollow spaces,
With the happy *Oreads* playing; and in Spring
I crop the virgin flowers of the myrtles white and tender,
Dainties that are fashioned in the gardens of the *Graces*.

---
¹ *Diagoras*, an atheist, had divulged and reviled the Mysteries.
---

*Enter Peisthetaerus.*

**Peisthetaerus:** Dear Birds, our sacrifice is most auspicious.
But strange it is, no messenger has come
From the great wall we are building, with the news.
Hah! here runs one with true *Alpheian* pantings.

*Enter messenger, panting like an Olympian runner.*

**Messenger:** Where, where,—O where, where, where—
O where, where, where,
Where, where's our leader Peisthetaerus?

**Peisthetaerus:** Here.

**Messenger:** Your building's built! The wall's complete!

**Peisthetaerus:** Well done.

**Messenger:** And a most grand, magnificent work it is.
So broad, that on its top the Braggadocian
*Proxenides* could pass *Theagenes*
Each driving in his chariot, drawn by horses
As bulky as the Trojan.

**Peisthetaerus:** *Heracles*!

**Messenger:** And then its height, I measured that, is just
Six hundred feet.

**Peisthetaerus:** *Poseidon*, what a height!
Who built it up to that enormous size?

**Messenger:** The birds, none other; no Egyptian, bearing
The bricks, no mason, carpenter was there;
Their own hands wrought it, marvellous to see.
From *Libya* came some thirty thousand cranes
With great foundation-stones they had swallowed down;
And these the corn-crakes fashioned with their beaks.
Ten thousand storks were carrying up the bricks;
And lapwings helped, and the other water-birds,
To bring the water up into the air.

**Peisthetaerus:** Who bare aloft the mortar for them?

**Messenger:** Herons
In hods.

**Peisthetaerus:** But how did they get the mortar in?

**Messenger:** O that was most ingeniously contrived.
The geese struck down their feet, and slid them under,
Like shovels, and so heaved it on the hods.

**Peisthetaerus:** Then is there anything that feet can't do?

**Messenger:** And then the ducks, with girdles round their waists,
Carried the bricks: and up the swallows flew,
Like serving-lads, carrying behind them each
His trowel, and the mortar in their mouths.

**Peisthetaerus:** Then why should men hire hirelings any more!
Well, well, go on; who was it finished off
The great wall's woodwork?

**Messenger:** Canny Pelicans,
Excellent workmen, hewing with huge beaks
Gate-timber; and the uproar as they hewed
Was like an arsenal when ships are building.
Now every gateway has its gate, fast-barred,
And watched the whole way round; and birds are pacing
Their beats, and carrying bells, and everywhere
The guards are stationed, and the beacons blaze
On every tower. But I must hurry off
And wash myself. You, manage what remains.

*Exit.*

**Chorus:** O man, what ails you? Do you feel surprised
To hear the building has been built so soon?

**Peisthetaerus:** By all the Gods I do; and well I may.
In very truth it seems to me like—lies.
But see! a guard, a messenger from thence
Is running towards us with a war-dance look!

*Enter a guard.*

**Guard:** Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Hallo!

**Peisthetaerus:** Why, what's up now?

**Guard:** A terrible thing has happened.
One of the Gods, of *Zeus's* Gods, has just,
Giving our jackdaw sentinels the slip,
Shot through the gates and flown into the air.

**Peisthetaerus:** A dreadful deed! A wicked scandalous deed!
Which of the Gods?

**Guard:** We know not. Wings he had,
So much we know.

**Peisthetaerus:** Ye should have sent at once
The civic guard in hot pursuit.

**Guard:** We sent
The mounted archers, thirty thousand falcons,
All with their talons curved, in fighting trim,
Hawk, buzzard, vulture, eagle, eagle-owl.
Yea, Ether vibrates with the whizz and whirr
Of beating pinions, as they seek the God.
Ay, and he's near methinks; he's very near;
He's somewhere here.

**Peisthetaerus:** A sling, a sling, I say!
Arrows and bows! Fall in, my merrymen all!
Shoot, smite, be resolute. A sling! a sling!

**Chorus:**
War is begun, inexpressive war,
War is begun 'twixt the Gods and me!
Look out, look out, through the cloud-wrapt air
Which erst the Darkness of *Erebus* bare,
Lest a God slip by, and we fail to see.
Glance eager-eyed on every side,
For close at hand the winged sound I hear
Of some Immortal hurtling through the Sky.

*Enter Iris.*

**Peisthetaerus:** Hoi! whither away there? whither away?
Stop! stop!
Stop where you are! keep quiet! stay! remain!
Who, what, whence are you? where do you come from? Quick!

**Iris:** Whence do I come? From the *Olympian* Gods.

**Peisthetaerus:** Your name! What is it? Sloop or Head-dress?

**Iris:** *Iris*
The fleet.

**Peisthetaerus:** The *Paralus*, or the *Salaminian*?

**Iris:** Why, what's all this?

**Peisthetaerus:** Fly up, some buzzard there,
Fly up, and seize her.

**Iris:** Me! Seize me, do you say?
What the plague's this?

**Peisthetaerus:** You'll find to your cost, directly—

**Iris:** Well now, this passes!

**Peisthetaerus:** Answer! By what gates
Got you within the city wall, Miss Minx?

**Iris:** I'faith, I know not, fellow, by what gates.

**Peisthetaerus:** You hear the jade, how she prevaricates!
Saw you the daw-commanders? What, no answer?
Where's your stork-pass?

**Iris:** My patience, what do you mean?

**Peisthetaerus:** You never got one?

**Iris:** Have you lost your wits?

**Peisthetaerus:** Did no bird-captain stick a label on you?

**Iris:** On me? None stuck a label, wretch, on me.

**Peisthetaerus:** So then you thought in this sly stealthy way
To fly through Chaos and a realm not yours?

**Iris:** And by what route, then, ought the Gods to fly?

**Peisthetaerus:** I'faith, I know not. Only not by this.
This is a trespass! If you got your rights,
Of all the *Irises* that ever were
You'd be most justly seized and put to death.

**Iris:** But I am deathless.

**Peisthetaerus:** All the same for that
You should have died. A pretty thing, forsooth,
If, whilst all else obey us, you the Gods
Run riot, and forget that you in turn
Must learn to yield obedience to your betters.
But tell me, where do you navigate your wings?

**Iris:** I? From the Father to mankind I'm flying,
To bid them on their bullock-slaughtering hearths
Slay sheep to the *Olympian* Gods, and steam
The streets with savour.

**Peisthetaerus:** What do you say? What Gods?

**Iris:** What Gods? To us, the Gods in Heaven, of course.

**Peisthetaerus** (*with supreme contempt*): What, art you Gods?

**Iris:** What other Gods exist?

**Peisthetaerus:** Birds are now Gods to men; and men must slay
Victims to them; and not, by *Zeus*, to *Zeus*.

**Iris:** O fool, fool, fool! Stir not the mighty wrath
Of angry Gods, lest Justice, with the spade
Of vengeful *Zeus*, demolish all thy race,
And fiery vapour, with *Licymnian* strokes,
Incinerate thy palace and thyself!

**Peisthetaerus:** Now listen, girl; have done with that bombast.
(Don't move.) A *Lydian* or a *Phrygian* is it,
You think to terrify with words like those?
Look here. If *Zeus* keep troubling me, I'll soon
Incinerate his great *Amphion's* domes
And halls of state with eagles carrying fire.
And up against him, to high heaven, I'll send
More than six hundred stout *Porphyrion* rails
All clad in leopard-skins. Yet I remember
When one *Porphyrion* gave him toil enough.
And as for you, his waiting-maid, if you
Keep troubling me with your outrageous ways,
I'll outrage you, and you'll be quite surprised
To find the strength of an old man like me.

**Iris:** O shame upon you, wretch, your words and you.

**Peisthetaerus:** Now then begone; shoo, shoo! *Eurax pa tax*!

**Iris:** My father won't stand this; I vow he won't.

**Peisthetaerus:** Now *Zeus*-a-mercy, maiden; fly you off.
Incinerate some younger man than I.

*Exit Iris.*

**Chorus:**
Never again shall the *Zeus*-born Gods,
Never again shall they pass this way!
Never again through this realm of ours
Shall men send up to the heavenly Powers
The savour of beasts which on earth they slay!

**Peisthetaerus:** Well but that herald whom we sent to men,
'Tis strange if he should nevermore return.

*Enter herald.*

**Herald:** O Peisthetaerus, O thou wisest, best,
Thou wisest, deepest, happiest of mankind,
Most glorious, most—O give the word!

**Peisthetaerus:** What news?

**Herald:** Accept this golden crown, wherewith all peoples
Crown and revere thee for thy wisdom's sake!

**Peisthetaerus:** I do. What makes them all revere me so?

**Herald:** O thou who hast built the ethereal glorious city,
Dost thou not know how men revere thy name,
And burn with ardour for this realm of thine?
Why, till ye built this city in the air,
All men had gone *Laconian*-mad; they went
Long-haired, half-starved, unwashed, *Socratified*,
With *scytales* in their hands; but O the change!
They are all bird-mad now, and imitate
The birds, and joy to do whate'er birds do.
Soon as they rise from bed at early dawn,
They settle down on laws, as we on lawns,
And then they brood upon their leaves and leaflets,
And feed their fill upon a crop of statutes.
So undisguised their madness, that full oft
The names of birds are fastened on to men.
One limping tradesman now is known as “Partridge”;
They dub *Menippus* “Swallow”; and *Opuntius*
“Blind Raven”; *Philocles* is “Crested Lark,”
*Theagenes* is nicknamed “Sheldrake” now;
*Lycurgus* “Ibis”; *Chaerephon* the “Vampire”;
And *Syracosius* “Jay”; whilst *Meidias* there
Is called the “Quail”; aye and he's like a quail
Flipped on the head by some quail-filliper.
So fond they are of birds that all are singing
Songs where a swallow figures in the verse,
Or goose, or may-be widgeon, or ring-dove,
Or wings, or even the scantiest shred of feather.
So much from earth. And let me tell you this;
More than ten thousand men will soon be here,
All wanting wings and taloned modes of life.
Somehow or other you must find them wings.

**Peisthetaerus:** O then, by *Zeus*, no time for dallying now;
Quick, run you in; collect the crates and baskets,
And fill them all with wings; that done, let *Manes*
Bring me them out; whilst I, remaining here,
Receive the wingless travellers as they come.

**Chorus:**
Very soon “fully-manned” will this City be called,
If men in such numbers invade us.

**Peisthetaerus:** So fortune continue to aid us.

**Chorus:**
O, the love of my City the world has enthralled!

**Peisthetaerus** (*to Manes*): Bring quicker the baskets they're packing.

**Chorus:**
For in what is it lacking
That a man for his home can require?
Here is Wisdom, and Wit, and each exquisite Grace,
And here the unruffled, benevolent face
Of Quiet, and loving Desire.

**Peisthetaerus:** Why, what a lazy loon are you!
Come, move a little faster, do.

**Chorus:**
O see that he brings me a basket of wings.
Rush out in a whirlwind of passion,
And wallop him, after this fashion.
For the rogue is as slow as a donkey to go.

**Peisthetaerus:** No pluck has your *Manes*, 'tis true.

**Chorus:**
But now 'tis for you
The wings in due order to set;
Both the musical wings, and the wings of the seers,
And the wings of the sea, that as each one appears,
The wings that he wants you can get.

**Peisthetaerus:** O, by the kestrels, I can't keep my hands
From banging you, you lazy, crazy oaf.

*Enter a sire-striker.*

**Sire-Striker** (singing):
O that I might as an eagle be,
Flying, flying, flying, flying
Over the surge of the untilled sea!

**Peisthetaerus:** Not false, methinks, the tale our envoy told us.
For here comes one whose song is all of eagles.

**Sire-Striker:** Fie on it!
There's nothing in this world so sweet as flying;
I've quite a passion for these same bird-laws.
In fact I'm gone bird-mad, and fly, and long
To dwell with you, and hunger for your laws.

**Peisthetaerus:** Which of our laws? for birds have many laws.

**Sire-Striker:** All! All! but most of all that jolly law
Which lets a youngster throttle and beat his father.

**Peisthetaerus:** Aye, if a cockerel beat his father here,
We do indeed account him quite a—Man.

**Sire-Striker:** That's why I moved up hither and would fain
Throttle my father and get all he has.

**Peisthetaerus:** But there's an ancient law among the birds,
You'll find it in the tablets of the storks:
> “When the old stork has brought his storklings up,
> And all are fully fledged for flight, then they
> Must in their turn maintain the stork their father.”

**Sire-Striker:** A jolly lot of good I've gained by coming,
If now I've got to feed my father too!

**Peisthetaerus:** Nay, my poor boy, you came here well-disposed,
And so I'll rig you like an orphan bird.
And here's a new suggestion, not a bad one,
But what I learnt myself when I was young.
Don't beat your father, lad; but take this wing,
And grasp this spur of battle in your hand,
And think this crest a game-cock's martial comb.
Now march, keep guard, live on your soldier's pay,
And let your father be. If you want fighting,
Fly off to *Thraceward* regions, and fight there.

**Sire-Striker:** By *Dionysus*, I believe you're right.
I'll do it too.

**Peisthetaerus:** You'll show your sense, by *Zeus*!

*Exit sire-striker; enter Cinesias.*

**Cinesias** (singing):
On the lightest of wings I am soaring on high,
Lightly from measure to measure I fly;

**Peisthetaerus:** Bless me, this creature wants a pack of wings!

**Cinesias** (singing):
And ever the new I am flitting to find,
With timorless body, and timorless mind.

**Peisthetaerus:** We clasp *Cinesias*, man of linden-wyth.
Why in the world have you whirled your splay foot hither?

**Cinesias** (singing):
To be a bird, a bird, I long,
A nightingale of thrilling song.

**Peisthetaerus:** O stop that singing; prithee speak in prose.

**Cinesias:** O give me wings, that I may soar on high,
And pluck poetic fancies from the clouds,
Wild as the whirling winds, and driving snows.

**Peisthetaerus:** What, do you pluck your fancies from the clouds?

**Cinesias:** Why our whole trade depends upon the clouds;

What are our noblest dithyrambs but things
Of air, and mist, and purple-gleaming depths,

And feathery whirl-wings? You shall hear, and
judge.

Pe. No, no, I won’t.
Ci. By Heracles you shall.
I’ll go through all the air, dear friend, for you.

(Singing) Shadowy visions of
Wing-spreading, air-treading,
Taper-necked birds.
Pe. Steady, there!
Ci. (singing) Bounding along on the path to the
seas,
Fain would I float on the stream of the breeze.
Pe. O by the Powers, I’ll stop your streams and
breezes.
Ci. (singing) First do I stray on a southerly way;
Then to the northward my body I bear,
Cutting a harbourless furrow of air.
*Peisthetaerus begins to flap him round the stage.*
A nice trick that, a pleasant trick, old man.
Pe. O you don’t like being feathery-whirl-
winged, do you?
Ci. That’s how you treat the Cyclian-chorus-
trainer
For whose possession all the tribes compete!
Pe. Well, will you stop and train a chorus here
For Leotrophides, all flying birds,
Crake-oppidans?
Ci. You’re jeering me, that’s plain.
But I won’t stop, be sure of that, until
I get me wings, and peragrate the air. *Exit Cinesias.*

*Enter Sycophant.*
Sycophant. (singing) Who be these on varied wing,
birds who have not anything?
O tell me, swallow, tell me, tell me true,
O long-winged bird, O bird of varied hue!
Pe. Come, it’s no joke, this plague that’s broken
out;
Here comes another, warbling like the rest.
Sy. (singing) Again I ask thee, tell me, tell me
true,
O long-winged bird, O bird of varied hue!
Pe. At his own cloak his catch appears to point;
More than one swallow that requires, I’m thinking.
Sy. Which is the man that wings the visitors?
Pe. He stands before you. What do you please to
want?
Sy. Wings, wings I want. You need not ask me
twice.
Pe. Is it Pellene that you’re going to fly to?
Sy. No, no: but I’m a sompnour for the Isles,
Informer—
Pe. O the jolly trade you’ve got!
Sy. And law-suit-hatcher; so I want the wings
To scare the cities, serving writs all round.
Pe. You’ll summon them more cleverly, I
suppose,
To the tune of wings?
Sy. No, but to dodge the pirates,
I’ll then come flying homeward with the cranes,
First swallowing down a lot of suits for ballast.
Pe. Is this your business? you, a sturdy youngster,
Live by informing on the stranger-folk?
Sy. What can I do? I never learnt to dig.
Pe. O, but by Zeus, there’s many an honest
calling
Whence men like you can earn a livelihood,
By means more suitable than hatching suits.

Sy. Come, come, no preaching; wing me, wing
me, please.
Pe. I wing you now by talking.
Sy. What, by talk
Can you wing men?
Pe. Undoubtedly. By talk
All men are winged.
Sy. All!
Pe. Have you never heard
The way the fathers in the barbers’ shops
Talk to the children, saying things like these,
“Diitrephes has winged my youngster so
By specious talk, he’s all for chariot-driving.”
“Aye,” says another, “and that boy of mine
Flutters his wings at every Tragic Play.”
Sy. So then by talk they are winged.
Pe. Exactly so.
Through talk the mind flutters and soars aloft,
And all the man takes wing. And so even now
I wish to turn you, winging you by talk,
To some more honest trade.
Sy. But I don't wish.
Pe. How then?
Sy. I’ll not disgrace my bringing up.
I’ll ply the trade my father’s fathers plied.
So wing me, please, with light quick-darting wings
Falcon’s or kestrel’s, so I’ll serve my writs
Abroad on strangers; then accuse them here;
Then dart back there again.
Pe. I understand.
So when they come, they’ll find the suit decided,
And payment ordered.
Sy. Right! you understand.
Pe. And while they’re sailing hither you’ll fly
there,
And seize their goods for payment.
Sy. That’s the trick!
Round like a top I’ll whizz.
Pe. I understand.
A whipping-top: and here by Zeus I’ve got
Fine Corcyraean wings to set you whizzing.
Sy. O, it’s a whip!
Pe. Nay, friend, a pair of wings,
To set you spinning round and round to-day.
*Striking him.*
Sy. O! O! O! O!
Pe. Come, wing yourself from hence.
Wobble away, you most confounded rascal!
I’ll make you spin! I’ll law-perverting-trick you!
Now let us gather up the wings and go.
*Exit Peisthetaerus with Sycophant.*

Chorus
We’ve been flying, we’ve been flying
Over sea and land, espying
Many a wonder strange and new.
First, a tree of monstrous girth,
Tall and stout, yet nothing worth,
For ’tis rotten through and through:
It has got no heart, and we
Heard it called “Cleonymus-tree.”
In the spring it blooms gigantic,
Fig-traducing, sycophantic,
Yet in falling leaf-time yields
Nothing but a fall of shields.
Next a spot by darkness skirted,
Spot, by every light deserted,
Lone and gloomy, we descried.
There the human and divine,
Men with heroes, mix and dine
Freely, save at even-tide.
’Tis not safe for mortal men
To encounter heroes then.
Then the great Orestes, looming
Vast and awful through the glooming,
On their right a stroke delivering,
Leaves them palsied, stript, and shivering.

*Enter Prometheus, concealing his face, probably recalling some scene in the Prometheus Fire-bringer of Aeschylus.*
Prometheus. O dear! O dear! Pray Heaven that
Zeus won’t see me!
Where’s Peisthetaerus?

*Enter Peisthetaerus.*
Pe. Why, whatever is here?
What’s this enwrapment?
Pro. See you any God
Following behind me there?
Pe. Not I, by Zeus.
But who are you?
Pro. And what’s the time of day?
Pe. The time of day? A little after noon.
(Shouting) But who are you?
Pro. Ox-loosing time, or later?
Pe. Disgusting idiot!
Pro. What’s Zeus doing now?
The clouds collecting or the clouds dispersing?
Pe. Out on you, stupid!
Pro. Now then, I’ll unwrap.
Pe. My dear Prometheus!
Pro. Hush! don’t shout like that.
Pe. Why, what’s up now?
Pro. Don’t speak my name so loudly.
’Twould be my ruin, if Zeus see me here.
But now I’ll tell you all that’s going on
Up in the sky, if you’ll just take the umbrella,
And hold it over, that no God may see me.
Pe. Ha! Ha!
The crafty thought! Prometheus-like all over.
Get under then; make haste: and speak out freely.
Pro. Then listen.
Pe. Speak: I’m listening, never fear.
Pro. All’s up with Zeus!
Pe. Good gracious me! since when?
Pro. Since first you built your city in the air.
For never from that hour does mortal bring
Burnt-offerings to the Gods, or savoury steam
Ascend to heaven from flesh of victims slain.
So now we fast a Thesmophorian fast,
No altars burning; and the Barbarian Gods
Half-starved, and gibbering like Illyrians, vow
That they’ll come marching down on Zeus, unless
He gets the marts reopened, and the bits
Of savory inwards introduced once more.
Pe. What, are there really other Gods, Bar-
barians,
Up above you?
Pro. Barbarians? Yes; thence comes
The ancestral God of Execestides.
Pe. And what’s the name of these Barbarian
Gods?
Pro. The name? Triballians.
Pe. Aye, I understand.
’Tis from that quarter Tribulation comes.
Pro. Exactly so. And now I tell you this;
Envoys will soon be here to treat for peace,
Sent down by Zeus and those Triballians there.
But make no peace, mind that, unless king Zeus
Restores the sceptre to the Birds again,
And gives yourself Miss Sovereignty to wife.
Pe. And who’s Miss Sovereignty?
Pro. The loveliest girl.
’Tis she who keeps the thunderbolts of Zeus,
And all his stores—good counsels, happy laws,
Sound common sense, dockyards, abusive speech,
All his three-obols, and the man who pays them.
Pe. Then she keeps everything!
Pro. Of course she does.
Win her from Zeus, and you'll have everything.
I hastened here that I might tell you this,
You know I am always well-disposed to men.
Pe. Aye, but for you we could not fry our fish.
Pro. And I hate every God, you know that, don’t
you?
Pe. Yes, hatred of the Gods; you always felt it.
Pro. A regular Timon! but ’tis time to go;
Let’s have the umbrella; then, if Zeus perceives
me,
He’ll think I’m following the Basket-bearer.
Pe. Here, take the chair, and act the Chair-girl
too.
*Exeunt Prometheus and Peisthetaerus.*

Chorus
Next we saw a sight appalling,
Socrates, unwashed, was calling
Spirits from the lake below,
(’Twas on that enchanted ground
Where the Shadow-feet are found).
There Peisander came to know
If the spirit cowards lack
Socrates could conjure back;
Then a camel-lamb he slew,
Like Odysseus, but withdrew,
Whilst the camel’s blood upon
Pounced the Vampire, Chaerephon.

*Enter Poseidon, Heracles, and Triballian.*
Poseidon. There, fellow envoys, full in sight, the
town
Whereto we are bound, Cloudcuckoobury, stands!
(To the Triballian)
You, what are you at, wearing your cloak left-
sided?
Shift it round rightly; so. My goodness, you’re
A born Laispodias! O Democracy,
What will you bring us to at last, I wonder,
If voting Gods elect a clown like this!
Triballian. Hands off there, will yer?
Pos. Hang you, you’re by far
The uncouthest God I ever came across.
Now, Heracles, what’s to be done?
Heracles. You have heard
What I propose; I’d throttle the man off-hand,
Whoever he is, that dares blockade the Gods.
Pos. My dear good fellow, you forget we are sent
To treat for peace.
Her. I’d throttle him all the more.

*Re-enter Peisthetaerus.*
Pe. (to servants) Hand me the grater; bring the silphium, you;
Now then, the cheese; blow up the fire a little.
Pos. We three, immortal Gods, with words of greet-
ing
Salute the Man!
Pe. I’m grating silphium now.
Her. What’s this the flesh of?
Pe. Birds! Birds tried and sentenced
For rising up against the popular party
Amongst the birds.
Her. Then you grate silphium, do you,
Over them first?
Pe. O welcome, Heracles!
What brings you hither?
Pos. We are envoys, sent
Down by the Gods to settle terms of peace.
*Servant.* There’s no more oil remaining in the flask.
Her. O dear! and bird’s-flesh should be rich and
glistering.
Pos. We Gods gain nothing by the war; and you,
Think what ye’ll get by being friends with us;
Rain-water in the pools, and halcyon days
Shall be your perquisites the whole year through.
We’ve ample powers to settle on these terms.
Pe. It was not we who ever wished for war,
And now, if even now ye come prepared
With fair proposals, ye will find us ready
To treat for peace. What I call fair is this;
Let Zeus restore the sceptre to the birds,
And all make friends. If ye accept this offer,
I ask the envoys in to share our banquet.
Her. I’m altogether satisfied, and vote—
Pos. (interrupting)
What, wretch? A fool and glutton, that’s what you
are!
What! would you rob your father of his kingdom?
Pe. Aye, say you so? Why, ye’ll be mightier far,
Ye Gods above, if Birds bear rule below.
Now men go skulking underneath the clouds,
And swear false oaths, and call the Gods to witness.
But when ye’ve got the Birds for your allies,
If a man swear by the Raven and by Zeus,
The Raven will come by, and unawares
Fly up, and swoop, and peck the perjurer’s eye out.
Pos. Now by Poseidon there’s some sense in that.
Her. And so say I.
Pe. (to Triballian) And you?

Tr. *Persuasitree.*
Pe. You see? he quite assents. And now I’ll give
you
Another instance of the good ye’ll gain.
If a man vow a victim to a God,
And then would shuffle off with cunning words,
Saying, in greedy lust, “The Gods wait long,”
This too we’ll make him pay you.
Pos. Tell me how?
Pe. Why, when that man is counting out his money,
Or sitting in his bath, a kite shall pounce
Down unawares, and carry off the price
Of two fat lambs, and bear it to the God.
Her. I say again, I vote we give the sceptre
Back to the Birds.
Pos. Ask the Triballian next.
Her. You there, do you want a drubbing?
Tr. *Hideythine I’se stickybea turns.*
Her. There! he’s all for me.
Pos. Well then, if so you wish it, so we’ll have it.
Her. (to Peisthetaerus) Hi! we accept your terms
about the sceptre.
Pe. By Zeus, there’s one thing more I’ve just re-
membered.
Zeus may retain his Hera, if he will,
But the young girl, Miss Sovereignty, he must
Give me to wife.
Pos. This looks not like a treaty.
Let us be journeying homewards.
Pe. As you will.
Now, cook, be sure you make the gravy rich.
Her. Why, man alive, Poseidon, where are you off
to?
What, are we going to fight about one woman?
Pos. What shall we do?
Her. Do? Come to terms at once.
Pos. You oaf, he’s gulling you, and you can’t see it.
Well, it’s yourself you are ruining. If Zeus
Restore the kingdom to the Birds, and die,
You’ll be a pauper. You are the one to get
Whatever money Zeus may leave behind him.
Pe. O! O! the way he’s trying to cozen you!
Hist, step aside, I want to whisper something.
Your uncle’s fooling you, poor dupe. By law
No shred of all your father’s money falls
To you. Why, you’re a bastard, you’re not heir.
Her. Eh! What? A bastard? I?
Pe. Of course you are.
Your mother was an alien. Bless the fool,
How did you think Athene could be “Heiress,”
(being a girl), if she had lawful brethren?
Her. Well, but suppose my father leaves me all
As bastard’s heritage?
Pe. The law won’t let him.
Poseidon here, who now excites you on,
Will be the first to claim the money then,
As lawful brother, and your father’s heir.
Why here, I’ll read you Solon’s law about it.
> “A bastard is to have no right of inheritance, if there
> be lawful children. And if there be no lawful chil-
> dren, the goods are to fall to the next of kin.”
Her. What! none of all my father’s goods to fall
To me?
Pe. No, not one farthing! tell me this,
Has he enrolled you ever in the guild?
Her. He never has. I’ve often wondered why.
Pe. Come, don’t look up assault-and-battery-wise.
Join us, my boy; I’ll make you autocrat,
And feed you all your days on pigeon’s milk.
Her. I’m quite convinced you’re right about the
girl:
I said Restore her; and I say so now.
Pe. (to Poseidon) And what say you?
Pos. I vote the other way.
Pe. All rests with this Triballian. What say you?
Tr. *Me gulna charmi grati Sovranau Birdito stori.*
Her. There! he said Restore her.
Pos. O no by Zeus, he never said Restore her;
He said to migrate as the swallows do.
Her. O then he said Restore her to the swallows.
Pos. You two conclude, and settle terms of peace,
Since you both vote it, I will say no more.
Her. (to Peisthetaerus) We’re quite prepared to
give you all you ask.
So come along, come up to heaven yourself,
And take Miss Sovereignty and all that’s there.
Pe. So then these birds were slaughtered just in
time
To grace our wedding banquet.
Her. Would you like me
To stay, and roast the meat, while you three go?
Pos. To roast the meat! To taste the meat, you mean.
Come along, do.
Her. I’d have enjoyed it though.
Pe. Ho there within! bring out a wedding robe.
*Exeunt Peisthetaerus, Poseidon, Triballian, and Heracles.*

Chorus
In the fields of Litigation,
Near the Water-clock, a nation
With its tongue its belly fills;
With its tongue it sows and reaps,
Gathers grapes and figs in heaps,
With its tongue the soil it tills.
For a Barbarous tribe it passes,
Philips all and Gorgiases.
And from this tongue-bellying band
Everywhere on Attic land,
People who a victim slay
Always cut the tongue away.

*Enter Messenger.*
Messenger. O all-successful, more than tongue can
tell!
O ye, thrice blessed winged race of birds,
Welcome your King returning to his halls!
He comes; no Star has ever gleamed so fair,
Sparkling refulgent in its gold-rayed home.
The full far-flashing splendour of the Sun
Ne’er shone so gloriously as he, who comes
Bringing a bride too beautiful for words,
Wielding the winged thunderbolt of Zeus.
Up to Heaven’s highest vault, sweet sight, ascends
Fragrance ineffable; while gentlest airs
The fume of incense scatter far and wide.
He comes; he is here! Now let the heavenly Muse
Open her lips with pure auspicious strains.

*Enter Peisthetaerus and Miss Sovereignty.*

Chorus
Back with you! out with you!
Off with you! up with you!
Flying around
Welcome the Blessed with blessedness crowned.
O! O! for the youth and the beauty, O!
Well hast thou wed for the town of the Birds.
Great are the blessings, and mighty, and wonderful,
Which through his favour our nation possesses.
Welcome them back, both himself and Miss Sov-
ereignty,
Welcome with nuptial and bridal addresses.
Mid just such a song hymenaean
Aforetime the Destinies led
The King of the thrones empyrean,
The Ruler of Gods, to the bed
Of Hera his beautiful bride.
*Hymen, O Hymenaeus!*
And Love, with his pinions of gold,
Came driving, all blooming and spruce,
As groomsman and squire to behold
The wedding of Hera and Zeus,
Of Zeus and his beautiful bride.
*Hymen, O Hymenaeus!*
*Hymen, O Hymenaeus!*

Pe. I delight in your hymns, I delight in your songs;
Your words I admire.
Ch. Now sing of the trophies he brings us from
Heaven,
The earth-crashing thunders, deadly and dire,
And the lightning’s angry flashes of fire,
And the dread white bolt of the levin.
Blaze of the lightning, so terribly beautiful,
Golden and grand!
Fire-flashing javelin, glittering ever in
Zeus’s right hand!
Earth-crashing thunder, the hoarsely resounding, the
Bringer of showers!
He is your Master, ’tis he that is shaking the
Earth with your powers!
All that was Zeus’s of old
Now is our hero’s alone;
Sovereignty, fair to behold,
Partner of Zeus on his throne,
Now is forever his own.
*Hymen, O Hymenaeus!*
Pe. Now follow on, dear feathered tribes,
To see us wed, to see us wed;
Mount up to Zeus’s golden floor,
And nuptial bed, and nuptial bed.
And O, my darling, reach thine hand,
And take my wing and dance with me,
And I will lightly bear thee up,
And carry thee, and carry thee.
Ch. Raise the joyous Paean-cry,
Raise the song of Victory.
*Io Paean, alalalae,*
Mightiest of the Powers, to thee!
