# The Knights

## Dramatis Personae

*   Demosthenes
*   Nicias
*   Sausage-Seller
*   Paphlagon
*   Demus
*   Chorus of Knights

*In the foreground is a loose arrangement of stones, which will, later on, be taken to represent the Pnyx. Behind are three houses; the central one, with a harvest-wreath over the door, is the abode of Demus; whilst the others serve for Paphlagon, who is Cleon, and the Sausage-Seller. Out of the house of Demus run two slaves, howling; their masks represent the two famous Athenian generals, Nicias and Demosthenes.*

**Demosthenes.** O! O! This Paphlagon, with all his wiles,
This newly-purchased pest, I wish the Gods
Would 'utterly abolish and destroy'!
For since he entered, by ill-luck, our house,
He’s always getting all the household flogged.

**Nicias.** I wish they would, this chief of Paphlagons,
Him and his lies!

**De.** Ha! how feel you, poor fellow?

**Ni.** Bad, like yourself.

**De.** Then come, and let us wail
A stave of old Olympus, both together.

**Both.** (sobbing) Mumu! Mumu! Mumu! Mumu! Mumu!

**De.** Pah! What’s the good of whimpering?
Better far
To dry our tears, and seek some way of safety.

**Ni.** Which way? You, tell me.

**De.** Rather, tell me you,
Or else we’ll fight.

**Ni.** By Apollo, no, not I.
You say it first, and then I’ll say it after.

**De.** O that thou saidst the thing that I would say!

**Ni.** I’ve not the pluck. I wish I could suggest
Some plan in smart Euripidean style.

**De.** Don’t do it! Don’t! Pray don’t be-chervil me,
But find some caper-cutting trick from master.

**Ni.** Will you say 'sert,' like that, speaking it crisply?

**De.** Of course I’ll say it, 'sert.'

**Ni.** Now, after 'sert'
Say 'de.'

**De.** 'De.'

**Ni.** Yes, that’s very nicely said.
Now, first say 'sert,' and then say 'de,' beginning
Slowly at first, but quickening as you go.

**De.** Aye; 'sert-de, sert-de, sert, de sert.'

**Ni.** There 'tis!
Do you not like it?

**De.** Like it, yes; but —

**Ni.** What?

**De.** There’s an uncanny sound about 'desert.'

**Ni.** Uncanny? How?

**De.** They flog deserters so.

**Ni.** O then ’twere better that we both should go,
And fall before the statues of the Gods.

**De.** Statues is it? What, do you really think
That there are Gods?

**Ni.** I know it.

**De.** Know it! How?

**Ni.** I’m such a wretched God-detested chap.

**De.** Well urged indeed; but seek some other way.
Would you I told the story to the audience?

**Ni.** Not a bad plan; but let us ask them first
To show us plainly by their looks and cheer
If they take pleasure in our words and acts.

**De.** I’ll tell them now. We two have got a master,
Demus of *Pnyx*-borough, such a sour old man,
Quick-tempered, country-minded, bean-consuming,
A trifle hard of hearing. Last new moon
He bought a slave, a tanner, Paphlagon,
The greatest rogue and liar in the world.
This tanning Paphlagon, he soon finds out
Master’s weak points; and cringing down before him
Flatters, and fawns, and wheedles, and cajoles,
With little apish leather-snippings, thus:
“O Demus, try one case, get the three-obol,
Then take your bath, gorge, guzzle, eat your fill.
Would you I set your supper?” Then he’ll seize
A dish some other servant has prepared,
And serve it up for master; and quite lately
I’d baked a rich Laconian cake at *Pylus*,
When in runs Paphlagon, and bags my cake,
And serves it up to Demus as his own.
But us he drives away, and none but he
Must wait on master; there he stands through dinner
With leathern flap, and flicks away the speakers.
And he chants oracles, till the dazed old man
Goes Sibyl-mad; then, when he sees him mooning,
He plies his trade. He slanders those within
With downright lies; so then we’re flogged, poor wretches,
And Paphlagon runs round, extorting, begging,
Upsetting everyone; and “Mark,” says he,
“There’s *Hylas* flogged; that’s all my doing; better
Make friends with me, or you’ll be trounced to-day.”
So then we bribe him off; or if we don’t,
We’re sure to catch it thrice as bad from master.
Now let’s excogitate at once, good fellow,
Which way to turn our footsteps, and to whom.

**Ni.** There’s nothing better than my 'sert', good fellow.

**De.** But nought we do is hid from Paphlagon.
His eyes are everywhere; he straddles out,
One foot in *Pylus*, in the Assembly one.
So vast his stride, that at the self-same moment
His seat is in *Chaonia*, and his hands
Are set on Begging, and his mind on Theft.

**Ni.** Well then, we had better die; but just consider
How we can die the manliest sort of death.

**De.** The manliest sort of death? Let’s see; which is it?

**Ni.** Had we not better drink the blood of bulls?
’Twere fine to die *Themistocles’* death.

**De.** Blood? no: pure wine, to the toast of Happy Fortune!
From that we’ll maybe get some happy thought.

**Ni.** Pure wine indeed! Is this a tippling matter?
How can one get, when drunk, a happy thought?

**De.** Aye, say you so, you water-fountain-twaddler?
And dare you rail at wine’s inventiveness?
I tell you nothing has such go as wine.
Why, look you now; ’tis when men drink, they thrive,
Grow wealthy, speed their business, win their suits,
Make themselves happy, benefit their friends.
Go, fetch me out a stoup of wine, and let me
Moisten my wits, and utter something bright.

**Ni.** O me, what good will all your tippling do?

**De.** Much; bring it out; I’ll lay me down awhile;
For when I’m drunk, I’ll everything bespatter
With little scraps of schemes, and plots, and plans.

*Nicias enters the house and returns with a bottle.*

**Ni.** I’ve got the wine; nobody saw me take it.
Wasn’t that luck?

**De.** What’s Paphlagon about?

**Ni.** Drunk! Snoring on his back amidst his hides,
The juggler; gorged with confiscation pasties.

**De.** Come, tinkle out a bumper of pure wine,
To pour.

**Ni.** Here, take; and pour to Happy Fortune.
Quaff, quaff the loving-cup of *Pramnian* Fortune.

**De.** O Happy Fortune, thine’s the thought, not mine!

**Ni.** Pray you, what is it?

**De.** Steal from Paphlagon,
While yet he sleeps, those oracles of his,
And bring them out.

**Ni.** I will; and yet I’m fearful
That I may meet with most unhappy Fortune.

*Enters house.*

**De.** Come now, I’ll draw the pitcher to myself,
Moisten my wits, and utter something bright.

**Ni.** (returning) Paphlagon’s snoring so! He never saw me.
I’ve got the sacred oracle which he keeps
So snugly.

**De.** O you clever fellow you,
I’ll read it; hand it over; you the while
Fill me the cup. Let’s see: what have we here?
O! Prophecies! Give me the cup directly.

**Ni.** Here! What do they say?

**De.** Fill me another cup.

**Ni.** “Fill me another?” Is that really there?

**De.** O *Bakis*!

**Ni.** Well?

**De.** Give me the cup directly.

**Ni.** *Bakis* seems mighty partial to the cup.

**De.** O villainous Paphlagon, this it was you feared,
This oracle about yourself!

**Ni.** What is it?

**De.** Herein is written how himself shall perish.

**Ni.** How shall he?

**De.** How? The oracle says straight out,
That first of all there comes an oakum-seller
Who first shall manage all the State’s affairs.

**Ni.** One something-seller; well, what follows, pray?

**De.** Next after him there comes a sheep-seller.

**Ni.** Two something-sellers; what’s this seller’s fortune?

**De.** He’ll hold the reins, till some more villainous rogue
Arise than he; and thereupon he’ll perish.
Then follows Paphlagon, our leather-seller,
Thief, brawler, roaring as *Cycloborus* roars.

**Ni.** The leather-seller, then, shall overthrow
The sheep-seller?

**De.** He shall.

**Ni.** O wretched me,
Is there no other something-seller left?

**De.** There is yet one; a wondrous trade he has.

**Ni.** What, I beseech you?

**De.** Shall I tell you?

**Ni.** Aye.

**De.** A sausage-seller ousts the leather-seller.

**Ni.** A sausage-seller! Goodness, what a trade!
Wherever shall we find one?

**De.** That’s the question.

**Ni.** Why here comes one, ’tis providential surely,
Bound for the *agora*.

**De.** Hi, come hither! here!
You dearest man, you blessed Sausage-Seller!
Arise, a Saviour to the State and us.

*Enter Sausage-Seller.*

**S.-S.** Eh! What are you shouting at?

**De.** Come here this instant,
And hear your wonderful amazing luck.

**Ni.** Make him put down his dresser; tell him all
The news about that oracle we’ve got.
I’ll keep an eye on Paphlagon the while.

*Exit Nicias.*

**De.** Come, put you down those cookery implements,
Then make your reverence to the Gods and earth—

**S.-S.** There! what’s the row?

**De.** O happy man, and rich,
Nothing to-day, to-morrow everything!
O mighty ruler of Imperial Athens!

**S.-S.** Good fellow, let me wash the guts, and sell
My sausages. What need to flout me so?

**De.** You fool! the guts indeed! Now look you here.
You see those people on the tiers?

**S.-S.** I do.

**De.** You shall be overlord of all those people,
The *Agora*, and the Harbours, and the *Pnyx*.
You’ll trim the Generals, trample down the Council,
Fetter, imprison, make the Hall your brothel.

**S.-S.** What, I?

**De.** Yes, you yourself! And that’s not all.
For mount you up upon the dresser here
And view the islands all around.

**S.-S.** I see.

**De.** And all the marts and merchant-ships?

**S.-S.** I see.

**De.** And aren’t you then a lucky man?
And that’s not all. Just cast your eyes askew,
The right to *Caria*, and the left to *Carthage*.

**S.-S.** A marvellous lucky man, to twist my neck!

**De.** Nay, but all these shall be your perquisites.
You shall become, this oracle declares,
A Man most mighty!

**S.-S.** Humbug! How can I,
A sausage-selling chap, become a Man?

**De.** Why, that’s the very thing will make you great,
Your roguery, impudence, and *agora*-training.

**S.-S.** I am not worthy of great power, methinks.

**De.** O me, not worthy! what’s the matter now?
You’ve got, I fear, some good upon your conscience.
Spring you from gentlemen?

**S.-S.** By the powers, not I.
From downright blackguards.

**De.** Lucky, lucky man,
O what a start you’ve got for public life.

**S.-S.** But I know nothing, friend, beyond my letters,
And even of them but little, and that badly.

**De.** The mischief is that you know anything.
To be a Demus-leader is not now
For lettered men, nor yet for honest men,
But for the base and ignorant. Don’t let slip
The bright occasion which the Gods provide you.

**S.-S.** How goes the oracle?

**De.** Full of promise good,
Wrapped up in cunning, enigmatic words:
“Nay, but if once the Eagle, the black-tanned,
mandible-curver,
Seize with his beak the Serpent, the dullard, the
drinker of life-blood,
Then shall the sharp sour brine of the Paphlagon
tribe be extinguished,
Then to the entrail-sellers shall God great glory
and honour
Render, unless they elect to continue the sale of
the sausage.”

**S.-S.** But what in the world has this to do with me?

**De.** The black-tanned Eagle, that means Paphlagon.

**S.-S.** And what the mandibles?

**De.** That’s self-evident.
His fingers, crooked to carry off their prey.

**S.-S.** What does the Serpent mean?

**De.** That’s plainer still.
A serpent’s long; a sausage too is long.
Serpents drink blood, and sausages drink blood.
The Serpent then, it says, shall overcome
The black-tanned Eagle, if it’s not talked over.

**S.-S.** I like the lines: but how can I, I wonder,
Contrive to manage Demus’ affairs.

**De.** Why nothing’s easier. Do what now you do:
Mince, hash, and mash up everything together.
Win over Demus with the savoury sauce
Of little cookery phrases. You’ve already
Whatever else a Demagogue requires.
A brutal voice, low birth, an *agora*-training;
Why you’ve got all one wants for public life.
The *Pythian* shrine and oracles concur.
Crown, crown your head; pour wine to mighty Dulness;
Prepare to fight the man.

**S.-S.** But what ally
Will stand beside me, for the wealthy men
Tremble before him, and the poor folk blench.

**De.** A thousand Knights, all honest men and true,
Detest the scoundrel, and will help the cause;
And whosoe’er is noblest in the State,
And whosoe’er is brightest in the tiers,
And I myself. And God will lend his aid.
And fear him not; he is not pictured really;
For all the mask-providers feared to mould
His actual likeness; but our audience here
Are shrewd and bright; they’ll recognize the man.

*Enter Nicias.*

**Ni.** Mercy upon us! here comes Paphlagon.

*Enter Paphlagon.*

**Paphlagon.** By the Twelve Gods, you two shall pay for this.
Always conspiring, plotting ill to Demus!
What’s this Chalcidian goblet doing here?
Hah! ye’re inciting *Chalcis* to revolt.
Villains and traitors! ye shall die the death.

**De.** (to Sausage-Seller) Hi! where are you off to? Stop! For goodness’ sake,
Don’t fail us now, most doughty Sausage-Seller!

*The Chorus of Knights enter the orchestra.*

**Chorus.** Hasten up, my gallant horsemen,
now’s the time your foe to fight.
Now then *Simon*, now *Panaetius*,
charge with fury on the right.
Here they’re coming! Worthy fellow,
wheel about, commence the fray;
Lo, the dust of many horsemen
rushing on in close array!
Turn upon him, fight him, smite him,
scout him, rout him, every way.
Smite the rascal, smite him, smite him,
troubler of our Knightly train,
Foul extortioner, *Charybdis*,
bottomless abyss of gain.
Smite the rascal; smite the rascal;
many times the word I’ll say,
For he proved himself a rascal
many, many times a day.
Therefore smite him, chase him, pound him,
rend and rattle and confound him!
Show your loathing, show as we do;
press with angry shouts around him.
Take you heed, or he’ll evade you;
watch him closely, for the man
Knows how *Eucrates* escaped us,
fleeing to his stores of bran.

**Pa.** O my *Heliastic* veterans,
of the great *Triobol* clan,
Whom through right and wrong I nourish,
bawling, shouting all I can,
Help me, by conspiring traitors
shamefully abused and beaten.

**Ch.** Rightly, for the public commons
you before your turn have eaten,
And you squeeze the audit-passers,
pinching them like figs, to try
Which is ripe, and which is ripening,
which is very crude and dry.
Find you one of easy temper,
mouth agape, and vacant look,
Back from *Chersonese* you bring him,
grasp him firmly, fix your hook.
Twist his shoulder back and, glibly,
gulp the victim down at once.
And you search amongst the townsmen
for some lambkin-witted dunce,
Wealthy, void of tricks and malice,
shuddering at disputes and fuss.

**Pa.** You assail me too, my masters?
’tis for you they beat me thus;
’Tis because I thought of moving
that ’twere proper here to make
Some memorial of your worships
for your noble valour’s sake.

**Ch.** Hear him trying to cajole us!
O the supple-bending sneak,
Playing off his tricks upon us,
as on dotards old and weak.
Nay, but there my arm shall smite him
if to pass you there he seek;
If he dodge in this direction,
here against my leg he butts.

**Pa.** Athens! Demus! see the monsters,
see them punch me in the guts.

**Ch.** Shouting, are you? you who always
by your shouts subvert the town.

**S.-S.** But in this I’ll first surpass him;
thus I shout the fellow down.

**Ch.** If in bawling you defeat him,
sing we ho! for Victory’s sake.
If in shamelessness you beat him,
then indeed we take the cake.

**Pa.** I denounce this smuggling fellow;
contraband of war he takes
For the Peloponnesian galleys,
frapping them with—girdle-cakes.

**S.-S.** I denounce this juggling fellow;
at the Hall, from day to day,
In he runs with empty belly,
with a full one hies away.

**Ch.** Fish, and flesh, and bread exporting,
and a hundred things like these,
Contraband of peace, which never
were allowed to *Pericles*.

**Pa.** Death awaits you at once, you two.

**S.-S.** Thrice as loud can I squall as you.

**Pa.** Now will I bawl you down by bawling.

**S.-S.** Now will I squall you down by squalling.

**Pa.** Lead our armies, and I’ll backbite you.

**S.-S.** I’ll with dog-whips slash you and smite you.

**Pa.** I’ll outwit you by fraud and lying.

**S.-S.** I’ll your pettitoes chop for frying.

**Pa.** Now unblinking regard me, you.

**S.-S.** I was bred in the *agora* too.

**Pa.** Say but g-r-r, and to strips I’ll tear you.

**S.-S.** Speak one word, and as dung I’ll bear you.

**Pa.** I confess that I steal. Do you?

**S.-S.** *Agora Hermes*! yes, I do.
If I’m seen, I’m a perjurer too.

**Pa.** Somebody else’s tricks you’re vaunting;
Now to the *Prytanes* off I’ll run,
Tell them you’ve got some holy pig-guts.
Tell them you’ve paid no tithe thereon.

**Ch.** O villain, O shameless of heart,
O Bawler and Brawler, self-seeking,
The land, the Assembly, the Tolls,
are all with thine impudence reeking,
And the Courts, and the actions at law;
they are full unto loathing and hate!
Thou stirrest the mud to its depths,
perturbing the whole of the State.
Ruffian, who hast deafened Athens
with thine everlasting din,
Watching from the rocks the tribute,
tunny-fashion, shoaling in.

**Pa.** Well I know the very quarter
where they cobbled up the plot.

**S.-S.** You’re a knowing hand at cobbling,
else in mincing meat I’m not;
You who cheated all the rustics
with a flabby bullock-hide,
Cutting it aslant to make it
look like leather firm and dried;
In a day, the shoes you sold them
wobbled half a foot too wide.

**Ni.** That’s the very trick the rascal
played the other day on me.
And my friends and fellow burghers
laughed with undissembled glee,
I was swimming in my slippers
ere I got to *Pergasae*.

**Ch.** So then thou hast e’en from the first
that shameless bravado displayed
Which alone is the Orators’ Patron.
And foremost of all by its aid
Thou the wealthy strangers milkest,
draining off their rich supplies;
And the son of *Hippodamus*
watches thee with streaming eyes.
Ah, but another has dawned on us now,
Viler and fouler and coarser than thou,
Viler and fouler and coarser by far,
One who’ll beat thee and defeat thee
(therefore jubilant we are),
Beat thee in jackanapes tricks and rascality,
Beat thee in impudence, cheek, and brutality.
O trained where Men are trained who best
deserve that appellation,
Now show us of how little worth
is liberal education.

**S.-S.** The sort of citizen he is, I’ll first expose to view.

**Pa.** Give me precedence.

**S.-S.** No, by Zeus, for I’m a blackguard too.

**Ch.** And if to that he yield not, add “as all my fathers were.”

**Pa.** Give me precedence.

**S.-S.** No, by Zeus.

**Pa.** O yes, by Zeus.

**S.-S.** I swear
I’ll fight you on that very point; you never shall be first.

**Pa.** O, I shall burst.

**S.-S.** You never shall.

**Ch.** O let him, let him burst.

**Pa.** How dare you try in speech to vie
with me? On what rely you?

**S.-S.** Why I can speak first-rate, and eke
with piquant sauce supply you.

**Pa.** O speak you can! and you’re the man,
I warrant, who is able
A mangled mess full well to dress,
and serve it up to table.
I know your case, the common case;
against some alien folk
You had some petty suit to plead,
and fairly well you spoke.
For oft you’d conned the speech by night,
and in the streets discussed it,
And, quaffing water, shown it off,
and all your friends disgusted.
Now you’re an orator, you think.
O fool, the senseless thought!

**S.-S.** Pray what’s the draught which you have quaffed
that Athens you have brought
Tongue-wheedled by yourself alone
to sit so mute and still?

**Pa.** Who to compare with me will dare?
I’ll eat my tunny grill,
And quaff thereon a stoup of wine
which water shall not touch,
And then with scurrilous abuse
the Pylian generals smutch.

**S.-S.** I’ll eat the paunch of cow and swine,
and quaff thereon their stew,
And rising from the board with hands
which water never knew
I’ll throttle all the orators, and flutter Nicias too.

**Ch.** With all beside I’m satisfied,
but one thing likes me not,
You speak as if you ate alone
whatever stew you’ve got.

**Pa.** You’ll not consume your basse and then
*Miletus* bring to grief.

**S.-S.** But mines I’ll purchase when I’ve first
devoured my ribs of beef.

**Pa.** I’ll leap the Council-chamber in,
and put them all to rout.

**S.-S.** I’ll treat you like a sausage-skin,
and twirl your breech about.

**Pa.** I’ll hoist you by your crupper up,
and thrust you through the gate, sir.

**Ch.** If him you thrust, me too you must;
you must as sure as fate, sir.

**Pa.** Your feet in the stocks I’ll fix full tight.

**S.-S.** And you for your cowardice I’ll indict.

**Pa.** Outstretched on my board your hide I’ll pin.

**S.-S.** 'Pickpocket’s purse' I’ll make your skin.

**Pa.** Your limbs on the tanhouse floor I’ll stake.

**S.-S.** Your flesh into force-meat balls I’ll bake.

**Pa.** I’ll twitch the lashes off both your eyes.

**S.-S.** I’ll cut your gizzard out, poulterer-wise.

**De.** Prop open his mouth with all your strength;
Insert the extender from jaw to jaw;
Pull out his tongue to its utmost length,
And, butcher-fashion, inspect his maw,
And whilst his gape is so broad and fine,
See if he’s not. The symptoms got
Which show that he’s nought but a measly swine.

**Ch.** There are things, then, hotter than fire;
there are speeches more shameless still
Than the shameless speeches of those
who rule the City at will.
No trifling task is before you;
upon him and twist and garrote him.
Do nought that is little or mean;
for round the waist you have got him.
If in this assault you knead him
limp and supple to your hand,
You will find the man a craven;
I his habits understand.

**S.-S.** Truly for an arrant coward
he has all his life been known;
Yet a Man he seemed but lately,
reaping where he had not sown.
Now the ears of corn he brought us,
he aspires to parch and dry,
Shuts them up in wood and fetters,
hopes to sell them by and by.

**Pa.** You and your allies I fear not,
while the Council lives, and while
Demus moons upon the benches
with his own unmeaning smile.

**Ch.** O see how he brazens it out!
The colour remains as before
In his shameless impudent face.
And O, if I hate you not sore,
Let me be a filthy sheepskin,
that whereon *Cratinus* lay,
Or let *Morsimus* instruct me
as the Chorus to his Play.
Thou in all places, and thou at all hours,
Flitting and sitting in bribery flowers,
Sucking and sipping the gold they contain,
Mayest thou lightly, as ’twas swallowed,
cast thy mouthful up again.
Then will I ever the roundelay sing
'Drink for the luck which the Destinies bring,'
And old *Iulius’* son, the pander *Prytanean*,
For joy will 'Bacche-Bacchus' shout,
and chant his *Io-Paean*.

**Pa.** Think you in shamelessness to win?
No, by *Poseidon*, no!
Or may I evermore the feasts
of *Agora Zeus* forgo.

**S.-S.** Now by the knuckles which in youth
would discipline my head,
And those hard-handled butchers’ knives
they often used instead,
I think in shamelessness I’ll win;
else vainly in the slums
Have I to such a bulk been reared
on finger-cleaning crumbs.

**Pa.** On finger-pellets like a dog?
And reared on these, you seek
To fight a dog-faced fierce baboon!
I marvel at your cheek.

**S.-S.** And lots of other monkey-tricks
I practised as a boy.
O how I used to chouse the cooks
by shrieking out 'Ahoy!
Look lads, a swallow! spring is here.
Look up, look up, I pray.'
So up they looked whilst I purloined
a piece of meat away.

**Ch.** Shrewd body, you were provident,
and stole away your meat
Before the vernal swallow came,
as folk their nettles eat.

**S.-S.** And no one caught me out, or else,
if any saw me pot it,
I clapped the meat between my thighs
and vowed I hadn’t got it;
Whereat an orator observed,
who watched me at my tricks,
'Some day this boy will make his mark
as leader in the *Pnyx*.'

**Ch.** His inference was just; but still
’tis plain from whence he drew it;
He saw you filch the meat away,
and swear you didn’t do it.

**Pa.** I’ll stop your insolence, my man;
your friend’s and yours together.
I’ll swoop upon you like a gale
of fresh and stormy weather,
And all the land and all the sea
in wild confusion throw.

**S.-S.** But I will furl my sausages,
and down the tide will go
With prosperous seas, and favouring breeze,
at you my fingers snapping.

**De.** And if your bark a leak should spring,
the water I’ll be tapping.

**Pa.** Full many a talent have you filched,
and dearly shall you pay,
You public-treasury thief!

**Ch.** Look out, and slack the sheet away,
I hear a loud Nor’-Easter there
or Sycophanter blow.

**Pa.** From *Potidaea* you received
ten talents, that I know.

**S.-S.** Will you take one, and hold your tongue?

**Ch.** He’d take it like a shot.

**S.-S.** Let out the yard-arm ropes a bit.
The gale has milder got.
The stormy blast is falling fast.

**Pa.** You’ll have, for bribery and deceit,
Four hundred-talent writs to meet.

**S.-S.** And you, for cowardliness a score,
For theft a thousand writs and more.

**Pa.** From that old sacrilegious race
I’ll say that your descent you trace.

**S.-S.** Your father’s father marched, I’ll swear,
As bodyguard to—

**Pa.** Whom? Declare!

**S.-S.** To *Hippias’ Byrsine*.

**Pa.** You jackanapes!

**S.-S.** You gallows-tree!

**Ch.** Strike like a man!

**Pa.** O help me! Oh!
These plotting traitors hurt me so.

**Ch.** Strike, strike him, well and manfully,
And with those entrails beat him,
And strings of sausage-meat, and try
Meet punishment to mete him.
O noblest flesh in all the world,
O spirit best and dearest,
To City and to citizens
a Saviour thou appearest.
How well and with what varied skill
thou foilst him in debate!
O would that I could praise you so,
as our delight is great.

**Pa.** Now, by *Demeter*, it escaped me not
That these same plots were framing; well I knew
How they were pegged, and fixed, and glued together.

**Ch.** O, me!
*(to Sausage-Seller)* Can’t you say something from the Cartwright’s trade?

**S.-S.** These *Argos* doings have escaped me not.
He goes, he says, to make a friend of *Argos*,
But ’tis with *Sparta* he’s colloguing there.
Aye and I know the anvil whereupon
His plan is forged: ’tis welded on the captives.

**Ch.** Good! good! return him welding for his glue.

**S.-S.** And men from thence are hammering at it too.
And not by bribes of silver or of gold
Or sending friends, will you persuade me not
To tell the Athenians how you are going on.

**Pa.** I’ll go this instant to the Council-board,
And all your vile conspiracies denounce,
And all your nightly gatherings in the town,
And how you plotted with the Medes and King,
And all your cheese-pressed doings in *Boeotia*.

**S.-S.** Pray, how’s cheese selling in *Boeotia* now?

**Pa.** I’ll stretch you flat, by *Heracles* I will. *Exit.*

**Ch.** Now then, what mean you? what are you going to do?

Now shall you show us if in very truth
You stole the meat and hid it as you said.
So to the Council-house you’ll run, for he
Will burst in thither, and against us all
Utter his lies and bawl a mighty bawl.

S.-S. Well, I will go; but first I’ll lay me down
Here, as I am, these guts and butchers’-knives.

Demosthenes. Here take this ointment and anoint your
neck,
So can you slip more easily through his lies.

S.-S. Well now, that’s good and trainer-like
advice.

Demosthenes. And next, take this and swallow it.

S.-S. What for?

Demosthenes. Why, if you are garlic-primed, you’ll fight
much better.
And now begone.

S.-S. I’m off. *Exit*.

Demosthenes. And don’t forget
To peck, to lie, to gobble down his combs,
And bite his wattles off. That done, return. *Exit*.

Chorus
Good-bye and good speed: may your daring
succeed,
And Zeus of the *Agora* help you in need.
May you conquer in fight, and return to our sight
A Victor triumphant with garlands bedight.
But ye to our anapaests listen the while,
And give us the heed that is due,
Ye wits, who the Muse of each pattern and style
Yourselves have attempted to woo.
If one of the old-fashioned Comedy-bards
had our services sought to impress,
And make us before the spectators appear,
to deliver the public address,
He would not have easily gained us; but now,
with pleasure we grant the request
Of a poet who ventures the truth to declare,
and detests what we also detest,
And against the Tornado and Whirlwind, alone,
with noble devotion advances.
But as for the question that puzzles you most,
so that many in inquire how it chances
That he never a Chorus had asked for himself,
or attempted in person to vie,
On this we’re commissioned his views to explain,
and this is the Poet’s reply;
That ’twas not from folly he lingered so long,
but discerning by shrewd observation
That Comedy-Chorus-instruction is quite
the most difficult thing in creation.
For out of the many who courted the Muse
she has granted her favours to few,
While e’en as the plants that abide but a year,
so shifting and changeful are you;
And the Poets who flourished before him, he saw,
ye were wont in their age to betray.

Observing the treatment which Magnes received
when his hair was besprinkled with grey,
Than whom there was none more trophies had won
in the fields of dramatic display.
All voices he uttered, all forms he assumed,
the Lydian, the fig-piercing Fly,
The Harp with its strings, the Bird with its wings,
the Frog with its yellow-green dye.
Yet all was too little; he failed in the end,
when the freshness of youth was gone by,
And at last in his age he was hissed from the stage
when lost was his talent for jeering.
Then he thought of Cratinus who flowed through
the plains
’mid a tumult of plaudits and cheering;
And sweeping on all that obstructed his course,
with a swirl from their stations he tore them,
Oaks, rivals, and planes; and away on his flood
uprooted and prostrate he bore them.
And never a song at a banquet was sung
but "*Doro fig-sandaled and true*,"
Or "*Framers of terse and artistical verse*,"
such a popular poet he grew.
Yet now that he drivels and dotes in the streets,
and Time of his ambers has reft him,
And his framework is gaping asunder with age,
and his strings and his music have left him,
No pity ye show; no assistance bestow;
but allow him to wander about
Like *Connas*, with coronal withered and sere,
and ready to perish with drought;
Who ought for his former achievements to drink
in the Hall, nor be laid on the shelf,
But to sit in the Theatre shining and bright,
beside Dionysus himself.
And then he remembered the stormy rebuffs
which Crates endured in his day,
Who a little repast at a little expense
would provide you, then send you away;
Who the daintiest little devices would cook
from the driest of mouths for you all;
Yet he, and he only held out to the end,
now standing, now getting a fall.
So in fear of these dangers he lingered; besides,
a sailor, he thought, should abide
And tug at the oar for a season, before
he attempted the vessel to guide;
And next should be stationed awhile at the prow,
the winds and the weather to scan;
And then be the Pilot, himself for himself.
So seeing our Poet began
In a mood so discreet, nor with vulgar conceit
rushed headlong before you at first,
Loud surges of praise to his honour upraise;
salute him, all hands, with a burst
Of hearty triumphant Lenaean applause,
That the bard may depart, all radiant and bright
To the top of his forehead with joy and delight,
Having gained, by your favour, his cause.

Dread Poseidon, the Horseman’s King,
Thou who lovest the brazen clash,
Clash and neighing of warlike steeds;
Pleased to watch where the trireme speeds
Purple-beaked, to the oar’s long swing,
Winning glory (and pay); but chief
Where bright youths in their chariots flash
Racing (coming perchance to grief);
Cronus' son,
Throned on Geraestus and Sunium bold,
Swaying thy dolphins with trident of gold,
Come, O come, at the call of us;
Dearest to Phormio thou,
Yea and dearest to all of us,
Dearest to all of us now.

Let us praise our mighty fathers,
men who ne’er would quake or quail,
Worthy of their native country,
worthy of Athena’s veil;
Men who with our fleets and armies
everywhere the victory won,
And adorned our ancient city
by achievements nobly done.
Never stayed they then to reckon
what the numbers of the foe,
At the instant that they saw him,
all their thought was “At him go!”
If they e’er in desperate struggling
on their shoulder chanced to fall,
Quick they wiped away the dust-mark,
swore they ne’er were thrown at all,
Closed again in deadly grapple.
None of all our generals brave
Then had stooped a public banquet
from Cleaenetus to crave.
Now unless ye grant them banquets,
grant precedence as their right,
They will fight no more, they tell you.
Our ambition is to fight
Freely for our Gods and country,
as our fathers fought before,
No reward or pay receiving;
asking this and nothing more,
When returning Peace shall set us
free from all our warlike toil,
Grudge us not our flowing ringlets,
grudge us not our baths and oil.

595-635
Holy Pallas, our guardian Queen,
Ruling over the holiest land,
Land poetic, renowned, and strong,
First in battle and first in song,
Land whose equal never was seen,
Come to prosper our Choral band!
Bring thou with thee the Maiden bright,
Her who greets us in every fight,
Victory!
She in the choir-competition abides with us,
Always against our antagonists sides with us.
Come, great Goddess, appear to us,
Now, if ever, we pray,
Bring thou victory dear to us,
Crown thine Horsemen to-day.

What we witnessed with our horses
we desire to eulogize.
Worthy they of praise and honour!
many a deed of high emprize,
Many a raid and battle-onset
they with us have jointly shared.
Yet their feats ashore surprise not,
with their feats afloat compared,
When they bought them cans and garlic,
bought them strings of onions too,
Leapt at once aboard the transports,
all with manful hearts and true,
Took their seats upon the benches,
dipped their oar-blades in the sea,
Pulled like any human beings,
neighing out their Hippapae!
“Pull my hearties, pull your strongest,
don’t be shirking, Sigma-brand!”
Then they leapt ashore at Corinth,
and the youngest of the band
Hollowed with their hoofs their couches
or for bedding searched about.
And they fed on crabs, for clover,
if they met one crawling out,
Or detected any lurking
in the Ocean’s deepest bed.
Till at length a crab of Corinth,
so Theorus tells us, said:
“Hard it is, my Lord Poseidon,
if the Knights we cannot flee
Even in the depths of Ocean, anywhere by land or
sea.”

*Enter the Sausage-Seller*.
Chorus. Dearest of men, my lustiest, trustiest friend,
Good lack! how anxious has your absence made us!
But now that safe and sound you are come again,
Say what has happened, and how went the fight.

S.-S. How else but thus? The Council-victor I.

Chorus. Now may we, joyous, raise the song of sacred
praise.
Fair the words you speak, but fairer
Are the deeds you do.
Far I’d go, This I know,
But to hear them through.
Now then tell us all the story,
All that, where you went, befell;
Fearless be, Sure that we
All delight in all you tell.

S.-S. Aye, and ’tis worth the hearing. When behind
him
I reached the Council-chamber, there was he
Crashing and dashing, hurling at the Knights
Strange wonder-working thunder-driving words,
Calling them all, with all-persuading force,
Conspirators! And all the Council, hearing,
Grew full of lying orach at his talk,
Wore mustard looks, and puckered up their brows.
So when I saw them taking in his words,
Gulled by his knavish tricks, “Ye Gods,” said I,
“Ye Gods of knavery, *Skitals*, and *Phenaces*,
And ye *Beresceths*, *Cobals*, *Mothon*, and

THE KNIGHTS

636-693
Thou *Agora*, whence my youthful training came,
Now give me boldness and a ready tongue
And shameless voice!” And as I pondered thus,
I heard a loud explosion on my right,
And made my reverence; then I dashed apart
The railing-wicket, opened wide my mouth,
And cried aloud, “O Council, I have got
Some lovely news which first I bring to you.
For never, never, since the War broke out,
Have I seen pilchards cheaper than to-day.”
They calmed their brows and grew serene at once,
And crowned me for my news; and I suggested,
Bidding them keep it secret, that forthwith,
To buy these pilchards, many for a penny,
’Twere best to seize the cups in all the shops.
They clapped their hands, and turned agape to me.
But Paphlagon perceived, and well aware
What kind of measures please the Council best,
Proposed a resolution; “Sirs,” quoth he,
“I move that for these happy tidings brought,
One hundred beeves be offered to Athena.”
The Council instantly inclined to him.
So, overpowered with cow-dung, in a trice
I overshot him with “two hundred beeves.”
And “vow,” said I, “to slay to-morrow morn,
If pilchards sell one hundred for an obol,
A thousand she-goats to our huntress Queen.”
Back came their heads, expectantly, to me.
He, dazed at this, went babbling idly on;
So then the Prytanes and the Archers seized him.
And they stood up, and raved about the pilchards;
And he kept begging them to wait awhile
And hear the tale the Spartan envoy brings;
“He has just arrived about a peace,” shrieked he.
But all the Council with one voice exclaimed,
“What! Now about a peace? No doubt, my man,
Now they’ve heard pilchards are so cheap at Athens!
We want no truces; let the War go on!”
With that, “Dismiss us, Prytanes!” shouted they;
And overleaped the railings everywhere.
And I slipped out, and purchased all the leeks
And all the coriander in the market;
And as they stood perplexed, I gave them all
Of my free bounty garnish for their fish.
And they so praised and purred about me, that
With just one obol’s worth of coriander
I’ve all the Council won, and here I am.

Chorus. What rising men should do
Has all been done by you.
He, the rascal, now has met a
Bigger rascal still,
Full of guile Plot and wile,
Full of knavish skill.
Mind you carry through the conflict
In the same undaunted guise.
Well you know Long ago
We’re your faithful true allies.

S.-S. See here comes Paphlagon, driving on be¬
fore him
A long ground-swell, all fuss and fury, thinking
To drink me up. Boh! for your impudent bluster.

*Enter Paphlagon*.

478

694-743
Paphlagon. O if I’ve any of my old lies left,
And don’t destroy you, may I fall to bits!

S.-S. I like your threats; I’m wonderfully tickled
To hear you fume; I skip and cuckoo around you.

Paphlagon. O by Demeter, if I eat you not
Out of the land, I’ll never live at all.

S.-S. You won’t? Nor I, unless I drink you up,
And swill you up, and burst myself withal.

Paphlagon. I’ll crush you, by my Pylus-won precedence.

S.-S. Precedence, is it? I’m in hopes to see you
In the last tier, instead of here in front.

Paphlagon. By Heaven, I’ll clap you in the public stocks.

S.-S. How fierce it’s growing! what would it like
to eat?
What is its favourite dainty? Money-bags?

Paphlagon. I’ll tear your guts out with my nails, I will.

S.-S. I’ll scratch your Town Hall dinners out,
I will.

Paphlagon. I’ll hale you off to Demus; then you’ll catch it.

S.-S. Nay, I’ll hale you, and then out-slander you.

Paphlagon. Alack, poor chap, he pays no heed to you,
But I can fool him to my heart’s content.

S.-S. How sure you seem that Demus is your own!

Paphlagon. Because I know the titbits he prefers.

S.-S. And feed him badly as the nurses do.
You chew, and pop a morsel in his mouth,
But thrice as much you swallow down yourself.

Paphlagon. And I’m so dexterous-handed, I can make
Demus expand, and then contract again.

S.-S. I can do that with many things, I trow.

Paphlagon. ’Twon’t be like bearding me in the Council
now!
No, come along to Demus.

S.-S. Aye, why not?
I’m ready; march; let nothing stop us now.

Paphlagon. O Demus, come out here.

S.-S. O yes, by Zeus,
Come out, my father.

Paphlagon. Dearest darling Demus,
Come out, and hear how they’re ill-treating me!

*Enter Demus and Demosthenes*.
Demus. What’s all this shouting? Go away, you
fellows.
You’ve smashed my harvest-garland all to bits!
Who wrongs you, Paphlagon?

Paphlagon. He, and these young men,
Keep beating me because of you.

Demus. Why so?

Paphlagon. Because I love you and adore you, Demus.

Demus. (To Sausage-Seller) And who are you?

S.-S. A rival for your love.
Long have I loved, and sought to do you good,
With many another honest gentleman,
But Paphlagon won’t let us. You yourself,
Excuse me sir, are like the boys with lovers.
The honest gentlemen you won’t accept,
Yet give yourself to lantern-selling chaps,
To sinew-stitchers, cobblers, aye and tanners.

Paphlagon. Because I am good to Demus.

S.-S. Tell me how.

Paphlagon. ’Twas I slipped in before the general there
And sailed to Pylus, and brought back the Spartans.

ARISTOPHANES

744-778
S.-S. And I walked round, and from the workshop
stole
A mess of pottage, cooked by someone else.

Paphlagon. Come, make a full Assembly out of hand,
O Demus, do; then find which loves you best,
And so decide, and give that man your love.

S.-S. O Demus, do. Not in the Pnyx however.

Demus. Aye, in the Pnyx, not elsewhere will I sit.
So forward all, move forward to the Pnyx.

S.-S. O luckless me, I’m ruined! The old fellow
Is, when at home, the brightest man alive;
But once he sits upon his rock, he moons
With open mouth, as one who gapes for figs.

*Demus now takes his seat as the audience in the mimic Pnyx, and the orators take their places*.

Chorus. Now loosen every hawser,
now speed your bark along,
And mind your soul is eager,
and mind your words are strong,
No subterfuge admitting;
the man has many a trick
From hopeless things, in hopeless times,
a hopeful course to pick.
Upon him with a whirlwind’s force,
impetuous, fresh and quick.
But keep on his movements a watch; and be sure
that before he can deal you a blow,
You hoist to the mast your dolphins, and cast
your vessel alongside the foe.

Paphlagon. To the Lady who over the city presides,
to our mistress Athena, I pray
If beyond all the rest I am stoutest and best,
in the service of Demus to-day,
Except *Salabaccho*, and *Cynna* the bold,
and *Lysicles*—then in the Hall
May I dine as of late at the cost of the State
for doing just nothing at all.
But O if I hate you, nor stride to the van
to protect you from woes and mishaps,
Then slay me, and flay me, and saw me to bits,
to be cut into martingale straps.

S.-S. And I, if I love you not, Demus, am game
to be slaughtered by chopping and mincing,
And boiled in a sausage-meat pie; and if that
is, you think, not entirely convincing,
Let me here, if you please, with a morsel of cheese,
upon this to a salad be grated,
Or to far Cerameicus be dragged through the streets
with my flesh-hook, and there be cremated.

Paphlagon. O Demus, how can there be ever a man
who loves you as dearly as I?
When on me you relied your finances to guide,
your Treasury never was dry,
I was begging of these, whilst those I would squeeze
and rack to extort what was due,
And nought did I care how a townsman might fare,
so long as I satisfied you.

S.-S. Why, Demus, there’s nothing to boast of
in that;
to do it I’m perfectly able.
I’ve only to steal from my comrade a meal,
and serve it up hot on your table.

479

779-806
And as for his loving and wishing you well,
it isn’t for you that he cares,
Excepting indeed for the gain that he gets,
and the snug little fire that he shares.
Why you, who at Marathon fought with the Medes,
for Athens and Hellas contending,
And won the great battle, and left us a theme
for our songs and our speeches unending,
He cares not a bit that so roughly you sit
on the rocks, nor has dreamed of providing
Those seats with the thing I have stitched you and
bring.
Just lift yourself up and subside in
This ease-giving cushion for fear you should gall
what at Salamis sat by the oar.

Demus. Who are you? I opine you are sprung from
the line
of Harmodius famous of yore;
So noble and Demus-relieving an act
I never have witnessed before!

Paphlagon. O me, by what paltry attentions and gifts
you contrive to attract and delude him!

S.-S. ’Twas by baits that are smaller and poorer
than mine,
you rascal, you hooked and subdued him.

Paphlagon. Was there ever a man since the City began
who for Demus has done such a lot,
Or fought for his welfare so stoutly as I?
I will wager my head there is not.

S.-S. You love him right well who permit him to
dwell
eight years in the clefts of the City,
In the nests of the vulture, in turrets and casks,
nor ever assist him or pity,
But keep him in durance to rifle his hive;
and that is the reason, no doubt,
Why the peace which, unsought, Archeptolemus
brought,
you were quick from the city to scout
And as for the embassies coming to treat,
you spanked them and chivied them out.

Paphlagon. That over all Hellas our Demus may rule;
for do not the oracles say,
He will surely his verdicts in Arcady give,
receiving five obols a day,
If he grow not aweary of fighting? Meanwhile,
it is I who will nourish and pet him,
And always the daily triobol he earns,
unjustly or justly I’ll get him.

S.-S. No not that o’er Arcady Demus may rule,
but rather that you might essay
To harry and plunder the cities at will,
while Demus is looking away,
And the war with the haze and the dust that you
raise
is obscuring your actions from view,
And Demus, constrained by his wants and his pay,
is a gaping dependent on you.
But if once to the country in peace he returns,
away from all fighting and fusses,
And strengthens his system with furmety there,
and a confect of olive discusses,

THE KNIGHTS

807-838
He will know to your cost what a deal he has lost,
while the pay you allowed him he drew,
And then, like a hunter, irate he will come
on the trail of a vote against you.
You know it; and Demus you swindle with dreams,
crammed full of yourself and your praises.

Paphlagon. It is really distressing to hear you presume
to arraign with such scurrilous phrases
Before the Athenians and Demus a man
who more for the city has done
Than e’er by Demeter Themistocles did
who glory undying has won.

S.-S. O city of Argos! yourself would you match
with mighty Themistocles, him
Who made of our city a bumper indeed,
though he found her scarce filled to the brim,
Who, while she was lunching, Peiraeus threw in,
as a dainty additional dish,
Who secured her the old, while providing untold
and novel assortments of fish;
Whilst you, with your walls of partition forsooth,
and the oracle-chants which you hatch,
Would dwarf and belittle the city again,
who yourself with Themistocles match!
And he was an exile, but you upon crumbs
Achillean your fingers are cleaning.

Paphlagon. Now is it not monstrous that I must endure
accusations so coarse and unmeaning,
And all for the love that I bear you?

Demus. Forbear! no more of your wrangle and row!
Too long have your light-fingered tricks with my
bread
my notice escaped until now.

S.-S. He’s the vilest of miscreants, Demus, and
works
more mischief than any, I vow.
While you’re gaping about, he is picking from out
Of the juiciest audit the juiciest sprout,
And devours it with zest; while deep in the chest
Of the public exchequer both hands are addressed
To ladling out cash for himself, I protest.

Paphlagon. All this you’ll deplore when it comes to the
fore
That of drachmas you stole thirty thousand or
more.

S.-S. Why make such a dash with your oar-blades,
and thrash
The waves into foam with your impotent splash?
’Tis but fury and sound; and you’ll shortly be
found
The worst of the toadies who Demus surround.
And proof I will give, or I ask not to live,
That a bribe by the Mitylenaeans was sent,
Forty minas and more; to your pockets it went.

Chorus. O sent to all the nation
a blessing and a boon!
O wondrous flow of language!
Fight thus, and you’ll be soon
The greatest man in Hellas,
and all the State command,
And rule our faithful true allies,
a trident in your hand,

ARISTOPHANES

839-870
Wherewith you’ll gather stores of wealth,
by shaking all the land.
And if he lend you once a hold,
then never let him go;
With ribs like these you ought with ease
to subjugate the foe.

Paphlagon. O matters have not come to that,
my very worthy friends!
I’ve done a deed, a noble deed,
a deed which so transcends
All other deeds, that all my foes
of speech are quite bereft,
While any shred of any shield,
from Pylus brought, is left.

S.-S. Halt at those Pylian shields of yours!
a lovely hold you’re lending.
For if you really Demus love,
what meant you by suspending
Those shields with all their handles on,
for action ready strapped?
O Demus, there’s a dark design
within those handles wrapped,
And if to punish him you seek,
those shields will bar the way.
You see the throng of tanner-lads
he always keeps in pay,
And round them dwell the folk who sell
their honey and their cheeses;
And these are all combined in one,
to do whate’er he pleases.
And if the oyster-shelling game
you seem inclined to play,
They’ll come by night with all their might
and snatch those shields away,
And then with ease will run and seize
the passes of—your wheat.

Demus. Oh, are the handles really there?
You rascal, what deceit
Have you so long been practising
that Demus you may cheat?

Paphlagon. Pray don’t be every speaker’s gull,
nor dream you’ll ever get
A better friend than I, who all
conspiracies upset.
Alone I crushed them all, and now,
if any plots are brewing
Within the town, I scent them down,
and raise a grand hallooing.

S.-S. O ay, you’re like the fisher-folk,
the men who hunt for eels,
Who when the mere is still and clear
catch nothing for their creels,
But when they rout the mud about
and stir it up and down,
’Tis then they do; and so do you,
when you perturb the town.
But answer me this single thing:
you sell a lot of leather,
You say you’re passionately fond
of Demus—tell me whether
You’ve given a clout to patch his shoes.

Demus. No never, I declare.

871-900
S.-S. You see the sort of man he is!
but I, I’ve bought a pair
Of good stout shoes, and here they are,
I give them you to wear.

Demus. O worthy, patriotic gift!
I really don’t suppose
There ever lived a man so kind
to Demus and his toes.

Paphlagon. ’Tis shameful that a pair of shoes
should have the power and might
To put the favours I’ve conferred
entirely out of sight,
I who struck *Gryttus* from the lists,
and stopped the boy-loves quite.

S.-S. ’Tis shameful, I with truth retort,
that you should love to pry
Into such vile degrading crimes
as that you name. And why?
Because you fear ’twill make the boys
for public speaking fit.
But Demus, at his age, you see
without a tunic sit,
In winter too; and nought from you
his poverty relieves,
But here’s a tunic I have brought,
well-lined, with double sleeves.

Demus. O, why Themistocles himself
ne’er thought of such a vest!
Peiraeus was a clever thing,
but yet, I do protest,
That on the whole, between the two,
I like the tunic best.

Paphlagon. (to Sausage-Seller) Pah! would you circum¬
vent me thus,
with such an apish jest?

S.-S. Nay as one guest, at supper-time,
will take another’s shoes,
When dire occasion calls him out,
so I your methods use.

Paphlagon. Fawn on: you won’t outdo me there.
I’ll wrap him round about
With this of mine. Now go and whine, you rascal.

Demus. Pheugh! get out!
(to Paphlagon’s wrapper) Go to the crows, you
brute, with that
disgusting smell of leather.

S.-S. He did it for the purpose, Sir;
to choke you altogether.
He tried to do it once before:
don’t you remember when
A stalk of silphium sold so cheap?

Demus. Remember? yes: what then?

S.-S. Why that was his contrivance too:
he managed there should be a
Supply for all to buy and eat;
and in the *Heliaea*
The dicasts one and all were seized
with violent diarrhoea.

Demus. O ay, a Coprolitic man
described the sad affair.

S.-S. And worse and worse and worse you grew,
till yellow-tailed you were.

901-948
Demus. It must have been Pyrrhander’s trick,
the fool with yellow hair.

Paphlagon. (to Sausage-Seller) With what tomfooleries,
you rogue, you harass and torment me.

S.-S. Yes, ’tis with humbug I’m to win;
for that the Goddess sent me.

Paphlagon. You shall not win! O Demus dear,
be idle all the day,
And I’ll provide you free, to swill,
a foaming bowl of—pay.

S.-S. And I’ll this gallipot provide,
and healing cream within it;
Whereby the sores upon your shins
you’ll doctor in a minute.

Paphlagon. I’ll pick these grey hairs neatly out,
and make you young and fair.

S.-S. See here; this hare-scut take to wipe
your darling eyes with care.

Paphlagon. Vouchsafe to blow your nose, and clean
your fingers on my hair.

S.-S. No, no; on mine, on mine, on mine!

Paphlagon. A trierarch's office you shall fill,
And by my influence I’ll prevail
That you shall get, to test your skill,
A battered hull with tattered sail.
Your outlay and your building too
On such a ship will never end;
No end of work you’ll have to do,
No end of cash you’ll have to spend.

Chorus. O see how foamy-full he gets.
Good Heavens, he’s boiling over; stay!
Some sticks beneath him draw away,
Bale out a ladleful of threats.

Paphlagon. Rare punishment for this you’ll taste;
I’ll make the taxes weigh you down;
Amongst the wealthiest of the town
I’ll manage that your name is placed.

S.-S. I will not use a single threat;
I only most devoutly wish
That on your brazier may be set
A hissing pan of cuttlefish;
And you the Assembly must address
About Miletus,—’tis a job
Which, if it meets entire success,
Will put a talent in your fob—
And O that ere your feast begin,
“The Assembly waits,” your friend may cry,
And you, afire the fee to win
And very loth to lose the fry,
May strive in greedy haste to swallow
The cuttles and be choked thereby.

Chorus. Good! Good! by Zeus, Demeter, and
Apollo.[^1]

Demus. Aye, and in all respects he seems to me
A worthy citizen. When lived a man
So good to the Many (the Many for a penny)?
You, Paphlagon, pretending that you loved me,
Primed me with garlic. Give me back my ring;
You shall no more be steward.

[^1]: This line is in prose; it is the solemn formula used in the *heliastic oath*.

# The Knights
by Aristophanes

### 948-996

Pa. Take the ring;
And be you sure, if I’m no more your guardian,
You’ll get, instead, a greater rogue than I.
Dem. Bless me, this can’t be mine, this signet-ring.
It’s not the same device, it seems to me;
Or can’t I see?
S.-S. What’s the device on yours?
Dem. A leaf of beef-fat stuffing, roasted well.
S.-S. No, that’s not here.
Dem. What then?
S.-S. A cormorant
With open mouth haranguing on a rock.
Dem. Pheugh!
S.-S. What’s the matter?
Dem. Throw the thing away.
He’s got Cleonymus’s ring, not mine.
Take this from me, and you be steward now.
Pa. O not yet, master, I beseech, not yet;
Wait till you’ve heard my oracles, I pray.
S.-S. And mine as well.
Pa. And if to his you listen,
You’ll be a liquor-skin.
S.-S. And if to his,
You’ll find yourself severely circumcised.
Pa. Nay, mine foretell that over all the land
Thyself shalt rule, with roses garlanded.
S.-S. And mine that crowned, in spangled purple robe,
Thou in thy golden chariot shalt pursue
And sue the lady *Smicythe* and her lord.
Pa. Well, go and fetch them hither, so that he
May hear them.
S.-S. Certainly; and you fetch yours.
Pa. Here goes. *Exit to house of Demus*.
S.-S. Here goes, by Zeus. There’s nought to
stop us. *Exit*.

**Chorus**
O bright and joyous day,
O day most sweet to all
Both near and far away,
The day of Cleon’s fall.
Yet in our Action-mart
I overheard by chance
Some ancient sires and tart
This counter-plea advance,
That but for him the State
Two things had ne’er possessed:
A stirrer-up of hate,
A pestle of unrest.
His swine-bred music we
With wondering hearts admire;
At school, his mates agree,
He always tuned his lyre
In Dorian style to play.
His master wrathful grew;
He sent the boy away,
And this conclusion drew,
“This boy from all his friends
Donations seeks to wile,
His art begins and ends
In Dono-do-rian style.”

### 997-1037

Pa. (*Re-entering*) Look at them, see! and there
are more behind.
S.-S. (*Re-entering*) O what a weight! and there
are more behind.
Dem. What are they?
Pa. Oracles!
Dem. All?
Pa. You seem surprised;
By Zeus, I’ve got a chestful more at home.
S.-S. And I a garret and two cellars full.
Dem. Come, let me see. Whose oracles are these?
Pa. Mine are by Bakis.
Dem. (To Sausage-seller) And by whom are yours?
S.-S. Mine are by Glanis, Bakis’ elder brother.
Dem. What do they treat of?
Pa. Mine? Of Athens, Pylus,
Of you, of me, of every blessed thing.
Dem. (To Sausage-seller) And you; of what
treat yours?
S.-S. Of Athens, pottage,
Of Lacedaemon, mackerel freshly caught,
Of swindling barley-measurers in the mart,
Of you, of me. That nincompoop be hanged.
Dem. Well, read them out; and prithee don’t forget
The one I love to hear about myself,
That I’m to soar, an Eagle, in the clouds.
Pa. Now then give ear, and hearken to my words:
“Heed thou well, *Erechtheides*,
the oracle’s drift, which Apollo
Out of his secret shrine
through priceless tripods delivered.
Keep thou safely the dog,
thy jag-toothed holy protector.
Yapping before thy feet,
and terribly roaring to guard thee,
He thy pay will provide: if he fail to provide it, he’ll perish;
Yea, for many the daws
that are hating and cawing against him.”
Dem. This, by Demeter, beats me altogether.
What does *Erechtheus* want with daws and dog?
Pa. I am the dog: I bark aloud for you.
And Phoebus bids you guard the dog; that’s me.
S.-S. It says not that; but this confounded dog
Has gnawn the oracle, as he gnaws the door.
I’ve the right reading here about the dog.
Dem. Let’s hear; but first I’ll pick me up a stone
Lest this dog-oracle take to gnawing me.
S.-S. “Heed thou well, *Erechtheides*,
the kidnapping Cerberus ban-dog;
Wagging his tail he stands,
and fawning upon thee at dinner,
Waiting thy slice to devour
when aught distract thine attention.
Soon as the night comes round
he steals unseen to the kitchen
Dog-wise; then will his tongue
clean out the plates and the—islands.”
Dem. Aye, by Poseidon, Glanis, that’s far better.

### 1038-1078

Pa. Nay, listen first, my friend, and then decide:
“Woman she is, but a lion
she’ll bear us in Athens the holy;
One who for Demus will fight
with an army of stinging mosquitoes,
Fight, as if shielding his whelps;
whom see thou guard with devotion
Building a wooden wall
and an iron fort to secure him.”
Do you understand?
Dem. By Apollo, no, not I.
Pa. The God, ’tis plain, would have you keep me
safely,
For I’m a valiant lion, for your sake.
Dem. What, you *Antileon* and I never knew it!
S.-S. One thing he purposely informs you not,
What that oracular wall of wood and iron,
Where Loxias bids you keep him safely, is.
Dem. What means the God?
S.-S. He means that you’re to clap
Paphlagon in the five-holed pillory-stocks.
Dem. I shouldn’t be surprised if that came true.
Pa. Heed not the words; for jealous
the crows that are croaking against me.
Cherish the lordly falcon,
nor ever forget that he brought thee,
Brought thee in fetters and chains
the young Laconian minnows.
S.-S. This did Paphlagon dare
in a moment of drunken bravado.
Why think much of the deed,
*Cecropides* foolish in counsel?
Weight a Woman will bear,
if a Man impose it upon her,
Fight she won’t and she can’t:
in fighting she’s always a fright in.
Pa. Nay, but remember the word,
“How Pylus,” he said, “before Pylus”;
Pylus there is before Pylus.
Dem. What mean you by that “before Pylus”?
S.-S. Truly your pile of baths
will he capture before you can take them.
Dem. O dear, then bathless must I go to-day!
S.-S. Because he has carried off our pile of baths.
But here’s an oracle about the fleet;
Your best attention is required to this.
Dem. I’ll give it too; but prithee, first of all,
Read how my sailors are to get their pay.
S.-S. “O *Aegeides*, beware
of the hound-fox, lest he deceive thee,
Stealthily snapping, the crafty,
the swift, the tricky marauder.”
Know you the meaning of this?
Dem. *Philostratus*, plainly, the hound-fox.
S.-S. Not so; but Paphlagon is evermore
Asking swift triremes to collect the silver,
So Loxias bids you not to give him these.
Dem. Why is a trireme called a hound-fox?
S.-S. Why?
A trireme’s fleet; a hound is also fleet.
Dem. But for what reason adds he “fox” to “hound”?
S.-S. The troops, he means, resemble little foxes,
Because they scour the farms and eat the grapes.
Dem. Good.
But where’s the cash to pay these little foxes?

### 1079-1120

S.-S. That I’ll provide: within three days I’ll do it.
List thou further the rede
by the son of Leto delivered;
“Keep thou aloof,” said he,
“from the wiles of hollow *Cyllene*.”
Dem. Hollow *Cyllene*! what’s that?
S.-S. ’Tis Paphlagon’s hand he’s describing.
Paphlagon’s outstretched hand,
with his “Drop me a coin in the hollow.”
Pa. There this fellow is wrong.
When he spake of the hollow *Cyllene*,
Phoebus was hinting, I ween,
at the hand of the maimed *Diopeithes*.
Nay, but I’ve got me, for you,
a winged oracular message,
“Thou shalt an Eagle become,
and rule all lands as a Monarch.”
S.-S. Nay, but I’ve got me the same:
“and the Red Sea too thou shalt govern,
Yea in *Ecbatana* judge,
rich cakes as thou judgest devouring.”
Pa. Nay, but I dreamed me a dream,
and methought the Goddess Athene
Health and wealth was ladling
in plentiful streams upon Demus.
S.-S. Nay, but I dreamed one myself;
and methought of the Goddess Athene
Down from the Citadel stepped,
and an owl sat perched on her shoulder;
Then from a bucket she poured
ambrosia down upon Demus,
Sweetest of scents upon you,
upon Paphlagon sourest of pickles.
Dem. Good! Good!
There never was a cleverer chap than Glanis.
So now, my friend, I yield myself to you;
Be you the tutor of my thoughtless—Age.
Pa. Not yet! Pray wait awhile, and I’ll provide
Your barley-grain, and daily sustenance.
Dem. I can’t abide your barley-talk; too often
Have I been duped by you and *Thuphanes*.
Pa. I’ll give you barley-meal, all ready-made.
S.-S. I’ll give you barley-cakes, all ready-baked,
And well-broiled fish. Do nothing else but eat.
Dem. Make haste and do it then, remembering this,
Whichever brings me most titbits to-day,
To him alone I’ll give the Pnyx’s reins.
Pa. O then I’ll run in first. *Exit*.
S.-S. Not you, but I. *Exit*.

**Chorus**
Ch. Proud, O Demus, thy sway.
Thee, as Tyrant and King,
All men fear and obey,
Yet, O yet, ’tis a thing
Easy, to lead thee astray.
Empty fawning and praise
Pleased thou art to receive;
All each orator says
Sure at once to believe;
Wit thou hast, but ’tis roaming;
Ne’er we find it its home in.

### 1121-1160

Dem. Wit there’s none in your hair.
What, you think me a fool!
What, you know not I wear,
Wear my motley by rule!
Well all day do I fare,
Nursed and cockered by all;
Pleased to fatten and train
One prime thief in my stall.
When full gorged with his gain,
Up that instant I snatch him,
Strike one blow and dispatch him.
Ch. Art thou really so deep?
Is such artfulness thine?
Well for all if thou keep
Firm to this thy design.
Well for all if, as sheep
Marked for victims, thou feed
These thy knaves in the Pnyx,
Then, if dainties thou need,
Haste on a victim to fix;
Slay the fattest and finest;
There’s thy meal when thou dinest.
Dem. Ah! they know not that I
Watch them plunder and thieve.
Ah! “’tis easy,” they cry,
“Him to gull and deceive.”
Comes my turn by and by!
Down their gullet, full quick,
Lo, my verdict-tube coils,
Turns them giddy and sick,
Up they vomit their spoils:
Such, with rogues, is my dealing,
’Tis for myself they are stealing.
*Enter Paphlagon and Sausage-seller*.
Pa. Go and be blest!
S.-S. Be blest yourself, you filth.
Pa. O Demus, I’ve been sitting here prepared
Three ages past, longing to do you good.
S.-S. And I ten ages, aye, twelve ages, aye,
A thousand ages, ages, ages, ages.
Dem. And I’ve been waiting, till I loathe you both,
For thirty thousand ages, ages, ages.
S.-S. Do—know you what?
Dem. And if I don’t, you’ll tell me.
S.-S. Do start us from the signal-post, us two,
All fair, no favour.
Dem. Right you are; move off.
Pa. and S.-S. Ready!
Dem. Away!
S.-S. No “cutting in” allowed.
Dem. Zeus! if I don’t, with these two lovers, have
A rare good time, ’tis dainty I must be.
Pa. See, I’m the first to bring you out a chair.
S.-S. But not a table; I’m the firstlier there.
Pa. Look, here’s a jolly little cake I bring,
Cooked from the barley-grain I brought from Pylus.
S.-S. And here I’m bringing splendid scoops of
bread,
Scooped by the Goddess with her ivory hand.

### 1161-1216

Dem. A mighty finger you must have, dread lady!
Pa. And here’s pease-porridge, beautiful and
brown.
*Pallas Pylaemachus* it was that stirred it.
S.-S. O Demus, plain it is the Goddess guards you,
Holding above your head this—soup-tureen.
Dem. Why, think you Athens had survived, unless
She plainly o’er us held her soup-tureen?
Pa. This slice of fish the Army-frightener sends
you.
S.-S. This boiled broth-meat the Nobly-fathered
gives you,
And this good cut of tripe and guts and paunch.
Dem. And well done she, to recollect the *peplus*.
Pa. The Terror-crested bids you taste this cake
With roe of fish, that we may row the better.
S.-S. And now take these.
Dem. Whatever shall I do
With these insides?
S.-S. The Goddess sends you these
To serve as planks inside your ships of war.
Plainly she looks with favour on our fleet.
Here, drink this also, mingled three and two.
Dem. Zeus! but it’s sweet and bears the three
parts well.
S.-S. *Tritogeneia* ’twas that three’d and two’d it.
Pa. Accept from me this slice of luscious cake.
S.-S. And this whole luscious cake accept from me.
Pa. Ah, you’ve no hare to give him; that give I.
S.-S. O me, wherever can I get some hare?
Now for some mountebank device, my soul.
Pa. Yah, see you this, poor Witless?
S.-S. What care I?
For there they are! Yes, there they are coming!
Pa. Who?
S.-S. Envoys with bags of silver, all for me.
Pa. Where? Where?
S.-S. What’s that to you? Let be the strangers.
My darling Demus, take the hare I bring.
Pa. You thief, you’ve given what wasn’t yours to
give!
S.-S. Poseidon, yes; you did the same at Pylus.
Dem. Ha! Ha! what made you think of filching
that?
S.-S. The thought’s Athene’s, but the theft was
mine.
Dem. ’Twas I that ran the risk!
Pa. ’Twas I that cooked it!
Dem. Be off: the credit’s his that served it up.
Pa. Unhappy me! I’m over-impudenced.
S.-S. Why not give judgement, Demus, of us two
Which is the better towards your paunch and you?
Dem. Well, what’s the test will make the audience
think
I give my judgement cleverly and well?
S.-S. I’ll tell you what; steal softly up, and search
My hamper first, then Paphlagon’s, and note
What’s in them; then you’ll surely judge aright.
Dem. Well, what does yours contain?
S.-S. See here, it’s empty.
Dear Father mine, I served up all for you.
Dem. A Demus-loving hamper, sure enough.

### 1217-1264

S.-S. Now come along, and look at Paphlagon’s.
Hey! only see!
Dem. Why here’s a store of dainties!
Why, here’s a splendid cheesecake he put by!
And me he gave the tiniest slice, so big.
S.-S. And, Demus, that is what he always does;
Gives you the pettiest morsel of his gains,
And keeps by far the largest share himself.
Dem. O miscreant, did you steal and gull me so,
The while I crowned thy pow and gied thee gifties.
Pa. And if I stole ’twas for the public good.
Dem. Off with your crown this instant, and I’ll
place it
On him instead.
S.-S. Off with it, filth, this instant.
Pa. Not so; a Pythian oracle I’ve got
Describing him who only can defeat me.
S.-S. Describing me, without the slightest doubt.
Pa. Well then I’ll test and prove you, to discern
How far you tally with the God’s predictions.
And first I ask this question,—when a boy
Tell me the teacher to whose school you went.
S.-S. Hard knuckles drilled me in the singeing
pits.
Pa. How say you? Heavens, the oracle’s word
strikes home!
Well!
What at the trainer’s did you learn to do?
S.-S. Forswear my thefts, and stare the accuser
down.
Pa. Phoebus Apollo! *Lycius*! what means this?
Tell me what trade you practised when a man.
S.-S. I sold sausages—
Pa. Well?
S.-S. And sold myself.
Pa. Unhappy me! I’m done for. There remains
One slender hope whereon to anchor yet.
Where did you sell your sausages? Did you stand
Within the *Agora*, or beside the Gates?
S.-S. Beside the Gates, where the salt-fish is sold.
Pa. O me, the oracle has all come true!
Roll in, roll in, this most unhappy man.
O crown, farewell. Unwillingly I leave thee.
Begone, but thee some other will obtain,
A luckier man perchance, but not more—thievish.
S.-S. *Hellanian* Zeus, the victory-prize is thine!
Dem. Hail, mighty Victor, nor forget ’twas I
Made you a Man; and grant this small request,
Make me your *Phanus*, signer of your writs.
Dem. Your name, what is it?
S.-S. *Agoracritus*.
An *Agora*-life I lived, and thrived by wrangling.
Dem. To *Agoracritus* I commit myself,
And to his charge consign this Paphlagon.
S.-S. And, Demus, I will always tend you well,
And you shall own there never lived a man
Kinder than I to the Evergaping City.
*Exeunt all but Chorus to house of Demus*.

**Chorus**
Ch. O what is a nobler thing,
Beginning or ending a song,
For horsemen who joy in driving
Their fleet-foot coursers along,
Than—Never to launch a lampoon
at *Lysistratus*, scurvy buffoon;
Or at heartless *Thumantis* to gird,
poor starveling, in lightness of heart;
Who is weeping hot tears at thy shrine,
Apollo, in Pytho divine,
And, clutching thy quiver, implores
to be healed of his poverty’s smart!

### 1265-1302

For lampooning worthless wretches,
none should bear the bard a grudge;
’Tis a sound and wholesome practice,
if the case you rightly judge.
Now if he whose evil-doings
I must needs expose to blame
Were himself a noted person,
never had I named the name
Of a man I love and honour.
Is there one who knows not well
*Arignotus*, prince of harpers?
None, believe me, who can tell
How the whitest colour differs
from the stirring tune he plays.
*Arignotus* has a brother
(not a brother in his ways)
Named *Ariphrades*, a rascal—
nay, but that’s the fellow’s whim—
Not an ordinary rascal,
or I had not noticed him.
Not a thorough rascal merely;
he’s invented something more,
Novel forms of self-pollution,
bestial tricks unknown before.
Yea, to nameless filth and horrors
does the loathsome wretch descend,
Works the work of *Polymnestus*,
calls *Oenichus* his friend.
Whoso loathes not such a monster
never shall be a friend of mine,
Never from the selfsame goblet
quaff, with us, the rosy wine.
And oft in the watches of night
My spirit within me is thrilled,
To think of Cleonymus eating
As though he would never be filled.
O whence could the fellow acquire
that appetite deadly and dire?
They say when he grazes with those
whose table with plenty is stored
That they never can get him away
from the trencher, though humbly they pray,
“Have mercy, O King, and depart!
O spare, we beseech thee, the board!”
Recently, ’tis said, our galleys
met their prospects to discuss,
And an old experienced trireme
introduced the subject thus;
“Have ye heard the news, my sisters?
’tis the talk in every street,
That *Hyperbolus* the worthless,
vapid townsman, would a fleet
Of a hundred lovely galleys
lead to Carthage far away.”

### 1303-1330

Over every prow there mantled
deep resentment and dismay.
Up and spoke a little galley,
yet from man’s pollution free,
“Save us! such a scurvy fellow
never shall be lord of me.
Here I’d liefer rot and moulder,
and be eaten up of worms.”
“Nor *Nauphante*, *Nauson’s* daughter,
shall he board on any terms;
I, like you, can feel the insult;
I’m of pine and timber knit.
Wherefore, if the measure passes,
I propose we sail and sit
Suppliant at the shrine of Theseus,
or the Dread Avenging Powers.
He shall ne’er, as our commander,
fool it o’er this land of ours.
If he wants a little voyage,
let him launch his sale-trays, those
Whereupon he sold his lanterns,
steering to the kites and crows.”
*Enter Sausage-seller*.
S.-S. O let not a word of ill omen be heard;
away with all proof and citation,
And close for to-day the Law Courts, though they
are the joy and delight of our nation.
At the news which I bring let the theatre ring
with *Paeans* of loud acclamation.
Ch. O Light of the City, O Helper and friend
of the islands we guard with our fleets,
What news have you got? O tell me for what
shall the sacrifice blaze in our streets?
S.-S. Old Demus I’ve stewed till his youth is
renewed,
and his aspect most charming and nice is.
Ch. O where have you left him, and where is
he now,
you inventor of wondrous devices?
S.-S. He dwells in the City of ancient renown,
which the violet chaplet is wearing.
Ch. O would I could see him! O what is his garb,
and what his demeanour and bearing?
S.-S. As when, for his mess-mates, *Miltiades* bold
and just *Aristeides* he chose.
But now ye shall see him, for, listen, the bars
of the great *Propylaea* unclose.
Shout, shout to behold, as the portals unfold,
fair Athens in splendour excelling,
The wondrous, the ancient, the famous in song,
where the noble Demus is dwelling!
Ch. O shining old town of the violet crown,
O Athens the envied, display
The Sovereign of Hellas himself to our gaze,
the monarch of all we survey.
*Enter Demus*.

### 1331-1380

S.-S. See, see where he stands, no vote in his hands,
but the golden *cicala* his hair in,
All splendid and fragrant with peace and with
myrrh,
and the grand old apparel he’s wearing!
Ch. Hail, Sovereign of Hellas! with thee we rejoice,
right glad to behold thee again
Enjoying a fate that is worthy the State
and the trophy on Marathon’s plain.
Dem. O *Agoracritus*, my dearest friend,
What good your stewing did me!
S.-S. Say you so?
Why, if you knew the sort of man you were,
And what you did, you’d reckon me a god.
Dem. What was I like? What did I do? Inform
me.
S.-S. First, if a speaker in the Assembly said
“O Demus, I’m your lover, I alone
Care for you, scheme for you, tend and love you
well,”
I say if anyone began like that
You clapped your wings and tossed your horns.
Dem. What, I?
S.-S. Then in return he cheated you and left.
Dem. O did they treat me so, and I not know it!
S.-S. Because, by Zeus, your ears would open wide
And close again, like any parasol.
Dem. Had I so old and witless grown as that?
S.-S. And if, by Zeus, two orators proposed,
One to build ships of war, one to increase
Official salaries, the salary man
Would beat the ships-of-war man in a canter.
Hallo! why hang your head and shift your ground?
Dem. I am ashamed of all my former faults.
S.-S. You’re not to blame; pray don’t imagine
that.
’Twas they who tricked you so. But answer this;
If any scurvy advocate should say,
‘‘Now please remember, justices, ye’ll have
No barley, if the prisoner gets off free,”
How would you treat that scurvy advocate?
Dem. I’d tie *Hyperbolus* about his neck,
And hurl him down into the Deadman’s Pit.
S.-S. Why now you are speaking sensibly and well.
How else, in public business, will you act?
Dem. First, when the sailors from my ships of war
Come home, I’ll pay them all arrears in full.
S.-S. For that, full many a well-worn rump will
bless you.
Dem. Next, when a *hoplite’s* placed in any list,
There shall he stay, and not for love or money
Shall he be shifted to some other list.
S.-S. That bit the shield-strap of Cleonymus.
Dem. No beardless boy shall haunt the *agora*
now.
S.-S. That’s rough on *Straton* and on *Cleisthenes*.
Dem. I mean those striplings in the perfume-mart,
Who sit them down and chatter stuff like this,
‘‘Sharp fellow, *Phaeax*; wonderful defence;
Coercive speaker; most conclusive speaker;
Effective; argumentative; incisive;
Superlative against the combative.”

### 1381-1393

S.-S. You’re quite derisive of these talkatives.
Dem. I’ll make them all give up their politics,
And go a-hunting with their hounds instead.
S.-S. Then on these terms accept this folding-stool;
And here’s a boy to carry it behind you.
No eunuch he!
Dem. O, I shall be once more
A happy Demus as in days gone by.
S.-S. I think you’ll think so when you get the sweet
Thirty-year treaties. Treaties dear, come here.
Dem. Worshipful Zeus! how beautiful they are.
Wouldn’t I like to solemnize them all.
Whence got you these?
S.-S. Why, had not Paphlagon
Bottled them up that you might never see them?

### 1394-1408

Now then I freely give you them to take
Back to your farms, with you.
Dem. But Paphlagon
Who wrought all this, how will you punish him?
S.-S. Not much: this only: he shall ply my trade,
Sole sausage-seller at the City gates.
There let him dogs’-meat mix with asses’ flesh,
There let him, tipsy, with the harlots wrangle,
And drink the filthy scouring of the bath.
Dem. A happy thought; and very fit he is
To brawl with harlots and with bathmen there.
But you I ask to dinner in the Hall,
To take the place that scullion held before.
Put on this frog-green robe and follow me.
Whilst him they carry out to ply his trade,
That so the strangers, whom he wronged, may
see him.
