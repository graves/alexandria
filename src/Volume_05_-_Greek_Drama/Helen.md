*Setting: The Tomb of Proteus in the island of Pharos.*
*Enter HELEN.*

HELEN. Lo! these are the fair virgin streams of Nile, the river that waters *Egypt's* tilth, fed by pure melting snow instead of rain from heaven. *Proteus* during his lifetime was king of this land, dwelling in the isle of *Pharos*, and ruling o'er *Egypt*; and he took to wife one of the daughters of the sea, *Psamathe*, after she left the embraces of *Aeacus*. Two children she bare in this his palace, a son *Theoclymenus*, who hath passed his life in duteous service to the gods, and likewise a noble daughter, her mother's pride, called *Eido* in her infancy, but when she reached her youthful prime, the age for wedded joys, renamed *Theonoe*; for well she knew whate'er the gods design, both present and to come, for she had won this guerdon from her grandsire *Nereus*. Nor is my fatherland unknown to fame, e'en *Sparta*, or my sire *Tyndareus*; for a legend tells how *Zeus* winged his way to my mother *Leda's* breast, in the semblance of a bird, even a swan, and thus as he fled from an eagle's pursuit, achieved by guile his amorous purpose, if this tale be true. My name is Helen, and I will now recount the sorrows I have suffered. To a hollow vale on *Ida* came three goddesses to *Paris*, for beauty's prize contending, *Hera* and *Cypris*, and the virgin child of *Zeus*, eager to secure his verdict on their loveliness. Now *Cypris* held out my beauty—if aught so wretched deserves that name—as a bribe before the eyes of *Paris*, saying he should marry me; and so she won the day; wherefore the shepherd of *Ida* left his steading, and came to *Sparta*, thinking to win me for his bride. But *Hera*, indignant at not defeating the goddesses, brought to naught my marriage with *Paris*, and gave to *Priam's* princely son not Helen, but a phantom endowed with life, that she made in my image out of the breath of heaven; and *Paris* thought that I was his, although I never was—an idle fancy! Moreover, the counsels of *Zeus* added further troubles unto these; for upon the land of *Hellas* and the hapless *Phrygians* he brought a war, that he might lighten mother-earth of her myriad hosts of men, and to the bravest of the sons of *Hellas* bring renown. So I was set up as a prize for all the chivalry of *Hellas*, to test the might of *Phrygia*, yet not I, but my name alone; for *Hermes* caught me up in the embracing air, and veiled me in a cloud; for *Zeus* was not unmindful of me; and he set me down here in the house of *Proteus*, judging him to be the most virtuous of all mankind; that so I might preserve my marriage with *Menelaus* free from taint. Here then I abide, while my hapless lord has gathered an army, and is setting out for the towers of *Ilium* to track and recover me. And there by *Scamander's* streams hath many a life breathed out its last, and all for me; and I, that have endured all this, am accursed, and seem to have embroiled all *Hellas* in a mighty war by proving a traitress to my husband. Why, then, do I prolong my life? Because I heard *Hermes* declare, that I should yet again make my home on *Sparta's* glorious soil, with my lord—for *Hermes* knew I never went to *Ilium*—that so I might never submit to any other's wooing. Now as long as *Proteus* gazed upon yon glorious sun, I was safe from marriage; but when o'er him the dark grave closed, the dead man's son was eager for my hand. But I, from regard to my former husband, am throwing myself down in suppliant wise before this tomb of *Proteus*, praying him to guard my husband's honour, that, though through *Hellas* I bear a name dishonoured, at least my body here may not incur disgrace.

*Enter TEUCER.*

TEUCER. Who is lord and master of this fenced palace?
The house is one I may compare to the halls of *Plutus*,
With its royal bulwarks and towering buildings.
Ha! great gods! what sight is here?
I see the counterfeit of that fell murderous dame,
Who ruined me and all the *Achaeans*.
May Heaven show its loathing for thee,
So much dost thou resemble Helen!
Were I not standing on a foreign soil,
With this well-aimed shaft had I worked thy death,
Thy reward for resembling the daughter of *Zeus*.

HELEN. Oh! why, poor man, whoe'er thou art,
Dost thou turn from me, loathing me for those troubles Helen caused?

TEUCER. I was wrong; I yielded to my anger more than I ought;
My reason was, the hate all *Hellas* bears to that daughter of *Zeus*.
Pardon me, lady, for the words I uttered.

HELEN. Who art thou? Whence comest thou to visit this land?

TEUCER. One of those hapless *Achaeans* am I, lady.

HELEN. No wonder then that thou dost hate Helen.
But say, who art thou? Whence comest? By what name am I to call thee?

TEUCER. My name is *Teucer*; my sire was *Telamon*,
And *Salamis* is the land that nurtured me.

HELEN. Then why art thou visiting these meadows by the *Nile*?

TEUCER. A wanderer I, an exile from my native land.

HELEN. Thine must be a piteous lot;
Who from thy country drives thee out?

TEUCER. My father *Telamon*. Couldst find a nearer and a dearer?

HELEN. But why? This case is surely fraught with woe.

TEUCER. The death of *Aias* my brother at *Troy*, was my ruin.

HELEN. How so? Surely 'twas not thy sword that stole his life away?

TEUCER. He threw himself on his own blade and died.

HELEN. Was he mad? For who with sense endowed would bring himself to this?

TEUCER. Dost thou know aught of *Achilles*, son of *Peleus*?

HELEN. He came, so I have heard, to woo Helen once.

TEUCER. When he died, he left his arms for his comrades to contest.

HELEN. Well, if he did, what harm herein to *Aias*?

TEUCER. When another won these arms, to himself he put an end.

HELEN. Art thou then a sufferer by woes that he inflicted?

TEUCER. Yes, because I did not join him in his death.

HELEN. So thou camest, sir stranger, to *Ilium's* famous town?

TEUCER. Aye, and, after helping to sack it, myself did learn what ruin meant.

HELEN. Is *Troy* already fired and utterly by flames consumed?

TEUCER. Yea, so that not so much as one vestige of her walls is now to be seen.

HELEN. Woe is thee, poor Helen! Thou art the cause of *Phrygia's* ruin.

TEUCER. And of *Achaea's* too. Ah! 'tis a tale of grievous misery!

HELEN. How long is it since the city was sacked?

TEUCER. Nigh seven fruitful seasons have come and gone.

HELEN. And how much longer did ye abide in *Troy*?

TEUCER. Many a weary month, till through ten full years the moon had held her course.

HELEN. And did ye capture that *Spartan* dame?

TEUCER. *Menelaus* caught her by the hair, and was for dragging her away.

HELEN. Didst thou thyself behold that unhappy one? Or art thou speaking from hearsay?

TEUCER. As plain as I now see thee, I then saw her.

HELEN. Consider whether ye were but indulging an idle fancy sent by heaven.

TEUCER. Bethink thee of some other topic; no more of her!

HELEN. Are you so sure this fancy was reliable?

TEUCER. With these eyes I saw her face to face, if so be I see thee now.

HELEN. Hath *Menelaus* reached his home by this time with his wife?

TEUCER. No; he is neither in *Argos*, nor yet by the streams of *Eurotas*.

HELEN. Ah me! Here is evil news for those to whom thou art telling it.

TEUCER. 'Tis said he disappeared with his wife.

HELEN. Did not all the *Argives* make the passage together?

TEUCER. Yes; but a tempest scattered them in every direction.

HELEN. In what quarter of the broad ocean?

TEUCER. They were crossing the *Aegean* in mid channel.

HELEN. And after that, doth no man know of *Menelaus'* arrival?

TEUCER. No, none; but through *Hellas* is he reported to be dead.

HELEN. Then am I lost. Is the daughter of *Thestius* alive?

TEUCER. Dost speak of *Leda*? She is dead; aye, dead and gone.

HELEN. Was it Helen's shame that caused her death?

TEUCER. Aye, 'tis said she tied the noose about her noble neck.

HELEN. Are the sons of *Tyndareus* still alive or not?

TEUCER. Dead, and yet alive: 'tis a double story.

HELEN. Which is the more credible report? Woe is me for my sorrows!

TEUCER. Men say that they are gods in the likeness of stars.

HELEN. That is happy news; but what is the other rumour?

TEUCER. That they by self-inflicted wounds gave up the ghost because of their sister's shame. But enough of such talk! I have no wish to multiply my griefs. The reason of my coming to this royal palace was a wish to see that famous prophetess *Theonoe*. Do thou the means afford, that I from her may obtain an oracle how I shall steer a favourable course to the sea-girt shores of *Cyprus*; for there *Apollo* hath declared my home shall be, giving to it the name of *Salamis*, my island home, in honour of that fatherland across the main.

HELEN. That shall the voyage itself explain, sir stranger; but do thou leave these shores and fly, ere the son of *Proteus*, the ruler of this land, catch sight of thee. Now is he away with his trusty hounds tracking his savage quarry to the death; for every stranger that he catches from the land of *Hellas* doth he slay. His reason never ask to know; my lips are sealed; for what could word of mine avail thee?

TEUCER. Lady, thy words are fair. Heaven grant thee a fair requital for this kindness! For though in form thou dost resemble Helen, thy soul is not like hers, nay, very different. Perdition seize her! May she never reach the streams of *Eurotas*! But thine be joy for evermore, lady!
*Exit TEUCER.*

HELEN. Ah me! what piteous dirge shall I strive to utter,
Now that I am beginning my strain of bitter lamentation?
What *Muse* shall I approach with tears or songs of death or woe?
Ah me! ye *Sirens*, Earth's virgin daughters, winged maids,
Come, oh! come to aid my mourning,
Bringing with you the *Libyan* flute or pipe,
To waft to *Persephone's* ear a tearful plaint,
The echo of my sorrow, with grief for grief,
And mournful chant for chant, with songs of death and doom
To match my lamentation, that in return she may receive from me,
Besides my tears, dirges for the departed dead beneath her gloomy roof!

*Enter CHORUS.*

CHORUS. Beside the deep-blue water I chanced to be hanging
Purple robes along the tendrils green and on the sprouting reeds,
To dry them in the sun-god's golden blaze,
When lo! I heard a sound of woe, a mournful wail,
The voice of one crying aloud in her anguish;
Yea, such a cry of woe as *Naiad* nymph might send ringing o'er the hills,
While to her cry the depths of rocky grots re-echo her screams
At the violence of *Pan*.

HELEN. Woe! woe! ye maids of *Hellas*, booty of barbarian sailors!
One hath come, an *Achaean* mariner, bringing fresh tears to me,
The news of *Ilium's* overthrow, how that it is left
To the mercy of the foeman's flame, and all for me the murderess,
Or for my name with sorrow fraught.
While for anguish at my deed of shame, hath *Leda* sought her death by hanging;
And on the deep, to weary wandering doomed my lord hath met his end;
And *Castor* and his brother, twin glory of their native land,
Are vanished from men's sight, leaving the plains that shook
To their galloping steeds, and the course beside reed-fringed *Eurotas*,
Where those youthful athletes strove.

CHORUS. Ah, misery! Alas! for thy grievous destiny!
Woe for thy sad lot, lady! Ah! 'twas a day of sorrow
Meted out for thee when *Zeus* came glancing through the sky
On snowy pinions like a swan and won thy mother's heart.
What evil is not thine? Is there a grief in life that thou hast not endured?
Thy mother is dead; the two dear sons of *Zeus* have perished miserably,
And thou art severed from thy country's sight,
While through the towns of men a rumour runs,
Consigning thee, my honoured mistress, to a barbarian's bed;
And 'mid the ocean waves thy lord hath lost his life,
And never, never more shalt thou fill with glee thy father's halls
Or *Athena's* temple of the "Brazen House."

HELEN. Ah! who was that *Phrygian*, who was he,
That felled that pine with sorrow fraught for *Ilium*,
And for those that came from *Hellas*?
Hence it was that *Priam's* son his cursed barque did build,
And sped by barbarian oars sailed unto my home,
In quest of beauty, woman's curse, to win me for his bride;
And with him sailed the treacherous queen of Love, on slaughter bent,
With death alike for *Priam's* sons, and *Danai* too.
Ah me! for my hard lot! Next, *Hera*, stately bride of *Zeus*,
Seated on her golden throne, sent the son of *Maia*, swift of foot,
Who caught me up as I was gathering fresh rose-buds in the folds of my robe,
That I might go to the "Brazen House," and bore me through the air
To this loveless land, making me an object of unhappy strife
'Twixt *Hellas* and the race of *Priam*.
And my name is but a sound without reality beside the streams of *Simois*.

CHORUS. Well I know thou hast a bitter lot to bear;
Still 'tis best to bear as lightly as we may the ills that life is heir to.

HELEN. Good friends, to what a fate am I united? Did not my mother bear me to be a monster to the world? For no woman, *Hellene* or barbarian, gives birth to babes in eggs enclosed, as they say *Leda* bare me to *Zeus*. My life and all I do is one miracle, partly owing to *Hera*, and partly is my beauty to blame. Would God I could rub my beauty out like a picture, and assume hereafter in its stead a form less comely, and oh! that *Hellas* had forgotten the evil fate that now I bear, and were now remembering my career of honour as surely as they do my deeds of shame. Now, if a man doth turn his eyes to a single phase of fortune, and meets ill-usage at heaven's hands, 'tis hard no doubt; but still it can be borne; but I in countless troubles am involved. First, although I never sinned, my good name is gone. And this is a grief beyond the reality, if a man incurs blame for sins that are not his. Next, have the gods removed me from my native land, to dwell with men of barbarous habits, and reft of every friend, I am become a slave though free by birth; for amongst barbarians all are slaves but one. And the last anchor that held my fortunes, the hope that my husband would return one day, and rid me of my woes, is now no more, lost since the day he died. My mother too, is dead, and I am called her murderess, unjustly it is true, but still that injustice is mine to bear; and she that was the glory of my house, my darling child, is growing old and grey, unwedded still; and those twin brethren, called the sons of *Zeus*, are now no more. But 'tis fortune, not my own doing, that hath crushed me with sorrow and slain me. And this is the last evil of all; if ever I come to my native land, they will shut me up in prison, thinking me that Helen of *Ilium*, in quest of whom *Menelaus* came thither. Were my husband still alive, we might have recognized each other, by having recourse to tokens which ourselves alone would know. But now this may not be, nor is there any chance of his escape. Why then do I prolong my life? What fortune have I still in store? Shall I choose marriage as an alternative of evils, and dwell with a barbarian lord, seated at his sumptuous board? No! when a husband she loathes is mated with a woman, even life is loathly to her. Best for her to die; but how shall I die a noble death? The dangling noose is an uncomely end; even slaves consider it a disgrace; to stab oneself hath something fair and noble in it; 'tis a small thing that moment of ridding the flesh of life. Yes, it must be; I am plunged so deep in misery; for that beauty, which to other women is a boon, to me hath been a very bane.

CHORUS. Helen, never believe that the stranger, whoe'er he was that came, has spoken naught but truth.

HELEN. Yet he said so clearly that my lord was dead.

CHORUS. There is much that falsehood seems to make quite clear.

HELEN. The word of truth hath a very different sound to falsehood.

CHORUS. Thou art inclined to misfortune, rather than to luck.

HELEN. Fear girds me with terrors as with a garment, and takes me in her train.

CHORUS. What friends hast thou within the palace?

HELEN. All are my friends here save him who seeks to wed me.

CHORUS. Thy action then is clear; leave thy seat at the tomb.

HELEN. To what words or advice art thou leading up?

CHORUS. Go in and question the daughter of the ocean *Nereid*, who knoweth all things, even *Theonoe*, whether thy husband is still alive, or whether he hath left the light of day; and when thou knowest for certain, be glad or sorrowful, as fits thy fortune. But before thou hast any correct information, what shall sorrow avail thee? Nay, hearken to me; leave this tomb and seek the maiden's company, that she may tell thee the truth, for from her shalt thou learn all. If thou abide here in this building, what prospect hast thou? And I will myself go in with thee, and with thee inquire of the maiden's oracles; for 'tis a woman's bounden duty to share a sister's trouble.

HELEN. Kind friends, I welcome your advice. Come in, come in, that ye may learn the result of my struggle within the palace.

CHORUS. Thy invitation comes to very willing ears.

HELEN. Woe for this heavy day! Ah me! what mournful tidings shall I hear?

CHORUS. Dear mistress mine, be not a prophetess of sorrow, forestalling lamentation.

HELEN. What is the fate of my poor husband? Doth he still behold the light turning towards the sun-god's chariot and the stars in their courses?

CHORUS. ***

HELEN. ***
Or among the dead, beneath the earth, is he to death consigned?

CHORUS. Of the future take a brighter view, whatever shall betide.

HELEN. On thee I call, and thee adjure, *Eurotas* green with river-reeds,
To tell me if this rumour of my husband's death be true.

CHORUS. What boots this meaningless appeal?

HELEN. About my neck will I fasten the deadly noose from above,
Or drive the murderous knife with self-aimed thrust deep into my throat to sever it,
Striving to cut my flesh, a sacrifice to those goddesses three
And to that son of *Priam*, who in days gone by
Would wake the music of his pipe around his steading.

CHORUS. Oh may sorrow be averted otherwhither, and thou be blest!

HELEN. Woe is thee, unhappy *Troy*! Thou through deeds not done by thee art ruined,
And hast suffered direst woe; for the gift that *Cypris* gave to me,
Hath caused a sea of blood to flow, and many an eye to weep,
With grief on grief and tear on tear. All this hath *Ilium* suffered...
And mothers have lost their children; and virgin sisters of the slain
Have cut off their tresses by the swollen tide of *Phrygian Scamander*.
And the land of *Hellas* hath lifted her voice of woe and broken forth in wailing,
Smiting on her head, and making tender cheeks to stream with gore
Beneath the rending nail. Ah blest maid *Callisto*,
Who long ago in *Arcady* didst find favour with *Zeus*,
In the semblance of a beast four-footed, how much happier was thy lot
Than my mother's, for thou hast changed the burden of thy grief
And now with savage eye art weeping o'er thy shaggy monster-shape;
Aye, and hers was a happier lot, whom on a day *Artemis* drove from her choir,
Changed to a hind with horns of gold, the fair *Titanian* maid,
Daughter of *Merops*, because of her beauty;
But my fair form hath proved the curse of *Dardan Troy* and doomed *Achaea's* sons.

*Enter MENELAUS. HELEN and CHORUS exit.*

MENELAUS. Ah! *Pelops*, easy victor long ago o'er thy rival *Oenomaus* in the chariot-race on *Pisa's* plain, wouldst thou hadst ended thy career amongst the gods that day thou wert beguiled into making a banquet for them, or ever thou hadst begotten my father *Atreus*, to whom were born by *Aerope* his wife, *Agamemnon* and myself *Menelaus*, an illustrious pair; and herein I make no idle boast, for 'twas a mighty host, I trow, that I their leader carried o'er the sea to *Troy*, using no violence to make them follow me, but leading all the chivalry of *Hellas* by voluntary consent. And some of these must we number 'mid the slain, and some to their joy have 'scaped the sea, bearing to their homes again names long reckoned dead. But I, poor wretch, go wandering o'er grey Ocean's swell a weary space, long as that which saw me sack the towers of *Ilium*; and for all my longing to reach my country I am not counted worthy of this boon by heaven, but to *Libya's* desert cheerless roadsteads have I sailed, to each and all of them; and whensoe'er I draw me near my native land, the storm-wind drives me back again, and never yet have favouring breezes filled my sails, to let me reach my fatherland. And now a wretched, shipwrecked mariner, my friends all lost, am I cast up upon this shore; and my ship is shattered in a thousand pieces against the rocks; and its keel was wrested from its cunning fastenings; thereon did I with difficulty escape, most unexpectedly, and Helen also, for her had I rescued from *Troy* and had with me. But the name of this country and its people I know not; for I blushed to mingle with the crowd to question them, anxious for very shame to hide my misfortunes which reduce me to these sorry rags. For when a man of high degree meets with adversity, he feels the strangeness of his fallen state more keenly than a sufferer of long standing. Dire want is wasting me; for I have neither food, nor raiment to gird myself withal; behold the facts before you to judge from—I am clad in tatters cast up from the ship; while all the robes I once did wear, glorious attire and ornaments, hath the sea swallowed; and in a cavern's deep recesses have I hidden my wife, the cause of all my trouble, and have come hither, after straitly charging the survivors of my friends to watch her. Alone am I come, seeking for those there left some help, if haply I may find it after careful search. So when I saw this palace girt with towering walls and stately gates of some prosperous lord, I drew nigh; for I have hope to obtain somewhat for my sailors from this wealthy house, whereas from houses which have no store, the inmates for all their goodwill could furnish naught. Ho! there, who keeps the gate and will come forth to bear my tale of woe into the house?

*Enter PORTRESS.*

PORTRESS. Who stands before the door? Begone from the house!
Stand not at the court-yard gate, annoying my masters!
Otherwise shalt thou die, for thou art a *Hellene* born,
And with them have we no dealings.

MENELAUS. Mother, herein sayest thou rightly on all points.
'Tis well; I will obey; but moderate thy words.

PORTRESS. Away! stranger, my orders are to admit no *Hellene* to this palace.

MENELAUS. Ha! do not seek to push me hence, or thrust me away by violence.

PORTRESS. Thou dost not heed my words, and therefore hast thyself to blame.

MENELAUS. Carry my message to thy master in the palace.

PORTRESS. Some one would rue it, methinks, were I to take thy message.

MENELAUS. I come as a shipwrecked man and a stranger, whom heaven protects.

PORTRESS. Well, get thee to some other house than this.

MENELAUS. Nay, but I will pass into the house; so listen to me.

PORTRESS. Let me tell thee thou art unwelcome, and soon wilt be forcibly ejected.

MENELAUS. Ah me! where are now those famous troops of mine?

PORTRESS. Elsewhere maybe thou wert a mighty man; thou art not here.

MENELAUS. O fortune! I have not deserved such contumely.

PORTRESS. Why are thy eyes with tear-drops wet? Why so sad?

MENELAUS. 'Tis the contrast with my fortunes erst so blest.

PORTRESS. Hence! then, and give thy friends those tears.

MENELAUS. What land is this? Whose is the palace?

PORTRESS. *Proteus* lives here. It is the land of *Egypt*.

MENELAUS. *Egypt*? Woe is me! To think that hither I have sailed!

PORTRESS. Pray, what fault hast thou to find with the race of *Nile*?

MENELAUS. 'Twas no fault I found; my own disasters I lament.

PORTRESS. There be plenty in evil case; thou art not the only one.

MENELAUS. Is the king, of whom thou speakest, here within?

PORTRESS. There is his tomb; his son rules in his stead.

MENELAUS. And where may he be? Abroad, or in the house?

PORTRESS. He is not within. To *Hellas* is he a bitter foe.

MENELAUS. His reason, pray, for this enmity? The results whereof I have experienced.

PORTRESS. Beneath this roof dwells the daughter of *Zeus*, Helen.

MENELAUS. What mean'st thou? What is it thou hast said? Repeat, I pray, thy words.

PORTRESS. The daughter of *Tyndareus* is here, who erst in *Sparta* dwelt.

MENELAUS. Whence came she? What means this business?

PORTRESS. She came from *Lacedaemon* hither.

MENELAUS. When? Surely I have never been robbed of my wife from the cave!

PORTRESS. Before the *Achaeans* went to *Troy*, sir stranger. But get thee hence; for somewhat hath chanced within, whereat the whole palace is in an uproar. Thou comest most unseasonably; and if my master catch thee, death will be thy stranger's gift. This say I, because to *Hellas* I am well disposed, albeit I gave thee harsh answers for fear of my master.

*Exit PORTRESS.*

MENELAUS. What can I think or say? For after my previous troubles, this is a fresh piece of ill-luck I hear, if, indeed, after recovering my wife from *Troy* and bringing her hither, and putting her for safety in the cave, I am then to find another woman living here with the same name as my wife. She called her the begotten child of *Zeus*. Can there be a man that hath the name of *Zeus* by the banks of *Nile*? The *Zeus* of heaven is only one, at any rate. Where is there a *Sparta* in the world save where *Eurotas* glides between his reedy banks? The name of *Tyndareus* is the name of one alone. Is there any land of the same name as *Lacedaemon* or *Troy*? I know not what to say; for naturally there are many in the wide world that have the same names, cities and women too; there is nothing, then, to marvel at. Nor yet again will I fly from the alarm a servant raises; for there is none so cruel of heart as to refuse me food when once he hears my name. All have heard of *Ilium's* burning, and I, that set it ablaze, am famous now throughout the world, I, *Menelaus*... I therefore wait the master of this house. There are two issues I must watch; if he prove somewhat stern of heart, I will to my wreck and there conceal myself; but if he show any sign of pity, I will ask for help in this my present strait. This is the crowning woe in all my misery, to beg the means of life from other princes, prince though I be myself; still needs must I. Yea, this is no saying of mine, but a word of wisdom,

> Naught in might exceedeth dread necessity.

*Enter CHORUS.*

CHORUS. I have heard the voice of the maiden inspired.

Clear is the answer she hath vouchsafed within yon
palace, declaring that Menelaus is not yet dead and
buried, passed to the land of shades, where darkness
takes the place of light; but on the stormy main is
520-571
wearing out his life, nor yet hath reached the haven
of his country, a wanderer dragging out a piteous
existence, reft of every friend, setting foot in every
corner of the world, as he voyageth home from Troy.

*Enter Helen.*

He. Lo! once again I seek the shelter of this tomb,
with Theonoe’s sweet tidings in my ears; she that
knoweth all things of a truth; for she saith my lord
is yet alive and in the light of day, albeit he is roaming
to and fro after many a weary voyage, and hither
shall he come whenso he reach the limit of his toils,
no novice in the wanderer’s life. But one thing did
she leave unsaid. Is he to escape when he hath come?
And I refrained from asking that question clearly,
so glad was I when she told me he was safe. For she
said that he was somewhere nigh this shore, cast up
by shipwreck with a handful of friends. Ah! when
shall I see thee come? How welcome will thy advent
be! Ha! who is this? Am I being snared by some
trick of Proteus' impious son? Oh! let me, like a
courser at its speed, or a votary of Bacchus, approach
the tomb! for there is something wild about
this fellow’s looks, who is eager to o’ertake me.

Men. Ho there! thou that with fearful effort seekest
to reach the basement of the tomb and the pillars
of burnt sacrifice, stay thee. Wherefore art flying?
Ah! with what speechless amaze the sight of
thee affects me!

He. O friends! I am being ill-treated. This fellow
is keeping me from the tomb, and is eager to take
and give me to his master, whose wooing I was seeking
to avoid.

Men. No robber I, or minister of evil.

He. At any rate the garb wherein thou art clad,
is unsightly.

Men. Stay thy hasty flight; put fear aside.

He. I do so, now that I have reached this spot.

Men. Who art thou? whom do I behold in thee,
lady?

He. Nay, who art thou? The self-same reason
prompts us both.

Men. I never saw a closer resemblance.

He. Great God! Yea, for to recognize our friends
is of God.

Men. Art thou from Hellas, or a native of this
land?

He. From Hellas; but I would learn thy story too.

Men. Lady, in thee I see a wondrous likeness to
Helen.

He. And I in thee to Menelaus; I know not what
to say.

Men. Well, thou hast recognized aright a man of
many sorrows.

He. Hail! to thy wife’s arms restored at last!

Men. Wife indeed! Lay not a finger on my robe.

He. The wife that Tyndareus, my father, gave thee.

Men. O Hecate, giver of light, send thy visions
favourably!

He. In me thou beholdest no spectre of the night,
attendant on the queen of phantoms.

Men. Nor yet am I in my single person the husband
of two wives.
572-611
He. What other woman calls thee lord?

Men. The inmate of yonder cave, whom I from
Troy convey.

He. Thou hast none other wife but me.

Men. Can it be my mind is wandering, my sight
failing?

He. Dost not believe thou seest in me thy wife?

Men. Thy form resembles her, but the real truth
robs me of this belief.

He. Observe me well; what need hast thou of
clearer proof?

Men. Thou art like her; that will I never deny.

He. Who then shall teach thee, unless it be thine
own eyes?

Men. Herein is my dilemma; I have another wife.

He. To Troy I never went; that was a phantom.

Men. Pray, who fashions living bodies?

He. The air, whence thou hast a wife of heaven’s
workmanship.

Men. What god's handiwork? Strange is the tale
thou tellest.

He. Hera made it as a substitute, to keep me from
Paris.

Men. How then couldst thou have been here, and
in Troy, at the same time?

He. The name may be in many a place at once,
though not the body.

Men. Unhand me! the sorrows I brought with me
suffice.

He. What! wilt leave me, and take that phantom
bride away?

Men. For thy likeness unto Helen, fare thee well.

He. Ruined! in thee I found my lord only to lose
thee.

Men. The greatness of my troubles at Troy convinces
me; thou dost not.

He. Ah, woe is me! who was ever more unfortunate
than I? Those whom I love best are leaving
me, nor shall I ever reach Hellas, my own dear
native land.

*Messenger (Entering hurriedly)* At last I find thee,
Menelaus, after an anxious search, not till I have
wandered through the length and breadth of this
foreign strand; I am sent by thy comrades, whom
thou didst leave behind.

Men. What news? Surely you are not being spoiled
by the barbarians?

Mes. A miracle hath happened; my words are too
weak for the reality.

Men. Speak; for judging by this haste, thou hast
stirring news.

Mes. My message is: thy countless toils have all
been toiled in vain.

Men. That is an old tale of woe to mourn! Come,
thy news?

Mes. Thy wife hath disappeared, soaring away
into the embracing air; in heaven she now is hidden,
and as she left the hollowed cave where we were
guarding her, she hailed us thus, “Ye hapless Phrygians,
and all Achaea’s race! for me upon Scamander’s
strand by Hera’s arts ye died from day to day, in
the false belief that Helen was in the hands of Paris.
612-665
But I, since I have stayed my appointed time, and
kept the laws of fate, will now depart unto the sky
that gave me birth; but the unhappy daughter of
Tyndareus, through no fault of hers, hath borne an
evil name without reason.” *(Catching sight of Helen)*
Daughter of Leda, hail to thee, so thou art here
after all! I was just announcing thy departure to the
hidden starry realms, little knowing that thou couldst
fly at will. I will not a second time let thee flout us
thus, for thou didst cause thy lord and his comrades
trouble all for naught in Ilium.

Men. This is even what she said; her words are
proved true; O longed-for day, how hath it restored
thee to my arms!

He. O Menelaus, dearest husband, the time of
sorrow has been long, but joy is now ours at last.
Ah, friends, what joy for me to hold my husband in
a fond embrace after many a weary cycle of yon
blazing lamp of day!

Men. What joy for me to hold my wife! but with
all the questions I have to ask about the interval I
know not with which to begin now.

He. O rapture! the very hair upon my head starts
up for joy! my tears run down! Around thy neck I
fling my arms, dear husband, to hug my joy to me.

Men. O happy, happy sight! I have no fault to
find; my wife, the daughter of Zeus and Leda, is
mine again, she whom her brothers on their snow-
white steeds, whilst torches blazed, made my happy
bride, but gods removed her from my home. Now
is the deity guiding us to a new destiny, happier
than of yore.

He. Evil into good transformed hath brought us
twain together at last, dear husband; but late though
it be, God grant me joy of my good luck!

Men. God grant thee joy! I join thee in the selfsame
prayer; for of us twain one cannot suffer without
the other.

He. No more, my friends, I mourn the past; no
longer now I grieve. My own dear husband is restored
to me, whose coming from Troy I have waited
many a long year.

Men. I to thee, and thou to me. And after these
long, long years I have at last discovered the fraud
of the goddess. But these tears, in gladness shed, are
tears of thankfulness rather than of sorrow.

He. What can I say? What mortal heart could
e’er have had such hope? To my bosom I press thee,
little as I ever thought to.

Men. And I to mine press thee, who all men thought
hadst gone to Ida’s town and the hapless towers of
Ilium.

He. Ah me! ah me! that is a bitter subject to
begin on.

Men. Tell me, I adjure thee, how wert thou from
my home conveyed?

He. Alas! alas! ’tis a bitter tale thou askest to hear.

Men. Speak, for I must hear it; all that comes is
Heaven’s gift.

He. I loathe the story I am now to introduce.

Men. Tell it for all that. ’Tis sweet to hear of
trouble past.
666-714
He. I ne’er set forth to be the young barbarian’s
bride, with oars and wings of lawless love to speed
me on my way.

Men. What deity or fate tore thee from thy country,
then?

He. Ah, my lord! ’twas Hermes, the son of Zeus,
that brought and placed me by the banks of Nile.

Men. A miracle! Who sent thee thither? O monstrous
story!

He. I wept, and still my eyes are wet with tears.
’Twas the wife of Zeus that ruined me.

Men. Hera? Wherefore should she afflict us twain?

He. Woe is me for my awful fate! Woe for those
founts and baths where the goddesses made brighter
still that beauty, which evoked the fatal verdict!

Men. Why did Hera visit thee with evil regarding
this verdict?

He. To wrest the promise of Cypris—

Men. How now? Say on.

He. From Paris, to whom that goddess pledged
me.

Men. Woe for thee!

He. And so she brought me hither to Egypt to
my sorrow.

Men. Then she gave him a phantom in thy stead,
as thou tellest me?

He. And then began those woes of thine, ah
mother! woe is me!

Men. What meanest thou?

He. My mother is no more; my shameful marriage
made her fix the noose about her neck.

Men. Ah me! is our daughter Hermione yet alive?

He. Still unwed, and childless still, she mourns
my fatal marriage.

Men. O Paris, who didst utterly o’erthrow my
home, here was thy ruin too and theirs, those countless
mail-clad Danai.

He. From my country, city, and from thee heaven
cast me forth unhappy and accursed, because I left—and
yet not I—home and husband for a union of
foul shame.

Ch. If haply ye find happiness in the future, it
will suffice when to the past ye look.

Mes. Menelaus, grant me too a portion of that
joy which, though mine own eyes see, I scarcely
comprehend.

Men. Come then, old friend, and share with us
our talk.

Mes. Was it not then in her power to decide all
the trouble in Troy?

Men. It was not; I was tricked by the gods into
taking to my arms a misty phantom-form, to my
sorrow.

Mes. How so? Was it then for this we vainly toiled?

Men. ’Twas Hera’s handiwork, and the jealousy
of three goddesses.

Mes. Is this real woman, then, thy wife?

Men. This is she; trust my word for that.

Mes. Daughter, how changeful and inscrutable is
the nature of God! With some good end doth he
vary men’s fortune—now up, now down; one suffers;
another who ne’er knew suffering, is in his turn
714-771
to awful ruin brought, having no assurance in his
lot from day to day. Thou and thy husband have
had your share of trouble—thou in what the world
has said, he in battle’s heat. For all the striving that
he strove, he got him naught; while now, without
an effort made, every blessing fortune boasts is his.
And thou, in spite of all, hast brought no shame
upon thy aged sire, or those twin sons of Zeus, nor
art thou guilty of those rumoured crimes. Now again
do I recall thy wedding rites, remembering the blazing
torch I bore beside thee in a four-horsed chariot
at full gallop; while thou with this thy lord, a new-made
bride, wert driving forth from thy happy
home. A sorry servant he, whoso regardeth not his
master’s interest, sympathizing with his sorrows and
his joys. Slave though I was born, yet may I be
numbered amongst honest servants; for in heart,
though not in name, I am free. For this is better
far than in my single person to suffer these two evils,
to feel my heart corrupt, and as the slave of others
to be at my neighbour’s beck and call.

Men. Come, old friend, oft hast thou stood side
by side with me and taken thy full share of toil; so
now be partner in my happiness. Go, tell my comrades,
whom I left behind, the state of matters here,
as thou hast found them, and the issue of my fortunes;
and bid them wait upon the beach and abide
the result of the struggle, which I trow awaits me;
and if mayhap we find a way to take this lady from
the land by stealth, tell them to keep good watch
that we may share the luck and escape, if possible,
from the barbarian’s clutch.

Mes. It shall be done, O king. Now I see how
worthless are the seers’ tricks, how full of falsehood;
nor is there after all aught trustworthy in the blaze
of sacrifice or in the cry of feathered fowls; ’tis folly,
the very notion that birds can help mankind. Calchas
never by word or sign showed the host the
truth, when he saw his friends dying on behalf of a
phantom, nor yet did Helenus; but the city was
stormed in vain. Perhaps thou wilt say, ’twas not
heaven’s will that they should do so. Then why do
we employ these prophets? Better were it to sacrifice
to the gods, and crave a blessing, leaving prophecy
alone; for this was but devised as a bait to catch
a livelihood, and no man grows rich by divination
if he is idle. No! Sound judgment and discernment
are the best of seers. *Exit messenger.*

Ch. My views about seers coincide exactly with
this old man’s: whoso hath the gods upon his side
will have the best seer in his house.

He. Good! so far all is well. But how camest thou,
poor husband, safe from Troy? though ’tis no gain
to know, yet friends feel a longing to learn all that
their friends have suffered.

Men. That one short sentence of thine contains
a host of questions. Why should I tell thee of our
losses in the Aegean, or of the beacon Nauplius lighted
on Euboea? or of my visits to Crete and the cities of
Libya, or of the peaks of Perseus? For I should
never satisfy thee with the tale, and by telling
thee should add to my own pain, though I suffered
771-808
enough at the time; and so would my grief be
doubled.

He. Thy answer shows more wisdom than my
question. Omit the rest, and tell me only this; how
long wert thou a weary wanderer o’er the wide sea’s
face?

Men. Seven long years did I see come and go,
besides those ten in Troy.

He. Alas, poor sufferer! ’twas a weary while. And
thou hast thence escaped only to bleed here.

Men. How so? what wilt thou tell? Ah wife, thou
hast ruined me.

He. Thou wilt be slain by him whose house this is.

Men. What have I done to merit such a fate?

He. Thou hast arrived unexpectedly to thwart
my marriage.

Men. What! is some man bent on wedding my
wife?

He. Aye, and on heaping those insults on me,
which I have hitherto endured.

Men. Is he some private potentate, or a ruler of
this land?

He. The son of Proteus, king of the country.

Men. This was that dark saying I heard the servant
tell.

He. At which of the barbarian’s gates wert thou
standing?

Men. Here, whence like a beggar I was like to be
driven.

He. Surely thou wert not begging victuals? Ah,
woe is me!

Men. That was what I was doing, though I had
not the name of beggar.

He. Of course thou knowest, then, all about my
marriage.

Men. I do. But whether thou hast escaped thy
lover, I know not.

He. Be well assured I have kept my body chaste.

Men. How wilt thou convince me of this? If true,
thy words are sweet.

He. Dost see the wretched station I have kept at
this tomb?

Men. I see, alas! a bed of straw; but what hast
thou to do with it?

He. There I crave escape from this marriage as a
suppliant.

Men. For want of an altar, or because it is the
barbarians’ way?

He. This was as good a protection to me as the
gods’ temples.

Men. May I not then even bear thee homeward
on my ship?

He. The sword far sooner than thy wife’s embrace
is waiting thee.

Men. So should I be of all men the most miserable.

He. Put shame aside, and fly from this land.

Men. Leaving thee behind? ’Twas for thy sake I
sacked Troy.

He. Better so, than that our union should cause
thy death.

Men. Oh! these are coward words, unworthy of
those days at Troy!
809-845
He. Thou canst not slay the prince, thy possible
intention.

Men. Hath he, then, a body which steel cannot
wound?

He. Thou shalt hear. But to attempt impossibilities
is no mark of wisdom.

Men. Am I to let them bind my hands, and say
nothing?

He. Thou art in a dilemma; some scheme must be
devised.

Men. I had liefer die in action than sitting still.

He. There is one hope, and only one, of our safety.

Men. Will gold, or daring deeds, or winning words
procure it?

He. We are safe if the prince learn not of thy coming.

Men. Will any one tell him it is I? He certainly
will not know who I am.

He. He hath within his palace an ally equal to the
gods.

Men. Some voice divine within the secret chambers
of his house?

He. No; his sister; Theonoe men call her.

Men. Her name hath a prophetic sound; tell me
what she doth.

He. She knoweth everything, and she will tell her
brother thou art come.

Men. Then must we die; for I cannot escape her
ken.

He. Perchance we might by suppliant prayers
win her over.

Men. To what end? To what vain hope art thou
leading me?

He. That she should not tell her brother thou art
here.

Men. Suppose we persuade her, can we get away?

He. Easily, if she connive thereat; without her
knowledge, no.

Men. Be that thy task; women deal best with
women.

He. I will not fail, be sure, to clasp her knees.

Men. Come, then; only, suppose she reject our
proposals?

He. Thou wilt be slain, and I, alas! wedded by
force.

Men. Thou wilt betray me; that “force” of thine
is all an excuse.

He. Nay, by thy life I swear a sacred oath.

Men. What meanest thou? dost swear to die and
never to another husband yield?

He. Yes, by the self-same sword; I will fall by thy
side.

Men. On these conditions touch my right hand.

He. I do so, swearing I will quit the light of day
if thou art slain.

Men. I, too, will end my life if I lose thee.

He. How shall we die so as to insure our reputation
for this?

Men. I will slay thee and then myself upon the
summit of the tomb. But first will I in doughty
fight contest another’s claim to thee; and let who
will draw nigh! for I will not sully the lustre of my
845-905
Trojan fame, nor will I, on my return to Hellas, incur
a storm of taunts, as one who robbed Thetis of
Achilles; saw Aias, son of Telamon, fall a weltering
corpse; and the son of Neleus of his child bereft;
shall I then flinch myself from death for my own
wife? No, no! For if the gods are wise, o’er a brave
man by his foes laid low they lightly sprinkle the
earth that is his tomb, while cowards they cast forth
on barren rocky soil.

Ch. Grant, heaven, that the race of Tantalus may
at last be blest, and pass from sorrow unto joy!

He. Ah, woe is me! Yea, all my lot is woe; O
Menelaus, we are utterly undone! Behold! From forth
the house comes Theonoe, the prophetess. The palace
echoes as the bolts are unfastened; fly! yet what
use to fly? For whether absent or present she knows
of thy arrival here. Ah me! how lost am I! Saved
from Troy and from a barbarian land, thou hast
come only to fall a prey to barbarian swords.

*Enter Theonoe with handmaids.*

Theonoe. Lead on, bearing before me blazing
brands, and, as sacred rites ordain, purge with incense
every cranny of the air, that I may breathe
heaven’s breath free from taint; meanwhile do thou,
in case the tread of unclean feet have soiled the
path, wave the cleansing flame above it, and brandish
the torch in front, that I may pass upon my
way. And when to heaven ye have paid the customs
I exact, bear back into the house the brand from off
the hearth. What of my prophecy, Helen? how
stands it now? Thou hast seen thy husband Menelaus
arrive without disguise, reft of his ships, and of
thy counterfeit. Ah, hapless man! what troubles hast
thou escaped, and art come hither, and yet knowest
not whether thou art to return or to abide here; for
there is strife in heaven, and Zeus this very day will
sit in solemn conclave on thee. Hera, who erst was
thy bitter foe, is now grown kind, and is willing to
bring thee and thy wife safe home, that Hellas may
learn that the marriage of Paris was all a sham, assigned
to him by Cypris; but Cypris fain would mar
thy homeward course, that she may not be convicted,
or proved to have bought the palm of beauty
at the price of Helen in a futile marriage. Now the
decision rests with me, whether to ruin thee, as
Cypris wishes, by telling my brother of thy presence
here, or to save thy life by taking Hera’s side,
keeping my brother in the dark, for his orders are
that I should tell him, whensoe’er thou shouldst
reach these shores. Ho! one of you, go show my
brother this man is here, that I may secure my position.

He. Maiden, at thy knees I fall a suppliant, and
seat myself in this sad posture on behalf of myself
and him, whom I am in danger of seeing slain, after
I have so hardly found him. Oh! tell not thy brother
that my husband is returned to these loving arms;
save us, I beseech thee; never for thy brother’s sake
sacrifice thy character for uprightness, by evil and
unjust means bidding for his favour. For the deity
hates violence, and biddeth all men get lawful gains
without plundering others. Wealth unjustly gotten,
905-962
though it bring some power, is to be eschewed. The
breath of heaven and the earth are man’s common
heritage, wherein to store his home, without taking
the goods of others, or wresting them away by force.
Me did Hermes at a critical time, to my sorrow,
entrust to thy father’s safe keeping for this my lord,
who now is here and wishes to reclaim me. But
how can he recover me if he be slain? How could
thy sire restore the living to the dead? Oh! consider
ere that the will of heaven and thy father’s too;
would the deity or would thy dead sire restore their
neighbour’s goods, or would they forbear? restore
them, I feel sure. It is not, therefore, right that thou
shouldst attach more importance to thy wanton
brother than to thy righteous father. Yet if thou,
prophetess as thou art and believer in divine providence,
shalt pervert the just intention of thy father
and gratify thy unrighteous brother, ’tis shameful
thou shouldst have full knowledge of the heavenly
will, both what is and what is not, and yet be ignorant
of justice. Oh! save my wretched life from
the troubles which beset it, granting this as an accession
to our good fortune; for every living soul
loathes Helen, seeing that there is gone a rumour
throughout Hellas that I was false unto my lord,
and took up my abode in Phrygia’s sumptuous halls.
Now, if I come to Hellas, and set foot once more in
Sparta, they will hear and see how they were ruined
by the wiles of goddesses, while I was no traitress to
my friends after all; and so will they restore to me
my virtuous name again, and I shall give my daughter
in marriage, whom no man now will wed; and,
leaving this vagrant life in Egypt, shall enjoy the
treasures in my home. Had Menelaus met his doom
at some funeral pyre, [^1] with tears should I be cherishing
his memory in a far-off land, but must I lose
him now when he is alive and safe? Ah! maiden, I
beseech thee, say not so; grant me this boon, I pray,
and reflect thy father’s justice; for this is the fairest
ornament of children, when the child of a virtuous
sire resembles its parents in character.

Ch. Piteous thy pleading, and a piteous object
thou! But I fain would hear what Menelaus will say
to save his life.

Men. I will not deign to throw myself at thy
knees, or wet mine eyes with tears; for were I to
play the coward, I should most foully blur my Trojan
fame. And yet men say it shows a noble soul to
let the tear-drop fall in misfortune. But that will
not be the honourable course that I will choose in
preference to bravery, if what I shall say is honourable.
Art thou disposed to save a stranger seeking
in mere justice to recover his wife, why then
restore her and save us to boot; if not, this will not
be the first by many a time that I have suffered,
though thou wilt get an evil name. All that I deem
worthy of me and honest, all that will touch thy
heart most nearly, will I utter at the tomb of thy
sire with regret for his loss. Old king beneath this
962-1022
tomb of stone reposing, pay back thy trust! I ask
of thee my wife whom Zeus sent hither unto thee
to keep for me. I know thou canst never restore her
to me thyself, for thou art dead; but this thy daughter
will never allow her father once so glorious,
whom I invoke in his grave, to bear a tarnished
name; for the decision rests with her now. Thee,
too, great god of death, I call to my assistance, who
hast received full many a corpse, slain by me for
Helen, and art keeping thy wage; either restore
those dead now to life again, or compel the daughter
to show herself a worthy equal of her virtuous
sire, and give me back my wife. But if ye will rob
me of her, I will tell you that which she omitted in
her speech. Know then, maiden, I by an oath am
bound, first, to meet thy brother sword to sword,
when he or I must die; there is no alternative. But
if he refuse to meet me fairly front to front, and
seek by famine to chase away us suppliants twain
at this tomb, I am resolved to slay Helen, and then
to plunge this two-edged sword through my own
heart, upon the top of the sepulchre, that our streaming
blood may trickle down the tomb; and our two
corpses will be lying side by side upon this polished
slab, a source of deathless grief to thee, and to thy
sire reproach. Never shall thy brother wed Helen,
nor shall any other; I will bear her hence myself, if
not to my house, at any rate to death. And why this
stern resolve? Were I to resort to women’s ways and
weep, I should be a pitiful creature, not a man of
action. Slay me, if it seems thee good; I will not die
ingloriously; but better yield to what I say, that
thou mayst act with justice, and I recover my wife.

Ch. On thee, maiden, it rests to judge between
these arguments. Decide in such a way as to please
one and all.

Theon. My nature and my inclination lean towards
piety; myself, too, I respect, and I will never
sully my father’s fair name, or gratify my brother
at the cost of bringing myself into open discredit.
For justice hath her temple firmly founded in my
nature, and since I have this heritage from Nereus
I will strive to save Menelaus; wherefore, seeing it
is Hera’s will to stand thy friend, I will give my vote
with her. May Cypris be favourable to me! though
in me she hath no part, and I will try to remain a
maid alway. As for thy reproaches against my father
at this tomb; lo! I have the same words to utter; I
should be wronging thee, did I not restore thy wife;
for my sire, were he living, would have given her
back into thy keeping, and thee to her. Yea, for
there is recompense for these things as well amongst

[^1]: Slain as a prisoner of war to grace some hero’s funeral obsequies.

the dead as amongst all those who breathe the breath
of life. The soul indeed of the dead lives no more,
yet hath it a consciousness that lasts for ever, eter-
nal as the ether into which it takes the final plunge.
Briefly then to end the matter, I will observe strict
silence on all that ye prayed I should, and never
with my counsel will I aid my brother’s wanton
will. For I am doing him good service, though he
little thinks it, if I turn him from his godless life to
holiness. Wherefore devise yourselves some way of

1023-1069

escape; my lips are sealed: I will not cross your path.
First with the goddesses begin, and of the one— and
that one Cypris — crave permission to return unto
thy country; and of Hera, that her goodwill may
abide in the same quarter, even her scheme to save
thee and thy husband. And thou, my own dead sire,
shalt never, in so far as rests with me, lose thy holy
name to rank with evil-doers.
*Exit Theonoe.*

**Ch.** No man ever prospered by unjust practices,
but in a righteous cause there is hope of safety.

**He.** Menelaus, on the maiden’s side are we quite
safe. Thou must from that point start, and by con-
tributing thy advice, devise with me a scheme to
save ourselves.

**Men.** Hearken then; thou hast been a long while
in the palace, and art intimate with the king’s at-
tendants.

**He.** What dost thou mean thereby? for thou art
suggesting hopes, as if resolved on some plan for our
mutual help.

**Men.** Couldst thou persuade one of those who
have charge of cars and steeds to furnish us with a
chariot?

**He.** I might; but what escape is there for us who
know nothing of the country and the barbarian’s
kingdom?

**Men.** True; a dilemma. Well, supposing I conceal
myself in the palace and slay the king with this two-
edged sword?

**He.** His sister would never refrain from telling her
brother that thou wert meditating his death.

**Men.** We have not so much as a ship to make our
escape in; for the sea hath swallowed the one we
had.

**He.** Hear me, if haply even a woman can utter
words of wisdom. Dost thou consent to be dead in
word, though not really so?

**Men.** ’Tis a bad omen; still, if by saying so I
shall gain aught, I am ready to be dead in word,
though not in deed.

**He.** I, too, will mourn thee with hair cut short
and dirges, as is women’s way, before this impious
wretch.

**Men.** What saving remedy doth this afford us
twain? There is a flavour of deception in thy scheme.

**He.** I will beg the king of this country leave to
bury thee in a cenotaph, as if thou hadst really died
at sea.

**Men.** Suppose he grant it; how, e’en then, are we
to escape without a ship, after having committed
me to my empty tomb?

**He.** I will bid him give me a vessel, from which to
let drop into the sea’s embrace thy funeral offerings.

**Men.** A clever plan in truth, save in one particu-
lar; suppose he bid thee rear the tomb upon the
strand, thy pretext comes to naught.

**He.** But I shall say it is not the custom in Hellas
to bury those who die at sea upon the shore.

**Men.** Thou removest this obstacle too; I then
will sail with thee and help stow the funeral garni-
ture in the same ship.

**He.** Above all, it is necessary that thou and all thy

1069-1127

sailors who escaped from the wreck should be at
hand.

**Men.** Be sure if once I find a ship at her moorings,
they shall be there man for man, each with his sword.

**He.** Thou must direct everything; only let there
be winds to waft our sails and a good ship to speed
before them!

**Men.** So shall it be; for the deities will cause my
troubles to cease. But from whom wilt thou say
thou hadst tidings of my death?

**He.** From thee; declare thyself the one and only
survivor, telling how thou wert sailing with the son
of Atreus, and didst see him perish.

**Men.** Of a truth the garments I have thrown
about me, will bear out my tale that they were rags
collected from the wreckage.

**He.** They come in most opportunely, but they
were near being lost just at the wrong time. Maybe
that misfortune will turn to fortune.

**Men.** Am I to enter the palace with thee, or are
we to sit here at the tomb quietly?

**He.** Abide here; for if the king attempts to do
thee any mischief, this tomb and thy good sword
will protect thee. But I will go within and cut off
my hair, and exchange my white robe for sable
weeds, and rend my cheek with this hand’s blood-
thirsty nail. For ’tis a mighty struggle, and I see
two possible issues; either I must die if detected in
my plot, or else to my country shall I come and save
thy soul alive. O Hera! awful queen, who sharest
the couch of Zeus, grant some respite from their
toil to two unhappy wretches; to thee I pray, toss-
ing my arms upward to heaven, where thou hast
thy home in the star-spangled firmament. Thou,
too, that didst win the prize of beauty at the price of
my marriage; O Cypris! daughter of Dione, destroy
me not utterly. Thou hast injured me enough afore-
time, delivering up my name, though not my per-
son, to live amongst barbarians. Oh! suffer me to
die, if death is thy desire, in my native land. Why
art thou so insatiate in mischief, employing every
art of love, of fraud, and guileful schemes, and spells
that bring bloodshed on families? Wert thou but
moderate, only that! — in all else thou art by nature
man’s most welcome deity; and I have reason to say
so.
*Exit Helen.*

**Ch.** Thee let me invoke, tearful Philomel,
lurking ’neath the leafy covert in thy place of song,
most tuneful of all feathered songsters,
oh! come to aid me in my dirge,
trilling through thy tawny throat,
as I sing the piteous woes of Helen,
and the tearful fate of Trojan dames
made subject to Achaea’s spear,
on the day that there came to their plains
one who sped with foreign oar
across the dashing billows,
bringing to Priam’s race from Lacedaemon
thee his hapless bride, O Helen —
even Paris, luckless bridegroom,
by the guidance of Aphrodite.
And many an Achaean hath breathed his last
amid the spearmen’s thrusts and hurtling hail of stones,
and gone to his sad end;
for these their wives cut off their hair in sorrow,
and their houses are left without a bride;
and one of the Achaeans, that had but a single ship,

1127—1193

did light a blazing beacon on sea-girt Euboea,
and destroy full many of them,
wrecking them on the rocks of Caphareus
and the shores that front the Aegean main,
by the treacherous gleam he kindled;
when thou, O Menelaus, from the very day of thy start,
didst drift to harbourless hills, far from thy country
before the breath of the storm,
bearing on thy ship a prize that was no prize,
but a phantom made by Hera out of cloud
for the Danai to struggle over.
What mortal claims, by searching to the utmost limit,
to have found out the nature of God,
or of his opposite, or of that which comes between,
seeing as he doth this world of man
tossed to and fro by waves of contradiction
and strange vicissitudes?
Thou, Helen, art the daughter of Zeus;
for thy sire was the bird that nestled in Leda’s bosom;
and yet for all that art thou become a by-word for wickedness,
through the length and breadth of Hellas,
as faithless, treacherous wife and godless woman;
nor can I tell what certainty is,
whatever may pass for it amongst men.
That which gods pronounce have I found true.
O fools! all ye who try to win the meed of valour
through war and serried ranks of chivalry,
seeking thus to still this mortal coil, in senselessness;
for if bloody contests are to decide,
there will never be any lack of strife in the towns of men;
the maidens of the land of Priam left their bridal bowers,
though arbitration might have put thy quarrel right, O Helen.
And now Troy’s sons are in Hades’ keeping in the world below,
and fire hath darted on her walls, as darts the flame of Zeus,
and thou art bringing woe on woe to hapless sufferers in their misery.

*Enter Theoclymenus.*

**Theoclymenus.** All hail, my father’s tomb! I buried
thee, Proteus, at the place where men pass out, that
I might often greet thee; and so, ever as I go out and
in, I, thy son Theoclymenus, call on thee, father.
Ho! servants, to the palace take my hounds and
hunting nets! How often have I blamed myself for
never punishing those miscreants with death! I have
just heard that a son of Hellas has come openly to
my land, escaping the notice of the guard, a spy
maybe or a would-be thief of Helen; death shall be
his lot if only I can catch him. Ha! I find all my
plans apparently frustrated; the daughter of Tyn-
dareus has deserted her seat at the tomb and sailed
away from my shores. Ho! there, undo the bars,
loose the horses from their stalls, bring forth my
chariot, servants, that the wife, on whom my heart
is set, may not get away from these shores unseen,
for want of any trouble I can take.
*Enter Helen.*
Yet stay; for I see the object of my pursuit is still
in the palace, and has not fled. How now, lady, why
hast thou arrayed thee in sable weeds instead of
white raiment, and from thy fair head hast shorn
thy tresses with the steel, bedewing thy cheeks the
while with tears but lately shed? Is it in response
to visions of the night that thou art mourning, or,
because thou hast heard some warning voice within,
art thus distraught with grief?

**He.** My lord — for already I have learnt to say

1194-1226

that name — I am undone; my luck is gone; I cease
to be.

**Theoc.** In what misfortune art thou plunged?
What hath happened?

**He.** Menelaus, ah me! how can I say it? is dead,
my husband.

**Theoc.** I show no exultation in this news, yet am
I blest herein.

**He.** * * * *

**Theoc.** How knowest thou? Did Theonoe tell thee
this?

**He.** Both she, and one who was there when he
perished.

**Theoc.** What! hath one arrived who actually an-
nounces this for certain?

**He.** One hath; oh may he come e’en as I wish him to!

**Theoc.** Who and where is he? that I may learn
this more surely.

**He.** There he is, sitting crouched beneath the
shelter of this tomb.

**Theoc.** Great Apollo! what a bundle of unsightly
rags!

**He.** Ah me! methinks my own husband too is in
like plight.

**Theoc.** From what country is this fellow? whence
landed he here?

**He.** From Hellas, one of the Achaeans who sailed
with my husband.

**Theoc.** What kind of death doth he declare that
Menelaus died?

**He.** The most piteous of all; amid the watery
waves at sea.

**Theoc.** On what part of the savage ocean was he
sailing?

**He.** Cast up on the harbourless rocks of Libya.

**Theoc.** How was it this man did not perish if he
was with him aboard?

**He.** There are times when churls have more luck
than their betters.

**Theoc.** Where left he the wreck, on coming hither?

**He.** There, where perdition catch it, but not
Menelaus!

**Theoc.** He is lost; but on what vessel came this man?

**He.** According to his story sailors fell in with him
and picked him up.

**Theoc.** Where then is that mischievous thing that
was sent to Troy in thy stead?

**He.** Dost mean the phantom-form of cloud? It
hath passed into the air.

**Theoc.** O Priam, and thou land of Troy, how
fruitless thy ruin!

**He.** I too have shared with Priam’s race their
misfortunes.

**Theoc.** Did this fellow leave thy husband unbur-
ied, or consign him to the grave?

**He.** Unburied; woe is me for my sad lot!

**Theoc.** Wherefore hast thou shorn the tresses of
thy golden hair?

**He.** His memory lingers fondly in this heart,
whate’er his fate.

**Theoc.** Are thy tears in genuine sorrow for this
calamity?

1227-1260

**He.** An easy task no doubt to escape thy sister’s
detection!

**Theoc.** No, surely; impossible. Wilt thou still make
this tomb thy abode?

**He.** Why jeer at me? canst thou not let the dead
man be?

**Theoc.** No, thy loyalty to thy husband’s memory
makes thee fly from me.

**He.** I will do so no more; prepare at once for my
marriage.

**Theoc.** Thou hast been long in bringing thyself to
it; still I do commend thee now.

**He.** Dost know thy part? Let us forget the past.

**Theoc.** On what terms? One good turn deserves
another.

**He.** Let us make peace; be reconciled to me.

**Theoc.** I relinquish my quarrel with thee; let it
take wings and fly away.

**He.** Then by thy knees, since thou art my friend
indeed —

**Theoc.** What art so bent on winning, that to me
thou stretchest out a suppliant hand?

**He.** My dead husband would I fain bury.

**Theoc.** What tomb can be bestowed on lost bodies?
Wilt thou bury a shade?

**He.** In Hellas we have a custom, whene’er one is
drowned at sea —

**Theoc.** What is your custom? The race of Pelops
truly hath some skill in matters such as this.

**He.** To hold a burial with woven robes that wrap
no corpse.

**Theoc.** Perform the ceremony; rear the tomb
where’er thou wilt.

**He.** ’Tis not thus we give drowned sailors burial.

**Theoc.** How then? I know nothing of your cus-
toms in Hellas.

**He.** We unmoor, and carry out to sea all that is
the dead man’s due.

**Theoc.** What am I to give thee then for thy dead
husband?

**He.** Myself I cannot say; I had no such experience
in my previous happy life.

**Theoc.** Stranger, thou art the bearer of tidings I
welcome.

**Men.** Well, I do not, nor yet doth the dead
man.

**Theoc.** How do ye bury those who have been
drowned at sea?

**Men.** Each according to his means.

**Theoc.** As far as wealth goes, name thy wishes for
this lady’s sake.

**Men.** There must be a blood-offering first to the
dead.

**Theoc.** Blood of what? Do thou show me and I
will comply.

**Men.** Decide that thyself; whate’er thou givest
will suffice.

**Theoc.** Amongst barbarians ’tis customary to sac-
rifice a horse or bull.

**Men.** If thou givest at all, let there be nothing
mean in thy gift.

**Theoc.** I have no lack of such in my rich herds.

1261-1305

**Men.** Next an empty bier is decked and carried
in procession.

**Theoc.** It shall be so; what else is it customary to
add?

**Men.** Bronze arms; for war was his delight.

**Theoc.** These will be worthy of the race of Pelops,
and these will we give.

**Men.** And with them all the fair increase of pro-
ductive earth.

**Theoc.** And next, how do ye pour these offerings
into the billows?

**Men.** There must be a ship ready and rowers.

**Theoc.** How far from the shore does the ship put
out?

**Men.** So far that the foam in her wake can scarce
be seen from the strand.

**Theoc.** Why so? wherefore doth Hellas observe
this custom?

**Men.** That the billow may not cast up again our
expiatory offerings.

**Theoc.** Phoenician rowers will soon cover the dis-
tance.

**Men.** ’Twill be well done, and gratifying to Men-
elaus, too.

**Theoc.** Canst thou not perform these rites well
enough without Helen?

**Men.** This task belongs to mother, wife, or chil-
dren.

**Theoc.** ’Tis her task then, according to thee, to
bury her husband.

**Men.** To be sure; piety demands that the dead
be not robbed of their due.

**Theoc.** Well, let her go; ’tis my interest to foster
piety in a wife. And thou, enter the house and
choose adornment for the dead. Thyself, too, will I
not send empty-handed away, since thou hast done
her a service. And for the good news thou hast
brought me, thou shalt receive raiment instead of
going bare, and food, too, that thou mayst reach
thy country; for as it is, I see thou art in sorry plight.
As for thee, poor lady, waste not thyself in a hope-
less case; Menelaus has met his doom, and thy dead
husband cannot come to life.

**Men.** This then is thy duty, fair young wife; be
content with thy present husband, and forget him
who has no existence; for this is thy best course in
face of what is happening. And if ever I come to
Hellas and secure my safety, I will clear thee of thy
former ill-repute, if thou prove a dutiful wife to thy
true husband.

**He.** I will; never shall my husband have cause to
blame me; thou shalt thyself attend us and be wit-
ness thereto. Now go within, poor wanderer, and
seek the bath, and change thy raiment. I will show
my kindness to thee, and that without delay. For
thou wilt perform all service due with kindlier feel-
ing for my dear lord Menelaus, if at my hands thou
meet with thy deserts.

*Exeunt Theoclymenus, Helen, Menelaus.*

**Ch.** Through wooded glen, o’er torrent’s flood,
and ocean’s booming waves rushed the mountain-
goddess, mother of the gods, in frantic haste, once

1305-1385

long ago, yearning for her daughter lost, whose name
men dare not utter; loudly rattled the Bacchic cas-
tanets in shrill accord, what time those maidens,
swift as whirlwinds, sped forth with the goddess on
her chariot yoked to wild creatures, in quest of her
that was ravished from the circling choir of virgins;
here was Artemis with her bow, and there the grim-
eyed goddess, sheathed in mail, and spear in hand. . . .
But Zeus looked down from his throne in heaven,
and turned the issue otherwhither.
Soon as the mother ceased from her wild wandering toil,
in seeking her daughter stolen so subtly as to baffle all pursuit,
she crossed the snow-capped heights of Ida’s nymphs;
and in anguish cast her down amongst the rocks and brushwood deep in snow;
and, denying to man all increase to his tillage from those barren fields,
she wasted the human race;
nor would she let the leafy tendrils yield luxuriant fodder for the cattle,
wherefore many a beast lay dying;
no sacrifice was offered to the gods,
and on the altars were no cakes to burn;
yea, and she made the dew-fed founts of crystal water to cease their flow,
in her insatiate sorrow for her child.
But when for gods and tribes of men alike she made an end to festal cheer,
Zeus spoke out, seeking to soothe the mother’s moody soul,
“Ye stately Graces, go banish from Demeter’s angry heart
the grief her wanderings bring upon her for her child,
and go, ye Muses too, with tuneful choir.”
Thereon did Cypris, fairest of the blessed gods,
first catch up the crashing cymbals, native to that land,
and the drum with tight-stretched skin,
and then Demeter smiled, and in her hand did take the deep-toned flute,
well pleased with its loud note.

Thou hast wedded as thou never shouldst have done
in defiance of all right,
and thou hast incurred, my daughter, the wrath of the great mother
by disregarding her sacrifices.
Oh! mighty is the virtue in a dress of dappled fawn-skin,
in ivy green that twineth round a sacred thyrsus,
in whirling tambourines struck as they revolve in air,
in tresses wildly streaming for the revelry of Bromius,
and likewise in the sleepless vigils of the goddess,
when the moon looks down and sheds her radiance o’er the scene.
Thou wert confident in thy charms alone.

*Enter Helen.*

**He.** My friends, within the palace all goes well
for us; for the daughter of Proteus, who is privy to
our stealthy scheme, told her brother nothing when
questioned as to my husband’s coming, but for my
sake declared him dead and buried. Most fortunate
it is my lord hath had the luck to get these weapons;
for he is now himself clad in the harness he was to
plunge into the sea, his stalwart arm thrust through
the buckler’s strap, and in his right hand a spear, on
pretence of joining in homage to the dead. He hath
girded himself most serviceably for the fray, as if to
triumph o’er a host of barbarian foes when once we
are aboard yon oared ship; instead of his rags from
the wreck hath he donned the robes I gave for his
attire, and I have bathed his limbs in water from
the stream, a bath he long hath wanted. But I must
be silent, for from the house comes forth the man

1385-1429

who thinks he has me in his power, prepared to be
his bride; and thy goodwill I also claim and thy
strict silence, if haply, when we save ourselves, we
may save thee too some day.

*Enter Theoclymenus and Menelaus.*

**Theoc.** Advance in order, servants, as the stranger
hath directed, bearing the funeral gifts the sea de-
mands. But thou, Helen, if thou wilt not miscon-
strue my words, be persuaded and here abide; for
thou wilt do thy husband equal service whether
thou art present or not. For I am afraid that some
sudden shock of fond regret may prompt thee to
plunge into the swollen tide, in an ecstasy of grati-
tude toward thy former husband; for thy grief for
him, though he is lost, is running to excess.

**He.** O my new lord, needs must I honour him
with whom I first shared married joys; for I could
even die with my husband, so well I loved him; yet
how could he thank me, were I to share death’s
doom with him? Still, let me go and pay his funeral
rites unto the dead in person. The gods grant thee
the boon I wish and this stranger too, for the assist-
ance he is lending here! And thou shalt find in me
a wife fit to share thy house, since thou art render-
ing kindness to Menelaus and to me; for surely these
events are to some good fortune tending. But now
appoint someone to give us a ship wherein to con-
vey these gifts, that I may find thy kindness made
complete.

**Theoc.** (To an attendant) Go thou, and furnish
them with a Sidonian galley of fifty oars and rowers
also.

**He.** Shall not he command the ship who is order-
ing the funeral?

**Theoc.** Most certainly; my sailors are to obey
him.

**He.** Repeat the order, that they may clearly un-
derstand thee.

**Theoc.** I repeat it, and will do so yet again if that
is thy pleasure.

**He.** Good luck to thee and to me in my designs!

**Theoc.** Oh! waste not thy fair complexion with
excessive weeping.

**He.** This day shall show my gratitude to thee.

**Theoc.** The state of the dead is nothingness; to
toil for them is vain.

**He.** In what I say, this world, as well as that, hath
share.

**Theoc.** Thou shalt not find in me a husband at all
inferior to Menelaus.

**He.** With thee have I no fault to find; good luck
is all I need.

**Theoc.** That rests with thyself, if thou show thy-
self a loving wife to me.

**He.** This is not a lesson I shall have to learn now,
to love my friends.

**Theoc.** Is it thy wish that I should escort thee in
person with active aid?

**He.** God forbid! become not thy servant’s serv-
ant, O king!

**Theoc.** Up and away! I am not concerned with
customs which the race of Pelops holds. My house

1430-1505

is pure, for Menelaus did not die here; go someone
now and bid my vassal chiefs bring marriage-offer-
ings to my palace; for the whole earth must re-echo
in glad accord the hymn of my wedding with Helen,
to make men envious. Go, stranger, and pour into
the sea’s embrace these offerings to Helen’s former
lord, and then speed back again with my bride, that
after sharing with me her marriage-feast thou mayst
set out for home, or here abide in happiness.

*Exit Theoclymenus.*

**Men.** O Zeus, who art called the father of all and
god of wisdom, look down on us and change our woe
to joy! Lend us thy ready help, as we seek to drag
our fortunes up the rugged hill; if with but thy
finger-tip thou touch us, we shall reach our longed-
for goal. Sufficient are the troubles we ere this have
undergone. Full oft have I invoked you gods to hear
my joys and sorrows; I do not deserve to be for ever
unhappy, but to advance and prosper. Grant me
but this one boon, and so will ye crown my future
with blessing.
*Exeunt Menelaus and Helen.*

**Ch.** Hail! thou swift Phoenician ship of Sidon!
dear to the rowers, mother to the foam,
leader of fair dolphins’ gambols,
what time the deep is hushed and still,
and Ocean’s azure child, the queen of calm,
takes up her parable and says:
“Away! and spread your canvas to the ocean-breeze.
Ho! sailors, ho! come grip your oars of pine,
speeding Helen on her way to the sheltered beach
where Perseus dwelt of yore.”[^1]
It may be thou wilt find the daughters[^2] of Leucippus
beside the brimming river[^3] or before the temple of Pallas,
when at last with dance and revelry
thou joinest in the merry midnight festival of Hyacinthus,
him whom Phoebus slew in the lists by a quoit hurled o’er the mark;
wherefore did the son of Zeus ordain that Laconia’s land
should set apart that day for sacrifice;
there too shalt thou find the tender maid,[^4]
whom ye left in your house, for as yet no nuptial torch has shed its light for her.

Oh! for wings to cleave the air in the track of Libyan cranes,
whose serried ranks leave far behind the wintry storm
at the shrill summons of some veteran leader,
who raises his exultant cry as he wings his way
o’er plains that know no rain and yet bear fruitful increase.
Ye feathered birds with necks outstretched,
comrades of the racing clouds, on! on!
till ye reach the Pleiads in their central station
and Orion, lord of the night;
and as ye settle on Eurotas’ banks
proclaim the glad tidings that Menelaus hath sacked the city of Dardanus,
and will soon be home.
Ye sons of Tyndareus at length appear,
speeding in your chariot through the sky,
denizens of heaven’s courts beneath the radiant whirling stars,
guide this lady Helen safely o’er the azure main,
across the foam-flecked billows of the deep-blue sea,
sending the mariners a favouring gale from Zeus;

1506-1562

and from your sister snatch the ill-repute of wed-
ding with a barbarian, even the punishment be-
queathed to her from that strife on Ida’s mount,
albeit she never went to the land of Ilium, to the
battlements of Phoebus.

*Enter Theoclymenus and Messenger.*

**Messenger.** O king, at last have I found thee in the
palace; for new tidings of woe art thou soon to hear
from me.

**Theoc.** How now?

**Mes.** Make haste to woo a new wife; for Helen
hath escaped.

**Theoc.** Borne aloft on soaring wings, or treading
still the earth?

**Mes.** Menelaus has succeeded in bearing her hence;
’twas he that brought the news of his own death.

**Theoc.** O monstrous story! what ship conveyed
her from these shores? Thy tale is past belief.

**Mes.** The very ship thou didst thyself give the
stranger; and that thou mayest briefly know all, he
is gone, taking thy sailors with him.

**Theoc.** How was it? I long to know, for I never
gave it a thought that a single arm could master all
those sailors with whom thou wert despatched.

**Mes.** Soon as the daughter of Zeus had left this
royal mansion and come unto the sea, daintily pick-
ing her way, most craftily she set to mourn her hus-
band, though he was not dead but at her side. Now
when we reached thy docks well walled, we began
to launch the fastest of Sidonian ships, with her full
complement of fifty rowers, and each task in due
succession followed; some set up the mast, others
ranged the oars with their blades ready, and stored
the white sails within the hold, and the rudder was
let down astern and fastened securely. While we
were thus employed, those Hellenes, who had been
fellow-voyagers with Menelaus, were watching us,
it seems, and they drew nigh the beach, clad in the
rags of shipwrecked men — well built enough, but
squalid to look upon. And the son of Atreus, direct-
ly he saw them approach, bespoke them, craftily
introducing the reason for his mourning: “Ye hap-
less mariners, how have ye come hither? your Achaean
ship where wrecked? Are ye here to help bury dead
Atreus’ son, whose missing body this lady, daughter
of Tyndareus, is honouring with a cenotaph?” Then
they with feigned tears proceeded to the ship, bearing

[^1]: i.e. to Mycenae, said to have been founded by Perseus.
[^2]: The daughters of Leucippus were priestesses of Athena and Artemis.
[^3]: i.e. the Eurotas in Sparta, and the temple of the “Brazen House.”
[^4]: i.e. Hermione.

Bringing aboard the offerings to be thrown into the deep for Menelaus. Thereat were we suspicious, and communed amongst ourselves regarding the number of extra passengers; but still we kept silence out of respect for thy orders, for by entrusting the command of the vessel to the stranger thou didst thus spoil all. Now the other victims gave no trouble, and we easily put them aboard; only the bull refused to go forward along the gangway, but rolled his eyes around and kept bellowing, and, arching his back and glaring askance toward his horns, he would not let us touch him. But Helen’s lord cried out: “O! ye who laid waste the town of Ilium, come pick up yon bull, the dead man’s offering, on your stout shoulders, as is the way in Hellas, and cast him into the

(1565-1618)

hold”; and as he spoke he drew his sword in readiness. Then they at his command came and caught up the bull and carried him bodily on to the deck. And Menelaus stroked the horse on neck and brow, coaxing it to go aboard. At length, when the ship was fully freighted, Helen climbed the ladder with graceful step and took her seat midway betwixt the rowers’ benches, and he sat by her side, even Menelaus who was called dead; and the rest, equally divided on the right and left side of the ship, sat them down, each beside his man, with swords concealed beneath their cloaks, and the billows soon were echoing to the rowers’ song, as we heard the boatswain’s note. Now when we were put out a space not very far nor very near, the helmsman asked, “Shall we, sir stranger, sail yet further on our course, or will this serve? For thine it is to command the ship.” And he answered: “’Tis far enough for me,” while in his right hand he gripped his sword and stepped on to the prow; then standing o’er the bull to slay it, never a word said he of any dead man, but cut its throat and thus made prayer: “Poseidon, lord of the sea, whose home is in the deep, and ye holy daughters of Nereus, bring me and my wife safe and sound to Nauplia’s strand from hence!” Anon a gush of blood, fair omen for the stranger, spouted into the tide. One cried, “There is treachery in this voyage; why should we now sail to Nauplia? Give the order, helmsman, turn thy rudder.” But the son of Atreus, standing where he slew the bull, called to his comrades, “Why do ye, the pick of Hellas, delay to smite and slay the barbarians and fling them from the ship into the waves?” While to thy crew the boatswain cried the opposite command: “Ho! some of you catch up chance spars, break up the benches, or snatch the oar-blade from the thole, and beat out the brains of these our foreign foes.” Forthwith up sprang each man, the one part armed with poles that sailors use, the other with swords. And the ship ran down with blood; while Helen from her seat upon the stern thus cheered them on: “Where is the fame ye won in Troy? show it against these barbarians.” Then as they hasted to the fray, some would fall and some rise up again, while others hadst thou seen laid low in death. But Menelaus in full armour made his way, sword in hand, to any point where his watchful eye perceived his comrades in distress; so we leapt from the ship and swam, and he cleared the benches of thy rowers. Then did the prince set himself to steer, and bade them make a straight course to Hellas. So they set up the mast, and favouring breezes blew; and they are clear away, while I, from death escaped, let myself down by the anchor chain into the sea; and, just as I was spent, one threw me a rope and rescued me, and drew me to land to bring to thee this message. Ah! there is naught more serviceable to mankind than a prudent distrust.

**Ch.** I would never have believed that Menelaus could have eluded us and thee, O king, in the way he did on his coming.

**Theoc.** Woe is me! cozened by a woman’s tricks!

(1622-1641)

**Theoc.** My bride hath escaped me. If the ship could have been pursued and overtaken, I would have used every means forthwith to catch the strangers; as it is, I will avenge myself upon my treacherous sister, in that she saw Menelaus in my palace and did not tell me. Wherefore shall she nevermore deceive another by her prophetic art.

*Enter portress.*

**Po.** Ho, there! whither away so fast, my lord? on what bloody thought intent?

**Theoc.** Whither Justice calls me. Out of my path!

**Po.** I will not loose thy robe, for on grievous mischief art thou bent.

**Theoc.** Shalt thou, a slave, control thy master?

**Po.** Yea, for I am in my senses.

**Theoc.** I should not say so, if thou wilt not let me—

**Po.** Nay, but that I never will.

**Theoc.** Slay my sister most accursed.

**Po.** Say rather, most righteous.

**Theoc.** “Righteous”? she who betrayed me.

**Po.** There is an honourable treachery, which ’tis right to commit.

**Theoc.** By giving my bride to another?

**Po.** Only to those who had a better right.

**Theoc.** Who hath any rights o’er mine?

**Po.** He that received her from her father.

**Theoc.** Nay, but fortune gave her to me.

**Po.** And destiny took her away.

**Theoc.** ’Tis not for thee to decide my affairs.

**Po.** Only supposing mine be the better counsel.

**Theoc.** So I am thy subject, not thy ruler.

**Po.** Aye, a subject bound to do the right, and eschew the wrong.

**Theoc.** It seems thou art eager to be slain.

**Po.** Slay me; thy sister shalt thou never slay with my consent, but me perchance; for to die for their masters is the fairest death, that noble slaves can find.

*The Dioscuri appears above the stage.*

**The Dioscuri.** Restrain those bursts of rage that hurry thee to undue lengths, O Theoclymenus, king of this country. We are the twin sons of Zeus that call to thee by name, whom Leda bore one day, with Helen too who hath fled from thy palace. For thou art wroth for a marriage never destined for thee; nor is thy sister Theonoe, daughter of a Nereid goddess, wronging thee because she honours the word of God and her father’s just behests. For it was ordained that Helen should abide within thy halls up till the present time, but since Troy is razed to the ground and she hath lent her name to the goddesses, no longer need she stay; now must she be united in the self-same wedlock as before, and reach her home and share it with her husband. Withhold then thy malignant blade from thy sister, and believe that she herein is acting with discretion. Long, long ago had we our sister saved, seeing that Zeus has made us gods, but we were too weak for destiny as well as the deities who willed these things to be. This is my bidding to thee; while to my sister I say, “Sail on with thy husband; and ye shall have

(1661-1677)

a prosperous breeze; for we, thy brethren twain, will course along the deep and bring you safely to your fatherland. And when at last thy goal is reached and thy life ended, thou shalt be famous as a goddess, and with thy twin brethren share the drink-offering, and like us receive gifts from men, for such is the will of Zeus. Yea, and that spot[^1] where the son of Maia first appointed thee a home when from Sparta he removed thee, after stealing an image of thee from heaven’s mansions to prevent thy marriage with Paris, even the isle that lies like a sentinel along the Attic coast, shall henceforth be called by thy name amongst men, for that it welcomed thee when stolen from thy home. Moreover, Heaven ordains that the wanderer Menelaus shall find a home

(1677-1692)

within an island of the blest; for to noble souls hath the deity no dislike, albeit these oft suffer more than those of no account.”

**Theoc.** Ye sons of Leda and of Zeus, I will forego my former quarrel about your sister, nor seek to slay mine own any more. Let Helen to her home repair, if such is Heaven’s pleasure. Ye know that ye are sprung of the same stock as your sister, best of women, chastest too. Hail then for the true nobility of Helen’s soul, a quality too seldom found amongst her sex!

**Ch.** Many are the forms the heavenly will assumes; and many a thing God brings to pass contrary to expectation: that which was looked for is not accomplished, while Heaven finds out a way for what we never hoped; e’en such has been the issue here.

*Exeunt omnes.*
