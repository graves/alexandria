Scene: a street in Athens with the house of Chremylus in the background. Groping along in front is a blind man of sordid appearance, followed by Chremylus, an elderly citizen, and a slave, Cario, wearing wreaths of bay.

Cario. How hard it is, O Zeus and all ye Gods,
  To be the slave of a demented master!
  For though the servant give the best advice,
  Yet if his owner otherwise decide,
  The servant needs must share the ill results.
  For a man’s body, such is fate, belongs
  Not to himself, but to whoe’er has bought it.
  So much for that. But now with Loxias,
  Who from his golden tripod chants his high
  Oracular strains, I’ve got a bone to pick.
  A wise Physician-seer they call him, yet
  He has sent my master off so moody-mad,
  That now he’s following a poor blind old man,
  Just the reverse of what he ought to do.
  For we who see should go before the blind,
  But he goes after (and constrains me too)
  One who won’t answer even with a gr-r-r.
  I won’t keep silence, master, no I won’t,
  Unless you tell me why you’re following him.
  I’ll plague you, Sir; I know you won’t chastise me
  So long as I’ve this sacred chaplet on.
Chremylus. I’ll pluck it off, that you may smart
  the more,
  If you keep bothering.
Cario. Humbug! I won’t stop
  Until you have told me who the fellow is.
  You know I ask it out of love for you.
Chremylus. I’ll tell you, for of all my servants you
  I count the truest and most constant—thief.
  —I’ve been a virtuous and religious man
  Yet always poor and luckless.
Cario. So you have.
Chremylus. While Temple-breakers, orators, informers,
  And knaves grow rich and prosper.
Cario. So they do.
Chremylus. So then I went to question of the God—
  Not for myself, the quiver of my life
  Is well-nigh emptied of its arrows now—
  But for my son, my only son, to ask
  If, changing all his habits, he should turn
  A rogue, dishonest, rotten to the core.
  For such as they, methinks, succeed the best.
Cario. And what droned Phoebus from his wreaths
  of bay?
Chremylus. He told me plainly that with whomsoe’er
  I first forgathered as I left the shrine,
  Of him I never should leave go again,
  But win him back, in friendship, to my home.
Cario. With whom then did you first forgather?
Chremylus. Him.
Cario. And can’t you see the meaning of the God,
  You ignoramus, who so plainly tells you
  Your son should follow the prevailing fashion?
Chremylus. Why think you that?
Cario. He means that even the blind
  Can see ’tis better for our present life
  To be a rascal, rotten to the core.
Chremylus. ’Tis not that way the oracle inclines,
  It cannot be. ’Tis something more than that.
  Now if this fellow told us who he is,
  And why and wherefore he has come here now,
  We’d soon discover what the God intended.
Cario. (To Wealth) Hallo, you sirrah, tell me who
  you are,
  Or take the consequence! Out with it, quick!
Wealth. Go and be hanged!
Cario. O master, did you hear
  The name he gave?
Chremylus. ’Twas meant for you, not me.
  You ask in such a rude and vulgar way.
  (To Wealth) Friend, if you love an honest gentle¬
  man,
  Tell me your name.
Wealth. Get out, you vagabond!
Cario. O! O! Accept the omen, and the man.
Chremylus. O, by Demeter, you shall smart for this.
  Answer this instant or you die the death.
Wealth. Men, men, depart and leave me.
Chremylus. Wouldn’t you like it?
Cario. O master, what I say is far the best:
  I’ll make him die a miserable death.
  I’ll set him on some precipice, and leave him,
  So then he’ll topple down and break his neck.
Chremylus. Up with him!
Wealth. O pray don’t.
Chremylus. Do you mean to answer?
Wealth. And if I do, I’m absolutely sure
  You’ll treat me ill: you’ll never let me go.
Chremylus. I vow we will, at least if you desire it.
Wealth. Then first unhand me.
Chremylus. There, we both unhand you.
Wealth. Then listen, both: for I, it seems, must needs
  Reveal the secret I proposed to keep.
  Know then, I’m Wealth!
Chremylus. You most abominable
  Of all mankind, you, Wealth, and keep it snug!
Cario. You, Wealth, in such a miserable plight!
Chremylus. O King Apollo! O ye Gods and daemons!
  O Zeus! what mean you? are you really he?
Wealth. I am.
Chremylus. Himself?
Wealth. His own self’s self.
Chremylus. Whence come you
  So grimed with dirt?
Wealth. From Patrocles’s house,
  A man who never washed in all his life.
Chremylus. And this, your sad affliction, how came this?
Wealth. ’Twas Zeus that caused it, jealous of mankind.
  For, when a little chap, I used to brag
  I’d visit none except the wise and good
  And orderly; he therefore made me blind,
  That I might ne’er distinguish which was which,
  So jealous is he always of the good!
Chremylus. And yet ’tis only from the just and good
  His worship comes.
Wealth. I grant you that.
Chremylus. Then tell me,
  If you could see again as once you could,
  Would you avoid the wicked?
Wealth. Yes, I would.
Chremylus. And visit all the good?
Wealth. Yes; more by token
  I have not seen the good for many a day.
Chremylus. No more have I, although I’ve got my eyes.
Wealth. Come, let me go; you know my story now.
Chremylus. And therefore, truly, hold we on the more.
Wealth. I told you so: you vowed you’d let me go.
  I knew you wouldn’t.
Chremylus. O be guided, pray,
  And don’t desert me. Search where’er you will
  You’ll never find a better man than I.
Cario. No more there is, by Zeus—except myself.
Wealth. They all say that; but when in sober earnest
  They find they’ve got me, and are wealthy men,
  They place no limit on their evil ways.
Chremylus. Too true! And yet not every one is bad.
Wealth. Yes, every single one.
Cario. (Aside) You’ll smart for that.
Chremylus. Nay, nay, but hear what benefits you’ll get
  If you’re persuaded to abide with us.
  For well I trust,—I trust, with God to aid,
  That I shall rid you of this eye-disease,
  And make you see.
Wealth. For mercy’s sake, forbear.
  I do not wish to see again.
Chremylus. Eh? what?
Cario. O why, the man’s a born unfortunate!
Wealth. Let Zeus but hear their follies, and I know
  He’ll pay me out.
Chremylus. And doesn’t he do that now;
  Letting you wander stumbling through the world?
Wealth. Eh, but I’m horribly afraid of Zeus!
Chremylus. Aye, say you so, you cowardliest God alive?
  What! do you think the imperial power of Zeus
  And all his thunderbolts were worth one farthing,
  Could you but see, for ever so short a time?
Wealth. Ah, don’t say that, you wretches!
Chremylus. Don’t be frightened!
  I’ll prove that you’re far stronger, mightier far
  Than Zeus.
Wealth. You’ll prove that *I* am?
Chremylus. Easily.
  Come, what makes Zeus the Ruler of the Gods?
Cario. His silver. He’s the wealthiest of them.
Chremylus. Well,
  Who gives him all his riches?
Cario. Our friend here.
Chremylus. And for whose sake do mortals sacrifice
  To Zeus?
Cario. For his: and pray straight out for wealth.
Chremylus. ’Tis all his doing: and ’tis he can quickly
  Undo it if he will.
Wealth. How mean you that?
Chremylus. I mean that nevermore will mortal man
  Bring ox, or cake, or any sacrifice,
  If such thy will.
Wealth. How so?
Chremylus. How can he buy
  A gift to offer, if thy power deny
  The needful silver? Single-handed, thou,
  If Zeus prove troublesome, canst crush his power.
Wealth. Men sacrifice to Zeus for me?
Chremylus. They do.
  And whatsoever in the world is bright,
  And fair, and graceful, all is done for thee.
  For every mortal thing subserves to Wealth.
Cario. Hence for a little filthy lucre I’m
  A slave, forsooth, because I’ve got no wealth.
Chremylus. And those Corinthian huzzies, so they say,
  If he who sues them for their love is poor,
  Turn up their noses at the man; but grant
  A wealthy suitor more than he desires.
Cario. So too the boy-loves; just to get some money,
  And not at all because they love their lovers.
Chremylus. Those are the baser, not the nobler sort,
  These never ask for money.
Cario. No? what then?
Chremylus. O one a hunter, one a pack of hounds.
Cario. Ah, they’re ashamed, I warrant, of their vice,
  And seek to crust it over with a name.
Chremylus. And every art existing in the world,
  And every craft, was for thy sake invented.
  For thee one sits and cobbles all the day,
  One works in bronze, another works in wood,
  One fuses gold—the gold derived from thee—
Cario. One plies the footpad’s, one the burglar’s
  trade,
Chremylus. One is a fuller, one a sheepskin-washer,
  One is a tanner, one an onion-seller,
  Through thee the nabbed adulterer gets off
  plucked.
Wealth. O, and all this I never knew before!
Chremylus. Aye, ’tis on him the Great King plumes
  himself;
  And our Assemblies all are held for him;
  Dost thou not man our triremes? Answer that.
  Does he not feed the foreign troop at Corinth?
  Won’t Pamphilus be brought to grief for him?
Cario. Won’t Pamphilus and the needle-seller too?
  Does not Agyrrhius flout us all for him?
Chremylus. Does not Philepsius tell his tales for thee?
  Dost thou not make the Egyptians our allies?
  And Lais love the uncouth Philonides?
Cario. Timotheus’ tower—
Chremylus. Pray Heaven it fall and crush you!
  Aye, everything that’s done is done for thee.
  Thou art alone, thyself alone, the source
  Of all our fortunes, good and bad alike.
  ’Tis so in war; wherever he alights,
  That side is safe the victory to win.
Wealth. Can I, unaided, do such feats as these?
Chremylus. O yes, by Zeus, and many more than these.
  So that none ever has enough of thee.
  Of all things else a man may have too much,
  Of love,
Cario. Of loaves,
Chremylus. Of literature,
Cario. Of sweets,
Chremylus. Of honour,
Cario. Cheesecakes,
Chremylus. Manliness,
Cario. Dried figs,
Chremylus. Ambition,
Cario. Barley-meal,
Chremylus. Command,
Cario. Pea soup.
Chremylus. But no man ever has enough of thee.
  For give a man a sum of thirteen talents,
  And all the more he hungers for sixteen;
  Give him sixteen, and he must needs have forty
  Or life’s not worth his living, so he says.
Wealth. Ye seem to me to speak extremely well,
  Yet on one point I’m fearful.
Chremylus. What is that?
Wealth. This mighty power which ye ascribe to me,
  I can’t imagine how I’m going to wield it.
Chremylus. O this it is that all the people say,
  “Wealth is the cowardliest thing.”
Wealth. It is not true.
  That is some burglar’s slander; breaking into
  A wealthy house, he found that everything
  Was under lock and key, and so got nothing:
  Wherefore he called my forethought, cowardliness.
Chremylus. Well, never mind; assist us in the work
  And play the man; and very soon I’ll make you
  Of keener sight than ever Lynceus was.
Wealth. Why, how can you, a mortal man, do that?
Chremylus. Good hope have I from that which Phoebus
  told me,
  Shaking the Pythian laurel as he spoke.
Wealth. Is Phoebus privy to your plan?
Chremylus. He is.
Wealth. Take heed!
Chremylus. Don’t fret yourself, my worthy friend.
  I am the man: I’ll work the matter through,
  Though I should die for it.
Cario. And so will I.
Chremylus. And many other bold allies will come,
  Good virtuous men without a grain of—barley.
Wealth. Bless me! a set of rather poor allies.
Chremylus. Not when you’ve made them wealthy men
  once more.
  Hi, Cario, run your fastest, and
Cario. Do what?
Chremylus. Summon my farm-companions from the
  fields
  (You’ll find them there, poor fellows, hard at
  work),
  And fetch them hither; so that each and all
  May have, with me, an equal share in Wealth.
Cario. Here goes! I’m off. Come out there, somebody,
  And carry in my little piece of meat.
  *Exit Cario.*
Chremylus. I’ll see to that: you, run away directly.
  But thou, dear Wealth, the mightiest Power of all,
  Come underneath my roof. Here stands the house,
  Which thou art going evermore to fill
  With wealth and plenty, by fair means or foul.
Wealth. And yet it irks me, I protest it does,
  To enter in beneath a stranger’s roof.
  I never got the slightest good from that.
  Was it a miser’s house; the miser straight
  Would dig a hole and pop me underground;
  And if some worthy neighbour came to beg
  A little silver for his urgent needs,
  Would vow he’d never seen me in his life.
  Or was it some young madcap’s: in a jiffy
  Squandered and lost amongst his drabs and dice
  I’m bundled, naked, out of house and home.
Chremylus. You never chanced upon a moderate man,
  But now you have; for such a man am I.
  For much I joy in saving, no man more,
  And much in spending when ’tis right to spend.
  So go we in; I long to introduce
  My wife and only son whom most I love—
  After yourself of course.
Wealth. That I believe.
Chremylus. Why should one say what is not true to you?
  *Exeunt.*

*Enter Cario with the Chorus of Needy Agriculturists.*

Cario. O ye who many a day have chewed
  a root of thyme with master,
  My labour-loving village-friends,
  be pleased to step out faster;
  Be staunch and strong, and stride along,
  let nothing now delay you,
  Your fortunes lie upon the die,
  come save them quick, I pray you.
Chorus. Now don’t you see we’re bustling, we,
  as fast as we can go, sir?
  We’re not so young as once we were,
  and Age is somewhat slow, sir.
  You’d think it fun to see us run,
  and that before you’ve told us
  The reason why your master seems
  so anxious to behold us.
Cario. Why, I’ve been telling long ago;
  ’tis you are not attending!
  He bade me call and fetch you all
  that you, forever ending
  This chill ungenial life of yours,
  might lead a life luxurious.
Chorus. Explain to me how that can be;
  i’faith I’m rather curious.
Cario. He’s got a man, an ancient man,
  of sorriest form and feature,
  Bald, toothless, squalid, wrinkled, bent,
  a very loathsome creature.
  I really should not be surprised
  to hear the wretch is circumcised.
Chorus. O Messenger of golden news,
  you thrill my heart with pleasure.
  I do believe the man has come
  with quite a heap of treasure!
Cario. O aye, he’s got a heap, I guess,
  a heap of woes and wretchedness.
Chorus. You think, I see, you think you’re free
  to gull me with impunity.
  No, no; my stick I’ve got and quick
  I’ll get my opportunity.
Cario. What, think you I’m the sort of man
  such things as that to do, sirs?
  Am I the man a tale to tell
  wherein there’s nothing true, sirs?
Chorus. How absolute the knave has grown!
  your shins, my boy, are bawling
  “Ah! Ah!” with all their might and main,
  for gyves and fetters calling.
Cario. You’ve drawn your lot; the grave you’ve got
  to judge in; why delay now?
  Old Charon gives the ticket there;
  why don’t you pass away now?
Chorus. Go hang yourself, you peevish elf,
  you born buffoon and scoffer.
  You love to tantalize and tease,
  nor condescend to offer
  A word of explanation why
  we’re summoned here so hurriedly.
  I had to shirk some urgent work,
  and here so quickly hasted,
  That many a tempting root of thyme
  I passed, and left untasted.
Cario. I’ll hide it not: ’tis Wealth we’ve got;
  the God of wealth we’ve captured,
  You’ll all be rich and wealthy now.
  Ha, don’t you look enraptured?
Chorus. He says we’ll all be wealthy now;
  upon my word this passes, sirs.
Cario. O yes, you’ll all be Midases,
  if only you’ve the asses’ ears.
Chorus. O I’m so happy, I’m so glad,
  I needs must dance for jollity,
  If what you say is really true,
  and not your own frivolity.
Cario. And I before your ranks will go,
  “*Threttanelo! Threttanelo!*”
  And I, the Cyclops, heel and toe,
  will dance the sailor’s hornpipe,—so!
  Come up, come up, my little ones all,
  come raise your multitudinous squall,
  Come bleating loudly the tuneful notes
  Of sheep and of rankly-odorous goats.
  Come follow along on your loves intent;
  come goats, ’tis time to your meal ye went.
Chorus. And you we’ll seek where’er you go,
  “*Threttanelo! Threttanelo!*”
  And you, the Cyclops, will we find
  in dirty, drunken sleep reclined,
  Your well-stuffed wallet beside you too,
  with many a potherb bathed in dew.
  And then from out of the fire we’ll take
  A sharply-pointed and burning stake,
  And whirling it round till our shoulders ache,
  its flame in your hissing eyeball slake.
Cario. And now I’ll change to Circe’s part,
  who mixed her drugs with baleful art;
  Who late in Corinth, as I’ve learned,
  Philonides’s comrades turned
  To loathsome swine in a loathsome sty,
  And fed them all on kneaded dung
  which, kneading, she amongst them flung.
  And turn you all into swine will I.
  And then ye’ll grunt in your bestial glee
  Wee! wee! wee!
  “Follow your mother, pigs,” quoth she.
Chorus. We’ll catch you, Circe dear, we will;
  who mix your drugs with baleful skill;
  Who with enchantments strange and vile
  ensnare our comrades and defile;
  We’ll hang you up as you erst were hung
  By bold Odysseus, lady fair;
  and then as if a goat you were
  We’ll rub your nose in the kneaded dung.
  Like Aristyllus you’ll gape with glee
  Wee! wee! wee!
  “Follow your mother, pigs,” quoth he.
Cario. But now, old mates, break off, break off;
  no longer may we jest and scoff;
  No longer play the fool to-day.
  And ye must sail on another tack,
  Whilst I, behind my master’s back,
  Rummage for meat and bread to eat,
  And then, whilst yet the food I chew,
  I’ll join the work we are going to do.
  *Exit Cario to get his bread and meat; enter Chremylus.*
Chremylus. To bid you “welcome,” fellow-burghers, now
  Is old and musty; so I—“clasp” you all.
  Ye who have come in this stout-hearted way,
  This strenuous way, this unrelaxing way,
  Stand by me now, and prove yourselves to-day
  In very truth the Saviours of the God.
Chorus. Fear not: I’ll bear me like the God of War.
  What, shall we push and hustle in the Assembly
  To gain our three poor obols, and to-day
  Let Wealth himself be wrested from our grasp?
Chremylus. And here, I see, comes Blepsidemus too.
  Look! by his speed and bearing you can tell
  He has heard a rumour of what’s happening here.

*Enter Blepsidemus.*

Blepsidemus. What can it mean? Old Chremylus
  grown wealthy!
  Then whence and how? I don’t believe that story.
  And yet by Heracles ’twas bruited wide
  Amongst the loungers in the barbers’ shops
  That Chremylus had all at once grown rich.
  And if he has, ’tis passing wonderful
  That he should call his neighbours in to share.
  That’s not our country’s fashion, anyhow.
Chremylus. I’ll tell him everything. O Blepsidemus,
  We’re better off to-day than yesterday.
  You are my friend, and you shall share in all.
Blepsidemus. What, are you really wealthy, as men say?
Chremylus. Well, if God will, I shall be presently.
  But there’s some risk, some risk, about it yet.
Blepsidemus. What sort of risk?
Chremylus. Such as—
Blepsidemus. Pray, pray go on.
Chremylus. If we succeed, we’re prosperous all our lives:
  But if we fail, we perish utterly.
Blepsidemus. I like not this; there’s something wrong behind,
  Some evil venture. To become, off-hand,
  So over-wealthy, and to fear such risks,
  Smacks of a man who has done some rotten thing.
Chremylus. Rotten! what mean you?
Blepsidemus. If you’ve stolen aught,
  Or gold or silver, from the God out there,
  And now perchance repent you of your sin—
Chremylus. Apollo shield us! no, I’ve not done that.
Blepsidemus. O don’t tell me. I see it plainly now.
Chremylus. Pray don’t suspect me of such crimes.
Blepsidemus. Alas!
  There’s nothing sound or honest in the world,
  The love of money overcomes us all.
Chremylus. Now by Demeter, friend, you have lost your
  wits.
Blepsidemus. O how unlike the man he used to be!
Chremylus. Poor chap, you’re moody-mad: I vow you are.
Blepsidemus. His very eye’s grown shifty: he can’t look you
  Straight in the face: I warrant he’s turned rogue.
Chremylus. I understand. You think I’ve stolen something,
  And want a share.
Blepsidemus. I want a share? in what?
Chremylus. But ’tis not so: the thing’s quite otherwise.
Blepsidemus. Not stol’n, but robbed outright?
Chremylus. The man’s possessed.
Blepsidemus. Have you embezzled someone else’s cash?
Chremylus. I haven’t: no.
Blepsidemus. O Heracles, where now
  Can a man turn! you won’t confess the truth.
Chremylus. You bring your charge before you have heard
  the facts.
Blepsidemus. Now prithee let me hush the matter up
  For a mere trifle, ere it all leaks out.
  A few small coins will stop the speakers’ mouths.
Chremylus. You’d like, I warrant, in your friendly way,
  To spend three minas, and to charge me twelve.
Blepsidemus. I see an old man pleading for his life
  With olive-branch in hand, and at his side
  His weeping wife and children, shrewdly like
  The suppliant Heracleids of Pamphilus.
Chremylus. Nay, luckless idiot, ’tis the good alone
  And right- and sober-minded that I’m going
  At once to make so wealthy.
Blepsidemus. Heaven and earth!
  What, have you stol’n so largely?
Chremylus. O confound it,
  You’ll be my death.
Blepsidemus. You’ll be your own, I fancy.
Chremylus. Not so, you reprobate; ’tis Wealth I’ve got.
Blepsidemus. You, Wealth! What sort of wealth?
Chremylus. The God himself.
Blepsidemus. Where? where?
Chremylus. Within.
Blepsidemus. Where?
Chremylus. In my house.
Blepsidemus. In yours?
Chremylus. Yes.
Blepsidemus. You be hanged! Wealth in your house?
Chremylus. I swear it.
Blepsidemus. Is this the truth?
Chremylus. It is.
Blepsidemus. By Hestia?
Chremylus. Aye; by Poseidon.
Blepsidemus. Him that rules the sea?
Chremylus. If there’s another, by that other too.
Blepsidemus. Then don’t you send him round for friends to
  share?
Chremylus. Not yet; things haven’t reached that stage.
Blepsidemus. What stage?
  The stage of sharing?
Chremylus. Aye. we’ve first to—
Blepsidemus. What?
Chremylus. Restore the sight—
Blepsidemus. Restore the sight of whom?
Chremylus. The sight of Wealth, by any means we can.
Blepsidemus. What, is he really blind?
Chremylus. He really is.
Blepsidemus. O that is why he never came to me.
Chremylus. But now he’ll come, if such the will of Heaven.
Blepsidemus. Had we not better call a doctor in?
Chremylus. Is there a doctor now in all the town?
  There are no fees, and therefore there’s no skill.
Blepsidemus. Let’s think awhile.
Chremylus. There’s none.
Blepsidemus. No more there is.
Chremylus. Why then, ’tis best to do what I intended,
  To let him lie inside Asclepius’ temple
  A whole night long.
Blepsidemus. That’s far the best, I swear it.
  So don’t be dawdling: quick; get something done.
Chremylus. I’m going.
Blepsidemus. Make you haste.
Chremylus. I’m doing that.

*Enter Poverty, a wild-looking woman.*

Poverty. You pair of luckless manikins who dare
  A rash, unholy, lawless deed to do—
  Where! What! Why flee ye? Tarry?
Blepsidemus. Heracles!
Poverty. I’ll make you die a miserable death.
  For ye have dared a deed intolerable
  Which no one else has ever dared to do,
  Or God or man! Now therefore ye must die.
Chremylus. But who are you that look so pale and wan?
Blepsidemus. Belike some Fury from a tragic play.
  She has a wild and tragic sort of look.
Chremylus. No, for she bears no torch.
Blepsidemus. The worse for her.
Poverty. What do you take me for?
Chremylus. Some pot-house girl
  Or omelette-seller: else you would not bawl
  At us so loudly ere you’re harmed at all.
Poverty. Not harmed! Why, is it not a shameful thing
  That you should seek to drive me from the land?
Chremylus. At all events you’ve got the Deadman’s Pit.
  But tell us quickly who and what you are.
Poverty. One who is going to pay you out to-day
  Because ye seek to banish me from hence.
Blepsidemus. Is it the barmaid from the neighbouring tap
  Who always cheats me with her swindling pint-
  pots?
Poverty. It’s Poverty, your mate for many a year!
Blepsidemus. O King Apollo and ye Gods, I’m off.
Chremylus. Hi! What are you at? Stop, stop, you coward
  you,
  Stop, can’t you?
Blepsidemus. Anything but that.
Chremylus. Pray stop.
  What! shall one woman scare away two men?
Blepsidemus. But this is Poverty herself, you rogue,
  The most destructive pest in all the world.
Chremylus. Stay, I implore you, stay.
Blepsidemus. Not I, by Zeus.
Chremylus. Why, this, I tell you, were the cowardliest deed
  That e’er was heard of, did we leave the God
  Deserted here, and flee away ourselves
  Too scared to strike one blow in his defence.
Blepsidemus. O, on what arms, what force, can we rely?
  Is there a shield, a corslet, anywhere
  Which this vile creature has not put in pawn?
Chremylus. Courage! the God will, single-handed, rear
  A trophy o’er this atrophied assailant.
Poverty. What! dare you mutter, you two outcasts you,
  Caught in the act, doing such dreadful deeds?
Chremylus. O, you accursed jade, why come you here
  Abusing us? We never did you wrong.
Poverty. No wrong, forsooth! O by the heavenly
  Powers
  No wrong to *me*, your trying to restore
  Wealth’s sight again?
Chremylus. How can it injure *you*,
  If we are trying to confer a blessing
  On all mankind?
Poverty. Blessing! what blessing?
Chremylus. What?
  Expelling you from Hellas, first of all.
Poverty. Expelling me from Hellas! Could you do
  A greater injury to mankind than that?
Chremylus. A greater? Yes; by not expelling you.
Poverty. Now that’s a question I am quite prepared
  To argue out at once; and if I prove
  That I’m the source of every good to men,
  And that by me ye live: but if I fail,
  Then do thereafter whatsoe’er ye list.
Chremylus. You dare to offer this, you vixen you?
Poverty. And you, accept it: easily enough
  Methinks I’ll show you altogether wrong
  Making the good men rich, as you propose.
Blepsidemus. O clubs and pillories! To the rescue! Help!
Poverty. Don’t shout and storm before you have heard
  the facts.
Blepsidemus. Who can help shouting, when he hears such
  wild
  Extravagant notions?
Poverty. Any man of sense.
Chremylus. And what’s the penalty you’ll bear, in case
  You lose the day?
Poverty. Whate’er you please.
Chremylus. ’Tis well.
Poverty. But, if ye are worsted, ye must bear the same.
Blepsidemus. (To Chremylus) Think you that twenty
  deaths are fine enough?
Chremylus. Enough for *her*; but two will do for us.
Poverty. Well then, be quick about it; for, indeed,
  How can my statements be with truth gainsaid?
Chorus. Find something, I pray, philosophic to say,
  whereby you may vanquish and rout her.
  No thought of retreat; but her arguments meet
  with arguments stronger and stouter.
Chremylus. All people with me, I am sure, will agree,
  for to all men alike it is clear,
  That the honest and true should enjoy, as their due,
  a successful and happy career,
  Whilst the lot of the godless and wicked should fall
  in exactly the opposite sphere.
  ’Twas to compass this end that myself and my friend
  have been thinking as hard as we can,
  And have hit on a nice beneficial device,
  a truly magnificent plan.
  For if Wealth should attain to his eyesight again,
  nor amongst us so aimlessly roam,
  To the dwellings I know of the good he would go,
  nor ever depart from their home.
  The unjust and profane with disgust and disdain
  he is certain thereafter to shun,
  Till all shall be honest and wealthy at last,
  to virtue and opulence won.
  Is there any design more effective than mine
  a blessing on men to confer?
Blepsidemus. No, nothing, that’s flat; I will answer for that;
  so don’t be inquiring of her.
Chremylus. For our life of to-day were a man to survey
  and consider its chances aright,
  He might fancy, I ween, it were madness or e’en
  the sport of some mischievous sprite.
  So often the best of the world is possessed
  by the most undeserving of men.
  Who have gotten their pile of money by vile
  injustice; so often again
  The righteous are seen to be famished and lean,
  yea, with thee as their comrade to dwell.
  Now if Wealth were to-night to recover his sight,
  and her from amongst us expel.
  Can you tell me, I pray, a more excellent way
  of bestowing a boon on mankind?
Poverty. O men on the least provocation prepared
  to be crazy and out of your mind,
  Men bearded and old, yet companions enrolled
  in the Order of zanies and fools,
  O what is the gain that the world would obtain
  were it governed by you and your rules?
  Why, if Wealth should allot himself equally out
  (assume that his sight ye restore),

# ARISTOPHANES

## THE PLUTUS

Then none would to science his talents devote  
or practise a craft any more.

Yet if science and art from the world should depart,  
pray whom would ye get for the future  
to build you a ship, or your leather to snip,  
or to make you a wheel or a suture?

Do ye think that a man will be likely to tan,  
or a smith or laundry to keep,  
or to break up the soil with his ploughshare, and toil  
the fruits of Demeter to reap,  
if regardless of these he can dwell at his ease,  
a life without labour enjoying?

**Chr.** Absurd! Why, the troubles and tasks you describe  
we of course shall our servants employ in.

**Po.** Your servants! But how will ye get any now?  
I pray you the secret to tell.

**Chr.** With the silver we’ve got we can purchase a lot.

**Po.** But who is the man that will sell?

**Chr.** Some merchant from Thessaly coming, belike,  
where most of the kidnappers dwell.  
Who still, for the sake of the gain he will make,  
with the slaves that we want will provide us.

**Po.** But first let me say, if we walk in the way  
wherein ye are seeking to guide us,  
there’ll be never a kidnapper left in the world.  
No merchant of course (can ye doubt it?)  
His life would expose to such perils as those  
had he plenty of money without it.  
No, no; I’m afraid you must handle the spade  
and follow the plough-tail in person,  
your life will have double the toil and the trouble  
it used to.

**Chr.** Thyself be thy curse on!

**Po.** No more on a bed will you pillow your head,  
for there won’t be a bed in the land,  
nor carpets; for whom will you find at the loom,  
when he’s plenty of money in hand?  
Rich perfumes no more will ye sprinkle and pour  
as home ye are bringing the bride,  
or apparel the fair in habiliments rare  
so cunningly fashioned and dyed.  
Yet of little avail is your wealth if it fail  
such enjoyments as these to procure you.  
Ye fools, it is I who alone a supply  
of the goods which ye covet ensure you.  
I sit like a Mistress, by Poverty’s lash  
constraining the needy mechanic;  
when I raise it, to earn his living he’ll turn,  
and work in a terrible panic.

**Chr.** Why, what have you got to bestow but a lot  
of burns from the bathing-room station,  
and a hollow-cheeked rabble of destitute hags,  
and brats on the verge of starvation?  
And the lice, if you please, and the gnats and the fleas  
whom I can’t even count for their numbers,  
who around you all night will buzz and will bite,  
and arouse you betimes from your slumbers.  
“Up! up!” they will shrill, “‘tis to hunger, but still  
up! up! to your pain and privation.”  
For a robe but a rag, for a bed but a bag  
of rushes which harbour a nation  
of bugs whose envenomed and tireless attacks  
would the soundest of sleepers awaken.  
And then for a carpet a sodden old mat,  
which is falling to bits, must be taken.  
And a jolly hard stone for a pillow you’ll own;  
and, for girdle-cakes, barley and wheaten.  
Must leaves dry and lean of the radish or e’en  
sour stalks of the mallow be eaten.  
And the head of a barrel, stove in, for a chair;  
and, instead of a trough, for your kneading  
a stave of a vat you must borrow, and that  
all broken. So great and exceeding  
are the blessings which Poverty brings in her train  
on the children of men to bestow!

**Po.** The life you define with such skill is not mine:  
’tis the life of a beggar, I trow.

**Chr.** Well, Poverty, Beggary, truly the twain  
to be sisters we always declare.

**Po.** Aye you! who to good Thrasybulus forsooth  
Dionysius the Tyrant compare!  
But the life I allot to my people is not,  
nor shall be, so full of distresses.  
’Tis a beggar alone who has nought of his own,  
nor even an obol possesses.  
My poor man, ’tis true, has to scrape and to screw  
and his work he must never be slack in;  
there’ll be no superfluity found in his cot;  
but then there will nothing be lacking.

**Chr.** Demeter! a life of the Blessed you give:  
forever to toil and to slave  
at Poverty’s call, and to leave after all  
not even enough for a grave.

**Po.** You are all for your jeers and your comedy-sneers,  
and you can’t be in earnest a minute  
nor observe that alike in their bodily frame  
and the spirit residing within it,  
my people are better than Wealth’s; for by him,  
men bloated and gross are presented,  
fat rogues with big bellies and dropsical legs,  
whose toes by the gout are tormented;  
but mine are the lean and the wasplike and keen,  
who strike at their foemen and sting them.

**Chr.** Ah, yes; to a wasplike condition, no doubt,  
by the pinch of starvation you bring them.

**Po.** I can show you besides that Decorum abides  
with those whom I visit; that mine  
are the modest and orderly folk, and that Wealth’s  
are “with insolence flushed and with wine.”

**Chr.** ’Tis an orderly job, then, to thieve and to rob  
and to break into houses by night.

**Bl.** Such modesty too! In whatever they do  
they are careful to keep out of sight.

**Po.** Behold in the cities the Orator tribe;  
when poor in their early career  
how faithful and just to the popular trust,  
how true to the State they appear.  
When wealth at the City’s expense they have gained,  
they are worsened at once by the pelf,  
intriguing the popular cause to defeat,  
attacking the People itself.

**Chr.** That is perfectly true though ’tis spoken by you,  
you spiteful malevolent witch!  
But still you shall squall for contending that all  
had better be poor than be rich.  
So don’t be elate; for a terrible fate  
shall your steps overtake before long.

**Po.** Why, I haven’t yet heard the ghost of a word  
to prove my contention is wrong.  
You splutter and try to flutter and fly:  
but of argument never a letter.

**Chr.** Pray why do all people abhor you and shun?

**Po.** Because I’m for making them better.  
So children, we see, from their parents will flee  
who would teach them the way they should go.  
So hardly we learn what is right to discern;  
so few what is best for them know.

**Chr.** Then Zeus, I suppose, is mistaken, nor knows  
what most for his comfort and bliss is,  
since money and pelf he acquires for himself.

**Bl.** And her to the earth he dismisses.

**Po.** O dullards and blind! full of styles is your mind;  
there are tumours titanic within it.  
Zeus wealthy! Not he: he’s as poor as can be:  
and this I can prove in a minute.  
If Zeus be so wealthy, how came it of yore  
that out of his riches abounding  
he could find but a wreath of wild olive for those  
who should win at the games he was founding,  
by all the Hellenes in each fourth year  
on Olympia’s plains to be holden?  
If Zeus were as wealthy and rich as you say,  
the wreath should at least have been golden.

**Chr.** It is plain, I should think, ’tis from love of the chink  
that the conduct you mention arises;  
the God is unwilling to lavish a doit  
of the money he loves upon prizes.  
The rubbish may go to the victors below;  
the gold he retains in his coffers.

**Po.** How dare you produce such a libel on Zeus,  
you couple of ignorant scoffers?  
’Twere better, I’m sure, to be honest and poor,  
than rich and so stingy and screwing.

**Chr.** Zeus crown you, I pray, with the wild olive spray,  
and send you away to your ruin!

**Po.** To think that you dare to persist and declare  
that Poverty does not present you  
with all that is noblest and best in your lives!

**Chr.** Will Hecate’s judgement content you?  
If you question her which are the better, the rich  
or the poor, she will say, I opine,  
“Each month do the wealthy a supper provide,  
to be used in my service divine,  
but the poor lie in wait for a snatch at the plate,  
or e’er it is placed on my shrine.”  
So away, nor retort with a g-r-r, you degraded  
importunate scold!  
Persuade me you may, but I won’t be persuaded.

**Po.** O Argos, behold!

**Chr.** Nay Pauson, your messmate, to aid you invite.

**Po.** O woe upon woe!

**Chr.** Be off to the ravens; get out of my sight.

**Po.** O where shall I go?

**Chr.** Go? Go to the pillory; don’t be so slack,  
nor longer delay.

**Po.** Ah me, but ye’ll speedily send for me back,  
who scout me to-day!

Exit POETRY (Poverty).

**Chr.** When we send for you, come; not before. So farewell!  
With Wealth as my comrade ’tis better to dwell.  
Get you gone, and bemoan your misfortunes alone.

**Bl.** I too have a mind for an opulent life  
of revel and mirth with my children and wife,  
untroubled by Poverty’s panics.  
And then as I’m passing, all shiny and bright,  
from my bath to my supper, what joy and delight  
my fingers to snap in disdain at the sight  
of herself and her frowsy mechanics.

**Chr.** That cursed witch, thank Heaven, has gone and left us.  
But you and I will take the God at once  
to spend the night inside Asclepius’ Temple.

**Bl.** And don’t delay one instant, lest there come  
some other hindrance to the work in hand.

**Chr.** Hi, boy there, Cario, fetch me out the blankets,  
and bring the God himself, with due observance,  
and whatsoever is prepared within.

After this they all quit the stage. A whole night is supposed to pass, and next day Cario suddenly runs in with joyful news. He addresses the chorus in the orchestra.

**Ca.** Here’s joy, here’s happiness, old friends, for you  
who, at the feast of Theseus, many a time  
have ladled up small sops of barley-broth!  
Here’s joy for you and all good folk besides.

**Ch.** How now, you best of all your fellow-knaves?  
You seem to come a messenger of good.

**Ca.** With happiest fortune has my master sped,  
or rather Wealth himself; no longer blind,  
“he hath relumed the brightness of his eyes,  
so kind a Healer hath Asclepius proved.”

**Ch.** (singing) Joy for the news you bring.  
Joy! Joy! with shouts I sing.

**Ca.** Aye, will you, nill you, it is joy indeed.

(Chorus continues singing)

Chorus (singing):  
Sing we with all our might Asclepius first and best,  
To men a glorious light, Sire in his offspring blest.

Enter Wife of Chremylus.

**Wife.** What means this shouting? Has good news arrived?  
For I’ve been sitting till I’m tired within,  
waiting for him, and longing for good news.

**Ca.** Bring wine, bring wine, my mistress; quaff yourself  
the flowing bowl; (you like it passing well).  
I bring you here all blessings in a lump.

**Wi.** Where?

**Ca.** That you’ll learn from what I am going to say.

**Wi.** Be pleased to tell me with what speed you can.

**Ca.** Listen. I’ll tell you all this striking business  
up from the foot on to the very head.

**Wi.** Not on my head, I pray you.

**Ca.** Not the blessings we have all got?

**Wi.** Not all that striking business.

**Ca.** Soon as we reached the Temple of the God  
bringing the man, most miserable then,  
but who so happy, who so prosperous now?  
Without delay we took him to the sea  
and bathed him there.

**Wi.** O what a happy man,  
the poor old fellow bathed in the cold sea!

**Ca.** Then to the precincts of the God we went.  
There on the altar honey-cakes and bakemeats  
were offered, food for the Hephaestian flame.  
There laid we Wealth as custom bids; and we  
each for himself stitched up a pallet near.

**Wi.** Were there no others waiting to be healed?

**Ca.** Neocleides was, for one; the purblind man,  
who in his thefts out-shoots the keenest-eyed.  
And many others, sick with every form  
of ailment. Soon the Temple servitor  
put out the lights, and bade us fall asleep,  
nor stir, nor speak, whatever noise we heard.  
So down we lay in orderly repose.  
And I could catch no slumber, not one wink,  
struck by a nice tureen of broth which stood  
a little distance from an old wife’s head,  
whereto I marvellously longed to creep.  
Then, glancing upwards, I behold the priest  
whipping the cheese-cakes and the figs from off  
the holy table; thence he coasted round  
to every altar, spying what was left.  
And everything he found he consecrated  
into a sort of sack; so I, concluding  
this was the right and proper thing to do,  
arose at once to tackle that tureen.

**Wi.** Unhappy man! Did you not fear the God?

**Ca.** Indeed I did, lest he should cut in first,  
garlands and all, and capture my tureen.  
For so the priest forewarned me he might do.  
Then the old lady when my steps she heard  
reached out a stealthy hand; I gave a hiss,  
and mouthed it gently like a sacred snake.  
Back flies her hand; she draws her coverlets  
more tightly round her, and, beneath them, lies  
in deadly terror like a frightened cat.  
Then of the broth I gobbled down a lot  
till I could eat no more, and then I stopped.

**Wi.** Did not the God approach you?

**Ca.** Not till later.  
And then I did a thing will make you laugh.  
For as he neared me, by some dire mishap  
my wind exploded like a thunder-clap.

**Wi.** I guess the God was awfully disgusted.

**Ca.** No, but Iaso blushed a rosy red  
and Panacea turned away her head  
holding her nose: my wind’s not frankincense.

**Wi.** But he himself?

**Ca.** Observed it not, nor cared.

**Wi.** O why, you’re making out the God a clown!

**Ca.** No, no; an ordure-taster.

**Wi.** Oh! you wretch.

**Ca.** So then, alarmed, I muffled up my head,  
whilst he went round, with calm and quiet tread,  
to every patient, scanning each disease.  
Then by his side a servant placed a stone  
pestle and mortar; and a medicine chest.

**Wi.** A stone one?

**Ca.** Hang it, not the medicine chest.

**Wi.** How saw you this, you villain, when your head,  
you said just now, was muffled?

**Ca.** Through my cloak.  
Full many a peep-hole has that cloak, I trow.  
Well, first he set himself to mix a plaster  
for Neocleides, throwing in three cloves  
of Tenian garlic; and with these he mingled  
verjuice and squills; and brayed them up together.  
Then drenched the mass with Sphettian vinegar,  
and turning up the eyelids of the man  
plastered their inner sides, to make the smart  
more painful. Up he springs with yells and roars  
in act to flee; then laughed the God, and said,  
“Nay, sit thou there, beplastered; I’ll restrain thee,  
thou reckless swearer, from the Assembly now.”

**Wi.** O what a clever, patriotic God!

**Ca.** Then, after this, he sat him down by Wealth,  
and first he felt the patient’s head, and next  
taking a linen napkin, clean and white,  
wiped both his lids, and all around them, dry.  
Then Panacea with a scarlet cloth  
covered his face and head; then the God clucked,  
and out there issued from the holy shrine  
two great enormous serpents.

**Wi.** O good heavens!

**Ca.** And underneath the scarlet cloth they crept  
and licked his eyelids, as it seemed to me;  
and, mistress dear, before you could have drunk  
of wine ten goblets, Wealth arose and saw.  
O then for joy I clapped my hands together  
and woke my master, and, hey presto! both  
the God and serpents vanished in the shrine.  
And those who lay by Wealth, imagine how  
they blessed and greeted him, nor closed their eyes  
the whole night long till daylight did appear.  
And I could never praise the God enough  
for both his deeds, enabling Wealth to see,  
and making Neocleides still more blind.

**Wi.** O Lord and King, what mighty power is thine!  
But prithee where is Wealth?

**Ca.** He’s coming here,  
with such a crowd collected at his heels.  
For all the honest fellows, who before  
had scanty means of living, flocking round,  
welcomed the God and clasped his hand for joy.  
— Though others, wealthy rascals, who had gained  
their pile of money by unrighteous means,  
wore scowling faces, knitted up in frowns, —  
but those went following on, begarlanded,  
with smiles and blessings; and the old men’s shoes  
rang out in rhythmic progress as they marched.  
Now therefore all, arise with one accord,  
and skip, and bound, and dance the choral dance,  
for nevermore, returning home, we’ll hear  
those fatal words: “No barley in the bin!”

**Wi.** By Hecate, for this good news you bring  
I’ve half a mind to crown you with a wreath  
of barley loaves.

**Ca.** Well, don’t be loitering now.  
The men, by this, are nearly at your gates.

**Wi.** Then I will in, and fetch the welcoming-gifts  
wherewith to greet these newly-purchased — eyes.

Exit WIFE.

**Ca.** And I will out, and meet them as they come.

Exit CARIO.

Enter Wealth, alone; to him later Chremylus, with a crowd at his heels.

**We.** And first I make obeisance to yon sun;  
then to august Athene’s famous plain,  
and all this hospitable land of Cecrops.  
Shame on my past career! I blush to think  
with whom I long consorted, unawares,  
whilst those who my companionship deserved  
I shunned, not knowing. O unhappy me!  
In neither this nor that I acted rightly.  
But now, reversing all my former ways,  
I’ll show mankind ’twas through no wish of mine  
I used to give myself to rogues and knaves.

**Chr.** Hang you, be off! the nuisance these friends are,  
emerging suddenly when fortune smiles.  
Tchah! How they nudge your ribs, and punch your shins,  
displaying each some token of goodwill.  
What man addressed me not? What aged group  
failed to enwreathe me in the market-place?

Enter Wife.

**Wi.** Dearest of men, O welcome you and you.  
Come now, I’ll take these welcoming-gifts and pour them  
o’er you, as custom bids.

**We.** Excuse me, no.  
When first I’m entering with my sight restored  
into a house, ’twere meeter far that I  
confer a largess rather than receive.

**Wi.** Then won’t you take the welcoming-gifts I bring?

**We.** Aye, by the hearth within, as custom bids.  
So too we ’scape the vulgar tricks of farce.  
It is not meet, with such a Bard as ours,  
to fling a shower of figs and comfits out  
amongst the audience, just to make them laugh.

**Wi.** Well said indeed: for Dexinicus there  
is rising up, to scramble for the figs.

They all enter the house: henceforth Cario and Chremylus come out by turns; they are never on the stage together. Some interval elapses before Cario’s first entrance.

**Ca.** How pleasant ’tis to lead a prosperous life,  
and that, expending nothing of one’s own.  
Into this house a heap of golden joys  
has hurled itself though nothing we’ve done wrong.  
Truly a sweet and pleasant thing is wealth.  
With good white barley is our garner filled  
and all our casks with red and fragrant wine.  
And every vessel in the house is crammed  
with gold and silver, wonderful to see.  
The tank o’erflows with oil; the oil-flasks teem  
with precious unguents; and the loft with figs.  
And every cruet, pitcher, pannikin,  
is turned to bronze; the mouldy trencherlets  
that held the fish are all of silver now.  
Our lantern, all at once, is ivory-framed.  
And we the servants, play at odd-or-even  
with golden staters; and to cleanse us, use  
not stones, but garlic-leaves, so nice we are.  
And master now, with garlands round his brow,  
is offering up hog, goat, and ram within.  
But me the smoke drove out. I could not bear  
to stay within; it bit my eyelids so.

Enter a prosperous and well-dressed citizen with an attendant carrying a tattered gaberdine and a disreputable pair of shoes.

**Good Man.** Now then, young fellow, come along with me  
to find the God.

**Ca.** Eh? Who comes here, I wonder.

**G. M.** A man once wretched, but so happy now.

**Ca.** One of the honest sort, I dare aver.

**G. M.** Aye, aye.

**Ca.** What want you now?

**G. M.** I am come to thank  
the God: great blessings hath he wrought for me.  
For I, inheriting a fair estate,  
used it to help my comrades in their need,  
esteeming that the wisest thing to do.

**Ca.** I guess your money soon began to fail.

**G. M.** Aye, that it did!

**Ca.** And then you came to grief.

**G. M.** Aye, that I did! And I supposed that they  
whom I had succoured in their need, would now  
be glad to help me when in need myself.  
But all slipped off as though they saw me not.

**Ca.** And jeered you. I’ll be bound.

**G. M.** Aye, that they did!  
The drought in all my vessels proved my ruin.

**Ca.** But not so now.

**G. M.** Therefore with right good cause  
I come with thankfulness to praise the God.

**Ca.** But what’s the meaning, by the Powers, of that,  
that ancient gaberdine your boy is bearing?

**G. M.** This too I bring, an offering to the God.

**Ca.** That’s not the robe you were initiate in?

**G. M.** No, but I shivered thirteen years therein.

**Ca.** Those shoes?

**G. M.** Have weathered many a storm with me.

**Ca.** And them you bring as votive offerings?

**G. M.** Yes.

**Ca.** What charming presents to the God you bring!

Enter Informer with witness.

**Informer.** O me unlucky! O my hard, hard fate!  
O thrice unlucky, four times, five times, yea  
twelve times, ten thousand times! O woe is me,  
so strong the spirit of ill-luck that swamps me.

**Ca.** Apollo shield us and ye gracious Gods,  
what dreadful misery has this poor wretch suffered?

**In.** What misery quoth’a? Shameful, scandalous wrong.  
Why, all my goods are spirited away  
through this same God, who shall be blind again  
if any justice can be found in Hellas.

**G. M.** Methinks I’ve got a glimmering of the truth.  
This is some wretched fellow, come to grief;  
belike he is metal of the baser sort.

**Ca.** Then well done he to come to wrack and ruin.

**In.** Where, where is he who promised he would make  
all of us wealthy in a trice, if only  
he could regain his sight? Some of us truly  
he has brought to ruin rather than to wealth.

**Ca.** Whom has he brought to ruin?

**In.** Me, this chap.

**Ca.** One of the rogues and housebreakers perchance?

**In.** O aye, by Zeus, and you’re quite rotten too.  
’Tis you have got my goods, I do believe.

**Ca.** How bold, Demeter, has the Informing rogue  
come blustering in! ’Tis plain he’s hunger-mad.

**In.** You, sirrah, come to the market-place at once,  
there to be broken on the wheel, and forced  
to tell your misdemeanours.

**Ca.** You be hanged!

**G. M.** O, if the God would extirpate the whole  
in former-brood, right well would he deserve,  
O Saviour Zeus, of all the Hellenic race!

**In.** You jeer me too? Alack, you shared the spoil,  
or whence that brand new cloak? I’ll take my oath  
I saw you yesterday in a gaberdine.

**G. M.** I fear you not. I wear an antidote,  
a ring Eudemus sold me for a drachma.

**Ca.** ’Tis not inscribed “For an Informer’s bite.”

**In.** Is not this insolence? Ye jest and jeer,  
and have not told me what you are doing here.  
’Tis for no good you two are here, I’m thinking.

**Ca.** Not for your good, you may be sure of that.

**In.** For off my goods ye are going to dine, I trow.

**Ca.** O that in very truth ye’d burst asunder,  
you and your witness, crammed with nothingness.

**In.** Dare ye deny it? In your house they are cooking  
a jolly lot of flesh and fish, you miscreants.

(The informer gives five double sniffs.)

**Ca.** Smell you aught, lackpurse?

**G. M.** Maybe ’tis the cold,  
look what a wretched gaberdine he’s wearing.

**In.** O Zeus and Gods, can such affronts be borne  
from rogues like these? O me, how vexed I am  
that I, a virtuous patriot, get such treatment.

**Ca.** What you a virtuous patriot?

**In.** No man more so.

**Ca.** Come then, I’ll ask you — Answer me.

**In.** Well.

**Ca.** Are you a farmer?

**In.** Do you take me for a fool?

**Ca.** A merchant?

**In.** Aye, I feign so, on occasion.

**Ca.** Have you learned any trade?

**In.** No, none by Zeus.

**Ca.** Then how and whence do you earn your livelihood?

**In.** All public matters and all private too  
are in my charge.

**Ca.** How so?

**In.** ’Tis I who will.

**Ca.** You virtuous housebreaker? When all men hate you  
meddling with matters which concern you not.

**In.** What, think you, booby, it concerns me not  
to aid the State with all my might and main?

**Ca.** To aid the State! Does that mean mischief-making?

**In.** It means upholding the established laws  
and punishing the rogues who break the same.

**Ca.** I thought the State appointed Justices  
for this one task.

**In.** And who’s to prosecute?

**Ca.** Whoever will.

**In.** I am that man who will.  
Therefore, at last, the State depends on me.

**Ca.** ’Fore Zeus, a worthless leader it has got.  
Come, will you this, to lead a quiet life  
and peaceful?

**In.** That’s a sheep’s life you’re describing,  
living with nothing in the world to do.

**Ca.** Then you won’t change?

**In.** Not if you gave me all  
Battus’s silphium, aye and Wealth to boot.

**Ca.** Put off your cloak!

**G. M.** Fellow, to you he’s speaking.

**Ca.** And then your shoes.

**G. M.** All this to you he’s speaking.

**In.** I dare you all. Come on and tackle me  
whoever will.

**Ca.** I am that man who will.

Exit WITNESS.

**In.** O me, they are stripping me in open day.

**Ca.** You choose to live by mischief-making, do you?

**In.** What are you at? I call you, friend, to witness.

**Ca.** Methinks the witness that you brought has cut it.

**In.** O me! I am trapped alone.

**Ca.** Aye, now you are roaring.

**Ca.** (to Good Man) Hand me your gaberdine, I’ll wrap this rogue of an Informer in it.

**G. M.** Nay, that long since is dedicate to Wealth.

**Ca.** Where can it then more aptly be suspended  
than on a rogue and housebreaker like this?  
Wealth we will decorate with nobler robes.

**G. M.** How shall we manage with my cast-off shoes?

**Ca.** Those on his forehead, as upon the stock  
of a wild olive, will I nail at once.

**In.** I’ll stay no longer; for, alone, I am weaker,  
I know, than you; but give me once a comrade,  
a willing one, and ere the day is spent  
I’ll bring this lusty God of yours to justice,  
for that, being only one, he is overthrowing  
our great democracy; nor seeks to gain  
the Council’s sanction, or the Assembly’s either.

Exit INFORMER.

**G. M.** Aye run you off, accoutred as you are  
in all my panoply, and take the station  
I held erewhile beside the bath-room fire,  
the Coryphaeus of the starvelings there.

**Ca.** Nay, but the keeper of the baths will drag him  
out by the ears; for he’ll at once perceive  
the man is metal of the baser sort.  
But go we in that you may pray the God.

The good man and Cario enter the house. Enter Old Lady with attendant, carrying cakes and sweetmeats on a tray.

**Old Lady.** Pray, have we really reached, you dear old men,  
the very dwelling where this new God dwells?  
Or have we altogether missed the way?

**Ch.** No, you have really reached his very door,  
you dear young girl; for girl-like is your speech.

**O. L.** O, then, I’ll summon one of those within.

Enter Chremylus.

**Chr.** Nay, for, unsummoned, I have just come out.  
So tell me freely what has brought you here.

**O. L.** O, sad, my dear, and anguished is my lot,

For ever since this God began to see
My life's been not worth living; all through him.

Chr. What, were you too a she-informer then
    Amongst the women?

O.L. No indeed, not I.

Chr. Or, not elected, sat you judging—wine?

O.L. You jest; but I, poor soul, am misery-stung.

Chr. What kind of misery stings you? Tell me
    quick.

O.L. Then listen. I'd a lad that loved me well,
    Poor, but so handsome, and so fair to see,
    Quite virtuous too; whate'er I wished, he did
    In such a nice and gentlemanly way;
    And what he wanted, I in turn supplied.

Chr. What were the things he asked you to supply?

O.L. Not many: so prodigious the respect
    In which he held me. 'Twould be twenty drachmas
    To buy a cloak and, maybe, eight for shoes;
    Then for his sisters he would want a gown,
    And just one mantle for his mother's use,
    And twice twelve bushels of good wheat perchance.

Chr. Not many truly were the gifts he asked!
    'Tis plain he held you in immense respect.

O.L. And these he wanted not for greed, he swore,
    But for love's sake, that when my robe he wore,
    He might, by that, remember me the more.

Chr. A man prodigiously in love indeed!

O.L. Aye, but the scamp's quite other-minded
    now.
    He's altogether changed from what he was.
    So when I sent him this delicious cake,
    And all these bonbons here upon the tray,
    Adding a whispered message that I hoped
    To come at even—

Chr. Tell me what he did?

O.L. He sent them back, and sent this cream-cake
    too,
    Upon condition that I come no more;
    And said withal, "Long since, in war's alarms
    Were the Milesians lusty men-at-arms."

Chr. O, then the lad's not vicious; now he's rich
    He cares for broth no longer, though before,
    When he was poor, he snapped up anything.

O.L. O, by the Twain, and every day before,
    He used to come, a suppliant, to my door.

Chr. What, for your funeral?

O.L. No, he was but fain
    My voice to hear.

Chr. Your bounty to obtain.

O.L. When in the dumps, he'd smother me with
    love,
    Calling me "little duck" and "little dove."

Chr. And then begged something for a pair of
    shoes.

O.L. And if perchance, when riding in my coach
    At the Great Mysteries, some gallant threw
    A glance my way, he'd beat me black and blue,
    So very jealous had the young man grown.

Chr. Aye, aye, he liked to eat his cake alone.

O.L. He vowed my hands were passing fair and
    white.

Chr. With twenty drachmas in them—well he
    might.

O.L. And much he praised the fragrance of my
    skin.

Chr. No doubt, no doubt, if Thasian you poured
    in.

O.L. And then he swore my glance was soft and
    sweet.

Chr. He was no fool: he knew the way to eat
    The goodly substance of a fond old dame.

O.L. O then, my dear, the God is much to blame.
    He said he'd right the injured, every one.

Chr. What shall he do? Speak, and the thing is done.

O.L. He should, by Zeus, this graceless youth
    compel
    To recompense the love that loved him well;
    Or no good fortune on the lad should light.

Chr. Did he not then repay you every night?

O.L. He'd never leave me all my life, he said.

Chr. And rightly too; but now he counts you dead.

O.L. My dear, with love's fierce pangs I've pined
    away.

Chr. Nay rather, grown quite rotten, I should say.

O.L. O, you could draw me through a ring, I
    know.

Chr. A ring? A hoop that round a sieve could go.

O.L. O, here comes he of whom I've been com-
    plaining
    All this long while; this is that very lad!
    Bound to some revel surely.

Chr. So it seems.
    At least, he has got the chaplets and the torch.

*Enter Youth.*

Yo. Friends, I salute you.

O.L. Eh?

Yo. Mine ancient flame,
    How very suddenly you've got grey hair.

O.L. O me, the insults I am forced to bear.

Chr. 'Tis years since last he saw you, I dare say.

O.L. What years, you wretch? He saw me yester-
    day!

Chr. Why then, his case is different from the rest;
    When in his cups, methinks, he sees the best.

O.L. No, this is just his naughty, saucy way.

Yo. O Gods of eld! Poseidon of the Main!
    What countless wrinkles does her face contain!

O.L. O! O!
    Keep your torch off me, do.

Chr. In that she's right.
    For if one spark upon her skin should light,
    'Twould set her blazing, like a shrivelled wreath.

Yo. Come, shall we play together?

O.L. Where? For shame!

Yo. Here with some nuts.

O.L. And what's your little game?

Yo. How many teeth you've got.

Chr. How many teeth?
    I'll make a guess at that. She's three, no, four.

Yo. Pay up; you've lost: one grinder, and no
    more.

O.L. Wretch, are you crazy that you make your
    friend
    A washing-pot before so many men?

Yo. Were you well washed, 'twould do you good
    belike.

Chr. No, no, she's got up for the market now.
    But if her white-lead paint were washed away,
    Too plain you'd see the tatters of her face.

O.L. So old and saucy! Are you crazy too?

Yo. What, is he trying to corrupt you, love,
    Toying and fondling you when I'm not looking?

O.L. By Aphrodite, no, you villain you!

Chr. No, no, by Hecate, I'm not so daft.
    But come, my boy, I really can't allow you
    To hate the girl.

Yo. Hate her? I love her dearly.

Chr. Yet she complains of—

Yo. What?

Chr. Your flouts and jeers,
    Sending her word, "Long since, in war's alarms
    Were the Milesians lusty men-at-arms."

Yo. Well, I won't fight you for her sake.

Chr. How mean you?

Yo. For I respect your age, since be you sure
    It is not everybody I'd permit
    To take my girl. You, take her and begone.

Chr. I know, I know your drift; no longer now
    You'd keep her company.

O.L. Who'll permit that?

Yo. I won't have anything to do with one
    Who has been the sport of thirteen thousand—suns.

Chr. But, howsoever, as you drank the wine,
    You should, in justice, also drink the dregs.

Yo. Pheugh! They're such very old and fusty
    dregs!

Chr. Won't a dreg-strainer remedy all that?

Yo. Well, go ye in. I want to dedicate
    The wreaths I am wearing to this gracious God.

O.L. Aye then, I want to tell him something too.

Yo. Aye then, I'll not go in.

Chr. Come, don't be frightened.
    Why, she won't ravish you.

Yo. I'm glad to hear it.
    I've had enough of her in days gone by.

O.L. Come, go you on; I'll follow close behind.

Chr. O Zeus and King, the ancient woman sticks
    Tight as a limpet to her poor young man.

*They all enter the house, and the door is shut. Hermes enters, knocks, and hides himself. Cario opens the door, and sees no one; coming out, he carries a pot containing tripe and dirty water.*

Ca. Who's knocking at the door? Hallo, what's
    this!
    'Twas nobody it seems. The door shall smart,
    Making that row for nothing.

He. Hoi, you sir,
    Stop, Cario! Don't go in.

Ca. Hallo, you fellow,
    Was that you banging at the door so loudly?

He. No, I was going to when you flung it open.
    But run you in and call your master out,
    And then his wife, and then his little ones,
    And then the serving-men, and then the dog,
    And then yourself, and then the sow.

Ca. (severely) Now tell me
    What all this means.

He. It means that Zeus is going
    To mix you up, you rascal, in one dish,
    And hurl you all into the Deadman's Pit!

Ca. Now for this herald must the tongue be cut.
    But what's the reason that he is going to do us
    Such a bad turn?

He. Because ye have done the basest
    And worst of deeds. Since Wealth began to see,
    No laurel, meal-cake, victim, frankincense,
    Has any man on any altar laid
    Or aught beside.

Ca. Or ever will; for scant
    Your care for us in the evil days gone by.

He. And for the other Gods I'm less concerned,
    But I myself am smashed and ruined.

Ca. Good.

He. For until now the tavern-wives would bring
    From early dawn figs, honey, tipsy-cake,
    Titbits for Hermes, such as Hermes loved;
    But now I idly cross my legs and starve.

Ca. And rightly too, who, though such gifts you
    got,
    Would wrong the givers.

He. O, my hapless lot!
    O me, the Fourth-day cake in days gone by!

Ca. You want the absent; nought avails your
    cry.

He. O me, the gammon which was erst my fare!

Ca. Here play your game on bladders, in the air.

He. O me, the inwards which I ate so hot!

Ca. In your own inwards now a pain you've got.

He. O me, the tankard, brimmed with half and
    half!

Ca. Begone your quickest, taking this to quaff.

He. Will you not help a fellow-knave to live?

Ca. If anything you want is mine to give.

He. O, could you get me but one toothsome loaf,
    Or from the sacrifice you make within
    One slice of lusty meat?

Ca. No exports here.

He. O, whenso'er your master's goods you stole,
    'Twas I that caused you to escape detection.

Ca. Upon condition, ruffian, that you shared
    The spoils. A toothsome cake would go to you.

He. And then you ate it every bit yourself.

Ca. But you, remember, never shared the kicks
    Were I perchance detected at my tricks.

He. Well, don't bear malice, if you've Phyle got,
    But take me in to share your happy lot.

Ca. What, leave the Gods, and settle here below?

He. For things look better here than there, I
    trow.

Ca. Think you Desertion is a name so grand?

He. Where most I prosper, there's my fatherland.

Ca. How could we use you if we took you in?

He. Install me here, the Turn-god by the door.

Ca. The Turn-god? Turns and twists we want no
    more.

He. The God of Commerce?

Ca. Wealth we've got, nor need
    A petty-huckstering Hermes now to feed.

He. The God of Craft?

Ca. Craft? Quite the other way.
    Not craft, but Honesty, we need today.

He. The God of guidance?

Ca. Wealth can see, my boy!
    A guide no more 'tis needful to employ.

He. The God of games? Aha, I've caught you
    there.
    For Wealth is always highly sympathetic
    With literary games, and games athletic.

Ca. How lucky 'tis to have a lot of names!
    He has gained a living by that "God of games."
    Not without cause our Justices contrive
    Their names to enter in more lists than one.

He. Then on these terms I enter?

Ca. Aye, come in.
    And take these guts, and wash them at the well.
    And so, at once, be Hermes Ministrant.

*Exeunt Cario and Hermes.*
*Enter the Priest of Zeus Soter, to find Chremylus.*

Pr. O tell me, where may Chremylus be found?

Chr. (entering) What cheer, my worthy fellow?

Pr. What but ill?
    For ever since this Wealth began to see,
    I'm downright famished, I've got nought to eat,
    And that, although I'm Zeus the Saviour's priest.

Chr. O, by the Powers, and what's the cause of
    that?

Pr. No man will slay a victim now.

Chr. Why not?

Pr. Because they all are wealthy; yet before,
    When men had nothing, one, a merchant saved
    From voyage-perils, one, escaped from law,
    Would come and sacrifice; or else at home
    Perform his vows, and summon me, the priest.
    But not a soul comes now, or body either,
    Except a lot of chaps to do their needs.

Chr. Then don't you take your wonted toll of that?

Pr. So I've myself a mind to cut the service
    Of Zeus the Saviour now, and settle here.

Chr. Courage! God willing, all will yet be well.
    For Zeus the Saviour is himself within,
    Coming unasked.

Pr. O, excellent good news!

Chr. So we'll at once install—but bide awhile—
    Wealth in the place where he was erst installed,
    Guarding the Treasury in Athene's Temple.
    Hi! bring me lighted candles. Take them, you,
    And march before the God.

Pr. With all my heart.

Chr. Call Wealth out, somebody.

*Enter Old Lady from the house.*

O.L. And I?

Chr. O, you.
    Here, balance me these installation pots
    Upon your head, and march along in state.
    You've got your festive robes at all events.

O.L. But what I came for?

Chr. Everything is right.
    The lad you love shall visit you tonight.

O.L. O, if you pledge your honour that my boy
    Will come tonight, I'll bear the pots with joy.

Chr. These pots are not like other pots at all.
    In other pots the mother is atop,
    But here the mother's underneath the pot.

Ch. 'Tis the end of the Play, and we too must delay
    our departure no longer, but hasten away,
    And follow along at the rear of the throng,
    rejoicing and singing our festival song.
