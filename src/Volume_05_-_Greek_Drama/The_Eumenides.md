## Delphi. Before the Temple of Apollo.

**Prophetess**
Before all gods my punctual prayer prefers
Gaia, first Prophetess; Themis next her,
Who did succeed her Mother in this seat
Oracular, as some have told us; third
In order, by her free, unforced consent,
Sat here another Titaness, Chthon's child,
Phoebe; and she gave it a birthday gift,
To Phoebus, who took on him Phoebe's name.
From his still mere, his craggy Delian Isle,
On Pallas' shore, the port of ships, debarked,
Hither he came, to this Parnassian grot;
With fair conduct and worship and great laud
From Hephaestus' sons, that hewed his path, and made
The unreclaimed and savage region tame.
Rich honors had he here from the simple folk
And from Delphus, their prince and governor.
And Zeus possessed him of his mystery,
And planted him fourth seer upon this throne;
Prophet of Zeus is Loxias, Son of Sire.
These are the gods of prefatory prayer.
But Pronaia Pallas hath prime mention, too;
Their lauds the Nymphs of the Corycian Rock,
Hollow birds love, repair of Deities;
The wild is Bromius' chase, never forgot,
Since His Divinity captained the Bacchanals
And toiled King Pentheus like a mountain hare.
On Pleistus' Fountain and Poseidon's Force
I call, and highest Zeus, All-Perfecter,
Ere I go in and take my prophet-throne.
And now good hap all heretofore excelling
Wait on my going in, and every Greek,
By lot admitted and old custom-law.
I deal mine answers as the god me guides.

*She enters the Shrine but returns almost immediately.*

Horrors past speech, horrors I durst not look on,
Have driven me forth again from Loxias' House!
My limbs failed me; I could not stand upright;
On hands and knees I scrambled along the ground!
Fear makes us old wives naught, helpless as babes.
As I was passing toward the wreath-hung shrine
I saw a man right at the Nombril-Stone,
He did pollute, sit like a suppliant; blood
Dripped from his hands; he held a naked sword
And a high-branched and leafy olive bough,
With a great flock of wool all meekly tied;
A silvery fleece; of that I am very sure.
And over against the man a company
Of awesome women sound asleep on thrones;
And yet not women; rather Gorgon-shapes;
And yet not Gorgons neither by their mien.
I have seen pictures of She-things that snatched
At Phineus' feast; but these, methought, were all
Wingless and black and made my blood run cold.
They snored with blasts I dared not draw anigh,
And from their eyes let ooze an evil rheum;
Their garb no vestment for the marble gods
Nor fit to carry to the homes of men.
I never saw the kindred or the tribe
Of this strange fellowship, nor know the land
Could breed them and not sorrow for their birth.
Let this be looked to by great Loxias.
Prophet and leech and portent-reader, He;
In homes not His the Purgatorial Power.

*Exit.*

*The Temple-doors open, disclosing all that the Prophetess has described. Apollo stands over Orestes.*

**Apollo**
My word is passed: I never will forsake thee,
Thy guardian to the end, close at thy side,
And far away not tender to thy foes.
These ogreish maws are muzzled now, thou seest;
These cursed carlines cast into a sleep;
Old barreners, the early get of Time,
Ne'er clasped in love by god or man or brute.
For Evil's sake brought forth, since Evil came,
The Dark their pale, and Tartarus 'neath the world;
Fiends loathed of flesh and of Olympian gods.
Natheless, fly thou and never faint thy heart;
For they will drive thee over continents,
Treading for evermore the traveled earth,
And over the sea and cities far enisled.
Weary not ere thy warfare come; chew not
The cud of fearful phantasy: Get thee
To Pallas' Town; there clasp her statua,
And we will find thee Judges of thy cause,
And frame sooth speeches that shall work like charms
For evermore deliverance from thy sorrow.
I speak, that bade thee strike thy mother down.

**Orestes**
O Prince Apollo, Thou know'st to do right;
Let not thy lore, oblivious, lapse from use.
Thy puissance to effect is my sure bond.

**Apollo**
I charge thee, think on that: fail not from fear.

*He turns to the statue of Hermes.*

And thou, My blood-brother, My Father's Son,
Hermes, be Thou his Keeper; prove Thy Name,
Great Guide: be Pastor of my sheep that cries
To me; Zeus careth for the castaway,
With Thy fair escort sent among mankind.

*Exit Orestes. Apollo retires into the Sanctuary.*

## Enter the Ghost of Clytaemnestra.

**Ghost of Clytaemnestra**
Sleep then: Sleep on! And whereto serve your slumbers?
I only must endure your contumely
In death: the rebuke of my assassination
Clings to me yet among unbodied ghosts;
A vagabond, an outcast! Let me tell ye
They lay a sore indictment to my charge.
And for these fearful wrongs, mine own dealt me,
Not one of all the Invisible Powers is wroth,
Though mine own child lifted his hand against me!
Look at these wounds! Behold them with thy heart!
When the soul sleeps the inward eye is bright:
No glance of Fate is glimpsed in the waking day.
Times without number at my hand ye lapped
Your draughts not mixed with wine, abstemious cups;
Your solemn midnight suppers I have roast
At mine own hearth, when no god else is served.
And yet all this is trampled in the dust;
And he is fled, gone like a fleet-foot fawn,
As lightsome leapt the toils, and laughs full loud.
Give ear! For I have pled for soul, for life,
For being! Wake, Goddesses of the Deep!
A dream that once was Clytaemnestra calls.

*A noise of whining.*

Whimper and whine, but you have lost your man.
He hath his friends, and they are not like mine.

*Whining.*

Thou sleepst too sound; thou car'st not for my wrong;
Orestes that spilled his mother's blood flits free.

*Growling.*

Thou snarling slug-a-bed! Wilt not get up?
What hast thou done but evil since time was?

*Growling.*

Weariness and Sleep, the arch-conspirators,
Have stolen the fell Dragon's strength away!

*Two sharp howls.*

**A Fury** (still asleep)
There, there, there, there! Ware, hound!

**Ghost**
Thou hunt'st the hart in dream, and like a dog
That ne'er hath done, criest on the trail in sleep.
What would'st be at? Up, lest sloth master thee
And with its dull balm numb the nerve of pain.
Ache with that inward anguish thou dost owe,
The rankle of remorse, stern virtue's barb!
Let loose on him thy breath, that reeks hot blood!
Dry him up with smoke! Blast him with fire of thy belly!
Make this fault good and follow to his fall!

*She rushes out.*

**Chorus Leader**
Rouse all! Rouse her—and her! And I'll rouse thee!
Sleep'st? Get thee up! Shake off the shackling sleep!
Let's see if we have jeopardized our chase!

**First Fury**
Undone! Undone!
Oho! Oho!
We are shamed! We are shent!

**Second Fury**
I have hunted my woe!

**Third Fury**
Ah, sister, and I,
And all of our cry!
Balked, baffled and foiled;
We panted and toiled,
As hounds on the trail,
While the thicket he kept,
But the deer leaped the pale—

**Fourth Fury**
While I slumbered and slept!

**First Fury**
A thief and a knave
Art thou, Zeus' Son!

**Second Fury**
Our ancientry
Thy youth hath o'er-run!

**Third Fury**
The suitor finds grace
At thy hands this day!
The wicked one,
The matricide,
That Heaven defied,
Thou of Heaven's high race
Hast stolen away—

**Fourth Fury**
And was this well done?

**Chorus**
It is a knotless cord that cuts me most,
A phantom smart,
A charioteer of Dream, a chiding Ghost,
Hath wrung my heart!
I have been whipped; I stiffen at the stake,
A public show;
The hangman's knout hath stung me with dull ache,
Blow upon blow!
'Tis the new fashion, their just heritage
They count too small.
They must engross, these godlings come of age,
They will have all!
And we must see the world's great Nombril-Stone
Spout blood, aghast!
Polluting purples desecrate a throne,
Whose gules shall last!
Blind Seer! Himself infects His Holy Seat;
With obscene unction mires
His inmost Altar, whose hearth-embers heat
Prophetic fires.
Self-bidden, self-impelled,
Against Heaven's Law He hath rebelled,
A dying cause He honoreth
And immemorial Rights consigns to death!
He hath become abominable to me!
Nor shall to the end of Time
Cast loose whom He hath bound to Him, go free,
The Patron God of Crime!
Where one takes soil, a thousand cursed
Miscreants shall follow on the first,
Set their unholy feet upon his head,
Trampling His sanctuary with unquiet tread!

## Enter Apollo, with his bow and quiver of arrows.

**Apollo**
Out! I command you! Fast and faster yet!
Avoid My precincts! Quit Mine oracle!
Or take with ye a winged adder sheen,
Shot from My bow that's strung with golden wire,
And with the pang puke up black froth of men,
The retchy gobbets thou hast sucked from slaughter!
Ye do presume when ye come near My house;
Ye should be with chopped heads and gouged-out eyes,
Dooms, executions, maimed virilities,
Boy-eunuchs, mutilations, whittled trunks,
Stonings, deep groans and agonizing shrieks,
Spines spiked on iron pales! Now have ye heard
Your horrible regale, that makes gods hate ye,
Your dainty dish? Ay everything about ye
Betokens it. In some blood-bolting den
Of lions hutch and house; but rub not off
Your foul, infectious hides in my rich fane;
Go grisly goats! Get hence, unshepherded!
No son of Heaven would deign to pasture ye!

**Chorus**
Now listen to our answer, King Apollo!
Thou art—I say not the abettor of this—
But the sole Doer; Thou and only Thou.

**Apollo**
How, I beseech thee? So far thou may'st speak.

**Chorus**
Thou bad'st the guestling feigned do matricide.

**Apollo**
I bade him venge his father; what of that?

**Chorus**
Red-handed Thou receivedst the murderer.

**Apollo**
I charged him haste for cleansing to My house.

**Chorus**
And dost Thou rail at them that holp him hither?

**Apollo**
Ye are not fit to enter where I dwell.

**Chorus**
It is our bounden duty and our charge.

**Apollo**
What dignity is this? Cry me your worth!

**Chorus**
We harry mother-murderers from men's homes.

**Apollo**
What do ye to a wife that kills her husband?

**Chorus**
'Tis not so black as spilling kindred blood.

**Apollo**
Injurious hags, ye make of no account
High Hera's nuptial bond and Zeus' troth-plight:
Cypris the tenor of your pleading scoffs,
That gives to men the dearest joys flesh knows.
The marriage-bed a parcel is of Fate,
Hedged by a holier law than all oaths else.
If there be murder there, and thou relax,
Not punish, nor bend thither an angry brow,
I say, in law thou canst not ban Orestes.
For I perceive ye burn with zeal 'gainst him,
And show towards them a marvelous unconcern.
Not so the Goddess when she tries the cause.

**Chorus**
Not while Time lasts will I relinquish him.

**Apollo**
Pursue him then and multiply thy travail.

**Chorus**
Breathe no abridgement of my majesty.

**Apollo**
Nay, were it tendered me I'd none of it.

**Chorus**
Great art thou, ranked no lower than Zeus' chair.
Ha! I smell mother-blood! It leads me on
To vengeance: I will hunt the miscreant down!

*The Chorus rush out.*

**Apollo**
I will protect him, and draw him out of harm.
Dreaded of men and feared in Heaven is the wrath
Of him that sues for grace, if I forsake him.

*A year or perhaps longer passes: the scene changes to Athens and the Shrine of Pallas, whose image stands in front of the stage.*

## Enter Orestes, weary, with bleeding feet.

**Orestes**
Athena, Queen, by Loxias' command
I am here; be kind; receive a runagate,
But not a recreant with uncleansed hands.
My guilt grows dull, the edge of it worn down
On hearths not mine and the highways of the world.
Across wide continents, over the sea,
To Loxias' oracular command
Obedient, I am come unto Thy house,
Yea, to Thy holy Statua, Goddess,
Here will I harbor and abide Thy Doom.

*He crouches down and clasps the image.*

## Enter the Chorus.

**Chorus**
Aha, a palpable trace; we have him now!
Follow this close informer's mute record!
We are the hound and he is the hit fawn;
The blood's the trail, and we mark every drop.
Ha! I breathe hard, this helter-skelter heaves
My hollow flanks; we have quartered the whole earth,
Across the ocean warped our wingless way
Still close abeam, and never lost his sail.
Or here, or not far off he quaketh sore.
The smell of man's blood is laughter to my soul—
A winsome reek!
Go seek, go seek, go seek!
Search and sound
All this ground
Lest the vagabond we chase
Slip into safe hiding-place,
And for mother-murder done
Guilty son
Out of Law's reach scape scot-free.
There—there—there.
Yonder he sits!
See how he knits
His arms about Her image old
That breathes ambrosial air!
And doth Her succor make thee bold?
And do those hands implore
Her sentence? That shall never be!
Sorrow on thee!
The mother-blood those murderous hands have shed
Is irrecoverably fled!
The swallowing earth shall yield it nevermore!
Thy life for hers; thou shalt fill me a cup
Drawn from those veins of thine;
Deep draughts of jellied blood I will sip and sup,
Though bitter be the wine.
And then, when I have sucked thy life-blood dry,
I'll drag thee down below!
There mother's son shall mother's agony
Expiate, throe for throe!
And thou shalt see all damned souls, whilom
Sinners 'gainst god or guest
Or parent; and of each the righteous doom
Shall be by thee witnessed!
For Hades is a jealous Judge of Men,
And in His Black Assize
The record writ with ghostly pen
Cons with remorseless eyes.

**Orestes**
I am made perfect in the rule of Sorrow,
By oft occasions schooled know when to speak
And when refrain. But on this theme I am bid
By a most wise Preceptor ope my lips.
The blood from off this hand fades, fallen on sleep;
The spot of mother-murder is washed white;
That, when 'twas fresh, on Divine Phoebus' hearth
Was purged away with blood of slaughtered swine.
'Twere long to tell from that first hour all those
I have consorted with and harmed no man.
Now with pure lips that can no more offend
I ask Athena, Sovereign of this realm,
To be my helper. Hers are we then, not won
In war, myself, my Argos and her people,
By pact well-kept her feudatories for ever.
If she about the parts of Libya
Round Triton's rapid river, her natal stream,
Her foot advance, or veil with flowing train,
True friend of them she loves; or Phlegra's flats,
Like a bold cateran, lord of his clan, surveys,
Thence let her come—a god can hear from far—
And from this sore distress redeem my soul.

**Chorus**
Maugre Apollo and Athena's might
Thou goest to perdition, derelict
And damned; no place for joy in thy lost soul;
A calf bled white for fiends to munch, a shadow.
Answerest thou nothing? Art too sick with scorn,
My fatling, for my table sanctified;
My dish, not altar-slain but eaten alive?
Hear then the bitter spell that binds thee fast.
Come, dance and song, in linked round!
More deep than blithe Muse can
We'll make these groaning chanters sound
Our governance over Man!
No parley! Give us judgment swift!
We vex not in our wrath who spread
White hands to Heaven uplift.
Not unto such; he journeyeth
Unharmed, a happy traveler
Through life to the last pause of Death:
But to the froward soul, that seeks,
Like him, to cloak up, if he could,
Plague-spotted hands, with murder red,
To such our apparition speaks,
The faithful witness for the dead,
Plenipotentiary of Blood
And Slaughter's sovereign minister.
Hear me, my Mother! Hark,
Night, in whose womb I lay,
Born to punish dead souls in the dark
And the living souls in the day!
Lo, Leto's Lion-cub
My right denies;
He would take my slinking beast of the field,
Mine, mine by mother-murder sealed,
My lawful sacrifice.
But this is the song for the victim slain,
To blight his heart and blast his brain,
Wilder and wilder and whirl him along;
This is the song, the Furies' song,
Not sung to harp or lyre,
To bind men's souls in links of brass
And over their bodies to mutter and pass
A withering fire!
Long the thread Fate spun
And gave us to have and hold
For ever, through all Time's texture run,
Our portion from of old.
Who walks with murder shod,
With him walk we
On to the grave, the deep-dug pit;
And when he's dead, he shall have no whit
Too large a liberty!
Oh! this is the song for the victim slain,
To blight his heart and blast his brain,
Wilder and wilder and whirl him along!
This is the song, the Furies' song,
Not sung to harp or lyre,
To bind men's souls in links of brass
And over their bodies to mutter and pass
A withering fire!
When as yet we were quick in the womb,
This for our jointure was meted;
And the gods that know not Death's doom
Are not at our table seated;
With us they break no bread,
And of all their raiment shining,
I wear nor thrum nor thread;
I will have no fane for my shrining!
But when Quarrel comes in at the gate
For the crashing of homes, when Hate
Draweth his sword against kind,
Ho! who shall our fleet feet bind?
Though he putteth his trust in his strength,
The blood that is on him shall blind,
And our arm overtake him at length!
Grave cares of public trust claim we
With sudden, swift appearing;
Let hell's contention set heaven free,
Discharged without a hearing.
For all the Tribe that come
Dropping blood of kin, curse-ridden,
Zeus stoppeth their mouths; they are dumb,
To his high parle unbidden.
But when Quarrel comes in at the gate
For the crashing of homes, when Hate
Draweth his sword against kind,
Ho! who shall our fleet feet bind?
Though he putteth his trust in his strength,
The blood that is on him shall blind,
And our arm overtake him at length!
Glory of Man, to the azure day
Lifted in pomp, shall pass away,
Crumbled to ashes, a glory discrowned,
When we come, black Spirits sable-gowned,
Demon dancers, dour and dun,
That step to the tune of Malison!
A lusty leaper am I
And the feet of me shod with steel
Dint earth with doom from on high,
And the strong limbs quake and reel,
And the stride of the runner slackens full slow
When I trample him down to the night of woe!
He falleth and wotteth no whit of his fall,
Wildered and lost; so sick a pall
Like pestilence hangs o'er the soul that hath sinned;
And rumors wist, like a sobbing wind,
Loud in the land of his blindness tell
And the stately house whereon Darkness fell.
A lusty leaper am I,
And the feet of me shod with steel
Dint earth with doom from on high,
And the strong limbs quake and reel,
And the stride of the runner slackens full slow
When I trample him down to the night of woe!
Ay, Judgment may be stayed,
But it will come!
Skilled craftsmen are we at our trade,
Perfect in masterdom!
Yea, and therewith our memory is good
For all the evil under the sun;
To Man implacable, much wooed,
But hardly won!
Jealous of honors indefeasible,
Though by the gods held in despite and scorn,
Sundered from them by the great sink of Hell
And sunless gulfs forlorn,
Where who hath eyes, and who hath none
Grope in one twilight over screes and scars,
And evil are the ways and dusky set the stars.
What man that holds life dear
But bows the knee
In worship, yea, and shuddering fear,
Knowing that this must be?
By mine own lips admonished and advised
Of Power on Law's foundations laid,
To me by olden Destiny demised,
By gods conveyed
An absolute gift? I am the inheritress
Of Time, and hold my fief since Time has been
By very ancientry; not honored less,
Nor abject held and mean,
Though deep in ever-during shade
Under the sunny earth my mansion is,
And the thick Dark of the unlamped Abyss.

## Enter Athena.

**Athena**
I heard a voice calling me when I chanced
On far Scamander's side, to enfeoff me there
In my new land, the which the kings and captains
Achaean quartered me from their war-spoils,
Mine in eternal seisin absolute,
But set apart, a gift to Theseus' sons
Thence come I speeding not with way-worn foot,
Or wing, but rapt on aegis rustling wide
My harnessed colts high-couraged and my car.
And now this visitation, though I own
No touch of fear, presents a wonder to me.
In wonder's name who are ye? I say to all,
And to yon alien seated at mine image,
Your like I know not among things create,
Whether they be sights gazed on by the gods
Or aught in the similitude of man.
But to revile deformity offends
Good neighborhood and much revolts from justice.

**Chorus**
Daughter of Zeus, I will in brief inform thee.
We are Night's children gray and grim and old;
In Hell, our home, called maledictions dire.

**Athena**
This tells your title and your lineage.

**Chorus**
Thou art yet to know our state and our high charge.

**Athena**
Clearly expound and I shall quickly learn.

**Chorus**
Man-slayers we drive forth from the homes of men.

**Athena**
Where is the bound set for the slayer's feet?

**Chorus**
Where gladness is clean fallen out of fashion.

**Athena**
Is it in such wise ye beset yon man?

**Chorus**
Yea; he's deigned not to shed his mother's blood.

**Athena**
Under some strong constraint of menaced wrath?

**Chorus**
Where is the goad compels to mother-murder?

**Athena**
There be twain here, and I have heard but one.

**Chorus**
He is not to be bound, he will not take an oath.

**Athena**
Ye would seem just, yet work iniquity.

**Chorus**
How? Tell me that! Thou art not poor in wisdom.

**Athena**
Wrong shall not triumph here by force of oaths.

**Chorus**
Question him then and give a righteous judgment.

**Athena**
What? Would ye leave the issue in my hands?

**Chorus**
Yea, for Thine own worth and Thy worshipful Sire.

**Athena**
Sir, what hast thou to answer touching this?
Tell me thy land, thy lineage and all
Thy griefs; and then speak in thine own defense,
If that thou look'st for judgment; for that cause
Harborest at my hearth; all rites performed,
A grave appellant, like Ixion old.
Come, to all this make me your clear reply.

**Orestes**
Sovereign Athena, thou hast kept till last
A grave misgiving I shall first dispel.
I am no suppliant under ban; I come not
To clasp Thine image with polluted hands.
Proof mighty will I offer thereanent.
By law the blood-stained murderer must be mute
Till one with power to cleanse strike over him
The sacrificial blood of sucking swine.
Long since in homes not ours have we been purged
With all due rites, dumb beast and running stream.
Thus I resolve Thy doubt. By birth I am
Argive; my sire—'tis well thou askest me—
Was Agamemnon, Admiral of the sea,
With whom thou didst dispeople Ilium,
Yea, unstate Troy. Returned to his own house
Foully he fell, by my black-hearted mother
Cut down, ta'en, netted in the trammeling toils
That bare grim witness of his bloody bath.
I, then an exile, presently returned
And killed my mother—I deny it not—
In murderous revenge for my dear father.
And Loxias with me is answerable,
Who spoke of torments dire to goad my heart,
Except I dealt with them after their guilt.
Judge Thou if I have justly done or no:
Whate'er Thy doom, in Thee I rest content.

**Athena**
If any man think he can judge herein,
'Tis much too weighty; neither were it lawful
That I try murder, wreaked in bitter wrath.
And, namely, when thou com'st a sacrosanct
Suitor, aneled and hurtless to my house:
Preferred withal as guiltless to my realm;
While these hold powers not easily dismissed,
And if they triumph not in the event,
Poison of hurt pride will fall presently
And the land ail with age-long pestilence.
So stands it; whether they stay or I bid them hence
I shall find trouble and perplexity.
But, since so jump the business comes this way,
I will appoint a court for murder sworn
And make it a perpetual ordinance.
Call up your witnesses, bring in your proofs,
Justice's sworn helpers and oath-bounden aids.
The prime in worth I'll choose from out my sons
And come, and well and truly try the cause
By the unswerving tenor of their troth.

*Exit.*

**Chorus**
Now comes the crack of doom, by strong
Subversive stroke of rebel laws,
If he have room to plead his wrong,
And justice vindicate his cause,
Whose hands are stained with his mother's blood.
This knits all in one brotherhood,
The easy fellowship of crime.
And from this instance loom in long array
Blood-boltered parents whom their sons shall slay
Down the dark glimpses of disordered Time.
And we that wont to watch mankind,
That thirst for cups incarnadined,
No more our anger shall unleash:
I'll give Death leave to slay all flesh.
And each shall prophesy his own
Doom from his neighbor's fate foreknown;
All comers then from the world's ends
They shall accost in search of some relief;
And learn from ashy lips and looks of grief
Such feeble physic as despair commends.
Who reeleth then from the fatal blow
Let him look not for redress,
Nor bootless clamor "Justice, Ho!
Ho, the Throned Erinyes!"
Fathers, mothers, let your loud
Death-wound shriek shrill through your halls;
For a mightier frame is bowed;
Yea, the House of Justice falls.
There is a place for Fear; she tries
The reins, a warder weariless;
And it is well with tears and sighs
To follow after Soothfastness.
What man, what power through the wide earth,
Whose soul is not with child of Fear
Nor tends her as a blessed birth,
Can be of Law true worshipper?
Let not thy heart commend
Life without Law, nor lend
Thy fulsome breath to fan a tyrant's lust;
God doth to power advance,
Though His wise governance
Change with the shifting forms of things, the comely
Mean and just.
Hark, how my graver rhyme
To that just Mean keeps time:
From Godlessness springs Pride, the Prodigal;
But he that doth possess
Soul's health hath Happiness,
The child of many prayers, the best beloved of all.
Lay to thy heart this law,
O Man; stand thou in awe
Of Justice' Altar; not for any lure
Or glitter of false gain
Plant there thy foot profane
To tread it in the dust, for chastisement is sure.
The deed is done, but thence
Ensues the consequence,
That crowns, completes, the master-stroke of all;
Honor, ye sons of men,
Your parents first, and then
The guest that goeth in and out, the stranger in your hall.
So virtuous as I would have thee be,
Self-taught, by no compulsion overborne,
Thou canst not wholly miss Felicity,
Nor ever founder, utterly forlorn.
But this I say: who venturously puts forth
And every law of Righteousness outbraves,
His trash, his traffic, got 'neath evil stars,
In the dread Day of Wrath,
He shall commit to the devouring waves,
When splits the sail and splintered are the spars.
Then at deaf ears his cry unheard shall knock,
Swooning in gulfs where none to land may win;
Unearthly laughter shall his summons mock
Whose soul is fuel for the fires of Sin.
He boasted he would never see that day,
But now his Angel sees him weak and spent,
Powerless to top those seas; and, all his teen
And travail cast away,
On the uncharted reef of Justice rent,
He sinks with none to wail him and is no more seen.

## The Areopagus.

**Athena**
Make proclamation, herald; keep the press back,
And let the braying trump Tyrrhenian
That's heard in Heaven, filled with thy man's breath,
Sound in the public ear a mighty parle.

For while the synod fills my Judgment Hall
    There must be silence; so shall the whole realm
    Learn my commandments everlastingly,
    And these, my chosen, that they judge aright.

*Enter Apollo.*

**Ch.** Apollo! King! O'er what is Thine bear rule!
    Say, wherefore art Thou come to meddle here?

**Ap.** First I am come to testify; for ye
    Have here a suitor and a suppliant
    Of mine; his blood-guilt I did purge and cleanse.
    Next, I am in the bill, myself arraigned
    For this man’s mother’s murder.
    (To Athena) Call the case;
    And, as thou knowest how, maintain the Right.

**At.** (To the Furies) The word's with you; the
    trial may proceed;
    And ’tis sound law and justice both, that he
    Who doth prefer the charge shall first begin.

**Ch.** Though we be many, we shall use few words.
    Do thou make answer as I question thee.
    And tell us first if thou didst slay thy mother.

**Or.** Yea, I make no denial; I killed her.

**Ch.** So, in this thrice-encounter one round ends.

**Or.** Ye have not thrown your man, ye crow too
    soon.

591-643

    No matter; how was’t thou didst take her
    life?

**Or.** I answer—with my sword; I cut her throat.

**Ch.** By whom seduced? Whose ill admonishment?

**Or.** At His behest: Himself is witness for me.

**Ch.** The Prophet bade thee murder thine own
    mother?

**Or.** Even so; and to this hour I rue it not.

**Ch.** Not? But a pebble-cast may change thy tune.

**Or.** I have my faith; my sire sends help from his
    grave.

**Ch.** What! Kill thy mother and put trust in ghosts!

**Or.** She was aspersed with two-fold villainy.

**Ch.** How can that be? I charge thee, tell the
    court.

**Or.** She slew her husband and struck down my
    father.

**Ch.** Thou liv’st; but she is quit by her bloody
    death.

**Or.** Why did ye not hunt her while yet she lived?

**Ch.** She was not of one blood with him she slew.

**Or.** Am I accounted of my mother’s blood?

**Ch.** Thou gory villain, was not thy body framed,
    Fed in her womb? Wilt thou deny thy mother?

**Or.** Do Thou bear witness for me now, pronounce
    Apollo, if I slew her with just cause;
    For that ’twas done I have and do confess;
    But whether justly done or no, do Thou
    Give sentence, that the court may hear me plead.

**Ap.** To you, Athena’s great Consistory,
    Justly I’ll speak, and, withal, truthfully,
    For that I am a prophet and lie not.
    My throne of Divination never yet
    To man nor woman, no, nor polity,
    Delivered aught, but I was bidden speak
    By Zeus, the Father of the Olympian Gods.
    Weigh well the force of that, ye Councillors,
    And then ensue the thing my Father wills:
    For Zeus is of more might than all oaths else.

**Ch.** Zeus, then, thou say’st, delivered the oracle
    That bade Orestes venge his father’s death
    And reckon not the cost of a mother’s life?

**Ap.** Far other was the murder of a man
    Noble, by God-given sceptre high exalted,
    At the hands of a woman, not with valiant
    Arrows far sped by archer Amazon,
    But in such wise as thou shalt hear, Pallas,
    And you, upon whose vote the verdict hangs.
    When from war’s business prosperous in the main
    He was returned, she gave him loving welcome.
    He took his bath, and, when his bath was done,
    She wrapped him in a cloak, a sleeveless robe,
    And in its shackling mazes hewed him down.
    This was the manner of his taking off,
    The majesty of the world, the lord of ships;
    And such was she; oh, lay it to your hearts,
    Ye judges, that are set to try the cause.

**Ch.** Zeus, thou pretendest, holds a father’s life
    Precious exceedingly; and yet Himself
    Cast his own Father Cronos into chains!
    Why, is not this confounding contraries?
    Mark well his argument, I conjure you!

EUMENIDES

644-699

**Ap.** You worse than beasts! You hag-seed, God abhorred!
    Bonds He may loose, for durance find a balm,
    And work, howso He please, deliverance.
    But when the dust hath drunk the blood of man
    And he’s once dead, there’s no uprising; spell
    For that my Father hath created not;
    Though, saving only this, the frame of things
    Is as a wheel He can revolve at will
    And, nothing scant of breath, turn upside-down.

**Ch.** A sorry plea, look you, to save your man!
    Shall he that spilt his mother’s, his own, blood
    Live here in Argos, in his father’s house?
    What public altars, think you, will he use?
    Who will admit him to the Holy Stoup?

**Ap.** Listen, and thou shalt own my deeper lore.
    To be called mother is in no wise to be
    Parent, but rather nurse of seed new-sown.
    The male begets: she’s host to her small guest;
    Preserves the plant, except it please God blight it.
    I’ll furnish reasons for my argument.
    There hath been and there can be fatherhood
    Though there should be no mother; witness here
    Olympian Zeus’ own self-created child,
    That grew not in the womb’s dark coverture;
    A branch so goodly never Goddess bore.
    Pallas, as it hath ever been my care
    To make thy city great, famous thine arms,
    I have sent thee this suitor on thy hearth,
    That he may be Thy true man evermore,
    And Thou, Goddess, may’st count him Thine ally
    And all his seed; and to remotest age
    These men’s sons may keep Thy covenant.

**At.** Shall I direct them now to cast their votes,
    As conscience dictates? Hath enough been said?

**Ch.** We have shot every arrow from our bow;
    Nothing remains but to abide the event.

**At.** Surely. (To Apollo and Orestes) And how
    shall I do right by you?

**Ap.** Ye have heard what ye have heard: think
    on your oaths;
    Carry to the urn the verdict of your hearts.

**At.** Ye men of Athens, hear my law; ye judges
    That try this cause, the first for man’s blood shed.
    Henceforth to Aegeus' congregated host
    This Court shall be an ordinance for ever;
    This Hill of Ares, once a place of arms
    Where leaguering Amazons pitched their tents,
    what time
    They warred with Theseus and their jealous towers
    New-raised against our sovran citadel;
    And sacrificed to Ares, whence the Rock
    Is called the Rock Areopagus. There shall Awe,
    With civil Fear, her kinsman, night and day
    Perpetual sessions hold to punish wrong,
    If that my sons depart not from my law.
    For, an thou foul the spring with flood or mire,
    The fresh and sparkling cup thou'lt find no more.
    Nor anarchy nor arbitrary power
    Would I have Athens worship or uphold,
    Nor utterly banish Fear from civic life.
    For who is virtuous except he fear?

88

699-753

    This seat of Awe kept ever formidable
    Shall be a wall, a bulwark of salvation,
    Wide as your land, as your imperial state;
    None mightier in the habitable world
    From Scythia to the parts of the Peloponnese.
    A Place of Judgment incorruptible,
    Compassionate, yet quick in wrath, to wake
    And watch while Athens sleeps I stablish here.
    My large discourse these precepts would commend
    To my sons yet unborn. Rise from your seats;
    Take up your counters and upon your oaths
    Return a righteous verdict. I have done.

*The Judges cast their votes during the ensuing
dialogue.*

**Ch.** Take heed, we are ungentle visitors;
    Learn of our wisdom and misprise us not.

**Ap.** My words that are God's Voice hold ye in awe;
    Make them not as blind plants that bear no fruit.

**Ch.** Thou hallowest deeds of blood that are not
    Thine,
    And shalt no more prophesy holy things.

**Ap.** Faileth the Father's Wisdom, for that He
    Sheltered Ixion, the first murderer?

**Ch.** Thou sayest; but, if I am baulked of justice,
    I’ll vex this land and visit it in wrath.

**Ap.** The younger Gods regard thee not; the old
    Pay thee no honour; victory is mine.

**Ch.** So didst thou sometime deal in Pheres' house;
    Tempting the Fates to make mankind immortal.

**Ap.** Is it not just to help a worshipper,
    And doubly, trebly just in the day of need?

**Ch.** Thou didst break down earth's parcelled
    governance,
    With new wine practise on the Goddesses old.

**Ap.** Nay, when the cause is lost, thy venom void;
    It hath no power to hurt thine adversaries.

**Ch.** Since Thy hot youth o'er-rides our ancientry
    I wait on judgment; doubtful yet to launch
    My indignation ’gainst the State of Athens.

**At.** It shall be mine, if judgment hang in poise,
    To cast this counter that Orestes live.
    Mother is none that gave my Godhead life;
    I am the male's; saving my never-wed
    Virginity, my Father’s child thrice o’er.
    Therefore I rate not high a woman’s death
    That slew her lord, the master of her house.
    Orestes wins, yea, though the votes be paired.
    Come, Sirs, despatch; ye whose the office is
    To make an end, empty me out the urns.

**Or.** Phoebus Apollo, how will judgment go?

**Ch.** Swart Night, my Mother, watchest Thou
    unseen?

**Or.** I near mine end, the halter or the day!

**Ch.** We fall, or have great glory evermore!

**Ap.** Sirs, count the votes; make strictest scrutiny,
    With holy fear, lest Judgment go awry.
    A vote o'er-looked may work most grievous wrong:
    A single pebble save a tottering house.

*A pause.*

**At.** The accused is found “not guilty” of the
    charge;
    The tellers certify an equal count.

AESCHYLUS

754-810

**Or.** O Pallas! O Preserver of my race!
    To my lost realm my father once possessed
    Thou hast restored me! Now shall all Greece say,
    “True Son of Argos, lord of his father’s substance,
    He dwelleth with his own.” Pallas wrought this
    And Loxias and the Almighty Third,
    The Saviour. Moved by my sire's fate, He saw,
    And saved from them that pled my mother’s cause.
    Now ere I go to mine own house I swear
    Unto Thy land and all Thy host an oath
    Succeeding ages shall fulfill: no prince
    Of earth shall carry here the barbed spear.
    When we are in our graves we will confound
    Who break this oath with sorry misadventure;
    Their ways be weariness, their paths forbid,
    And for their rapine they shall reap but ruth.
    But if they shall keep faith, gird them with might
    For Pallas’ city, we will show them grace.
    Goddess, farewell; be matchless still in arms,
    Find still a valiant people strong to throw
    All who rise up against Thee; keep Thee safe
    And with their sword win for Thee victory!

*Exit.*

**Ch.** Oh, ye young Gods! Ye have ridden the old
    laws down, ye have reft
    My prey, and I am left
    Dishonoured and undone!
    But for these pangs
    Athens shall have my malison!
    Ay, on these lips there hangs
    (Ho, Vengeance, soon to shed)
    A venomed drop of my heart's agony!
    And it shall multiply and spread,
    Bitter and barren! It shall be
    A mildew and a leprosy,
    A canker to the leafless tree,
    A curse to the childless bed;
    On everything that hath breath
    Corrosion, purulence and death!
    Wail—and wail—and wail?
    Or witch them? Shadowing their land with bale?
    Transmute to unimaginable woe
    Grief insupportable? Oho,
    Ye Virgin Daughters to black Midnight born,
    How sharp your sorrow! How is your honour shorn!

**At.** Nay, take it not with such a heavy heart;
    Ye are not vanquished; equal are the votes
    In simple truth, not thy disparagement.
    Oh, here were proofs radiant with God's own light!
    And He that gave the oracle bare witness
    Orestes should not suffer for his deed.
    Let not your heavy wrath light on this ground;
    Consider, be not angry, shed no drops
    To blast the fruitful earth with barrenness
    And with keen tooth devour the pregnant seed.
    I will provide you, pledge hereto my oath,
    A hold, a hollow in this righteous land,
    Altars and shining thrones where ye shall sit,
    And worship and great honour from her sons.

**Ch.** Oh, ye young Gods! Ye have ridden the old
    laws down, ye have reft
    My prey, and I am left
    Dishonoured and undone!
    But for these pangs
    Athens shall have my malison!
    Ay, on these lips there hangs,
    (Ho, Vengeance, soon to shed)
    A venomed drop of my heart's agony!
    And it shall multiply and spread
    Bitter and barren; it shall be
    A mildew and a leprosy,
    A canker to the leafless tree,
    A curse to the childless bed;
    On everything that hath breath
    Corrosion, purulence and death!
    Wail—and wail—and wail?
    Or witch them? Shadowing their land with bale?
    Transmute to unimaginable woe
    Grief insupportable? Oho,
    Ye Virgin Daughters to black Midnight born,
    How sharp your sorrow! How is your honour shorn!

**At.** Your honour is safe; are ye not Goddesses?
    Curse not this soil that giveth life to man.
    I too have faith in Zeus; but why waste words?
    I only know the keys of the arsenal
    Of Heaven, stored with the sealed thunderbolt.
    But we shall need no thunder. Listen to me;
    Vent no wild words in sour despite, to make
    All that yields increase utterly miscarry.
    This dark wave's bitter fury put to sleep.
    Be what ye are, majestic, denizens
    With me in this fair land; prime offerings
    Shall then be yours through all her borders wide
    For children and the sacred marriage rite
    For evermore, and ye shall bless my words.

**Ch.** Oho! Am I to take these buffets, I
    To have my elder wisdom scoffed at, be
    Bid to my place, to house with infamy
    Here on this plot, this patch, this ell of earth?
    Blast it, my fury! Pain, pain, pain,
    Here at my heart—whence comes it? Why
    Am I to suffer? Darkness, Death and Dearth!
    Night, Mother Night, shall my wroth heart be hot
    And wilt thou hearken not?
    Strong craft of subtle Gods hath reft my ancient
    majesty!

**At.** I will be patient with thy passioning;
    Thou art mine elder, wiser than I.
    Yet Zeus hath not denied me understanding.
    Find out a new race, other soil; yet here
    Your heart will be; I speak this for your warning.
    The tide of Time shall for my people roll
    With ever-mantling glory: thou shalt have
    Thy mansion here hard by Erechtheus' house,
    And men and women come with frequent pomp
    And greater laud than the wide world can give.
    But in my borders bring no grindery
    To whet sharp daggers, in the breast of Youth
    Bloody and dangerous; with more madness edged
    Than works with wicked ferment in new wine.
    Nor take, as 'twere, the gamecock's heart, to plant
    Domestic Havoc here that fights with kind.
    Without their gates let my sons go to war,
    And who loves honour shall have all he craves.

EUMENIDES

866-921

    Your bantam-bully, ruffler of the yard,
    Arrideth me not, and I will none of him.
    Take thou thy choice and take it from my hand;
    Fair service, fair content, fair recompense,
    A portion in this realm the Gods love most.

**Ch.** Oho! Am I to take these buffets, I
    To have mine elder wisdom scoffed at, be
    Bid to my place, to house with Infamy
    Here on this plot, this patch, this ell of earth!
    Blast it, my fury! Pain, pain, pain,
    Here at my heart! Whence comes it? Why
    Am I to suffer? Darkness, Death and Dearth!
    Night, Mother Night, shall my wroth heart be hot
    And wilt thou hearken not?
    Strong craft of subtle gods hath reft my ancient
    majesty.

**At.** Still will I bless, thou shalt not weary me,
    Nor say my nonage set thy years at nought,
    Nor churlish men scorned thy Divinity
    And drave thee from their gates discomfited.
    If thou hold sacred the sweet Soul of Reason,
    If there be any virtue, any balm,
    Upon these lips, thou wilt remain. If not,
    Though thou should'st cast all anger in the scale
    To sink the land, all malice, all despite,
    It is not justly done. Justice gives thee
    A realm to share, a rich inheritance,
    And nothing of thine honour takes away.

**Ch.** Athena Queen, what mansion wilt Thou
    give me?

**At.** One where Grief cometh not; accept it thou.

**Ch.** An if I do, what honour shall I have?

**At.** This that no home shall prosper without thee.

**Ch.** But hast Thou power to make thy promise
    good?

**At.** We will establish him that worships thee.

**Ch.** Wilt Thou assure me this for evermore?

**At.** I promise not except I can perform.

**Ch.** Methinks, Thy magic works; I am no more
    wroth.

**At.** Possess the land and thou shalt win its love.

**Ch.** What shall I sing that hath a blessing in it?

**At.** A song to celebrate a cause well won.
    From the sweet earth, from the sea-dews and damps,
    From skies and winds ask inspirations, airs
    That travel on over a sunlit land;
    Fruit from the ground, and increase of strong cattle
    For all my sons, that Time can never tire;
    And saving Health for seed of human kind.
    Natheless, on Virtue chiefly shed thy balm;
    Like a wise gardener of the Soul, I hold
    There is no graft nor bud blooms half so fair;
    And this is thine; but thou shalt leave to me
    Glory of battle, where the cause is just,
    Death, but death garlanded with victory;
    And grudge if I be found herein remiss.

**Ch.** Pallas' home contenteth me;
    Honour to the strong city
    Zeus Almighty made His own
    And Ares' armed strength sustains;
    A fortress for the Gods of Greece,
    A jewel flashing forth anew,

927-977

    When ravished were her costly fanes
    And her high altars overthrown.
    Breathe on her blessings, breathe the dew
    Of prayer; Earth yield her thine increase;
    Shine, thou rejoicing Sun, and speed
    All nature sends and mortals need!

**At.** Not that I cherish Athens less,
    But that I love her well, have I
    Throned in her midst Great Goddesses,
    Spirits hard to pacify.
    All that makes up Man's moving story
    Is theirs to govern and dispense;
    He whom their hard hand ne'er made sorry,
    Who hath not met them on his way,
    Walking in blindness knows not whence
    The shock that beats him to his knees.
    The sin of some forgotten day
    Delivers up his soul to these.
    Destruction, like a voiceless ghost,
    Silenceth all his empty boast
    And minisheth his glory.

**Ch.** I will have nor storm nor flood
    Scathe her vines and olive-bowers;
    No scorching wind shall blind the bud
    In the waking-time of flowers.
    By my grace all airs that blow
    Their appointed bounds shall know.
    No distemper blast her clime
    With perpetual barrenness;
    Flocks and herds in yeaning time
    Pan shall with twin offspring bless;
    And Earth's wombed wealth, God-sealed,
    All its lucky ingots yield.

**At.** Warders of Athens, have ye heard
    Her voice? Know ye what these things mean?
    Wist ye how mighty is the word
    Erinys spake, the Queen?
    Mighty 'mid deathless Gods her crying
    'Mid Powers that Hell's hid glooms invest,
    And in this world of living, dying
    Mighty and manifest!
    She biddeth one make melody,
    And one down dark ways leadeth She,
    Blinded with tears undrying.

**Ch.** Untoward and untimely Doom
    Bring not strong Youth to his death-bed:
    Ye maidens, in your beauty bloom,
    Live not unloved, nor die unwed.
    You Heavenly Pair, this good gift grant.
    Grant it, ye Elder Destinies,
    Our Sisters, whom one Mother bare,
    Spirits whose governance is law,
    Of every home participant,
    And at all seasons, foul or fair,
    Just Inmates, Righteous Presences,
    Shadows of an Unseen Awe;
    Over the wide earth and the deep seas
    Honoured above all Deities.

**At.** Oh, bounty dealt with loving hand!
    It needs must fill my heart with glee,
    Such largesse lavished on my land.
    Wise Spirit, thanks to thee,

978-1006

    Spirit of Counsel, suave and holy,
    Whose sober eye could lead me on
    Till, though the stubborn will yield slowly,
    Yet their wild hearts were won!
    But Zeus, the Lord of Civic Life,
    Gave victory; in this noble strife
    He made Good triumph solely.

**Ch.** Tiger-throated Faction fed
    On the meat of human woe,
    Filled but never surfeited,
    Come not hither growling low,
    Nor wake Athens with thy roar.
    Never be this thirsty ground
    Drunk with fratricidal blood,
    Nor lust of Power insatiate
    Snatch at vengeance evermore.
    In one fellowship of Good
    Each be to his neighbour bound,
    One in love and one in hate;
    For such grace, where'er 'tis found,
    Lays the balm to many a wound.

**At.** Are they not wise? Speaks she not fair?
    Her tongue of gold makes counsel sweet
    And points the happy highway where
    Soft words and Wisdom meet.
    Mine eyes see visions; fair foundations
    Rise round these forms with fury fraught!
    Serve them! Bring them your rich oblations,
    And ye serve not for nought.
    Bless them, and they will surely bless;
    At home the reign of Righteousness,
    Renown throughout all nations.

**Ch.** Joy to you, joy and all good things!
    Joy to the fortunate city that lies
    With Zeus about her and above;
    Vowed to the Unmarried Maiden's love
    And in the dawn of Time made wise,
    Whom Pallas covers with her wings
    And the Father sanctifies!

**At.** Joy to you too in amplest store!
    But it is time; I go before;
    I lead you on your road;
    And by your escort's holy light
    Conduct you through the Shades of Night
    Down to your dark Abode.
    Set forward then your priestly train;
    Speed them with blood of victims slain
    Under this holy ground;
    Bind whatsoever bringeth death,
    And whatsoever profiteth
    Be by your spell unbound.
    As ye help Athens by your charms
    She shall be great in arts and arms,
    Still, still with victory crowned!
    Lead on, ye sons of Cranaos;
    For those that make their home with us
    A path and passage find;
    And by their good gifts freely given,
    By these sweet charities of Heaven
    Be all men of one mind!

1007-1047

**Ch.** Joy, joy to Athens! Oh, twice blest
    Be all that in her borders dwell,
    Or be they men of mortal mould
    Or deathless Deities that hold
    Pallas' rock-built citadel!
    Love me that am your Sacred Guest
    And bid to Grief a long farewell!

**At.** Take all my thanks; my heart goes with
    your prayers.
    Myself will lead you by the torches' blaze
    Down to your habitation 'neath the earth
    With these my ministrants round my statue
    On duteous watch; the apple of the eye
    Of Theseus' land, a famous company
    Of little ones and wives and beldams old.
    We'll mantle them in cloaks of scarlet fine.
    And all about them shake the bright fireshine,
    Give these New Dwellers noble welcoming
    That goodly men from their goodwill may spring.

*Escort.* Pass on your way, ye mighty,
    Ye Jealous in honour pass on,
    Children of Night unbegotten,
    Seed of her womb unsown,
    With pomp and triumph and holy mirth,
    (Hush! Good words, all ye people!)
    And prayer and sacrifice descend
    Down to the dark, diluvial earth.
    (Hush! Good words, all ye people!)
    Come, ye Majestic Spirits, come,
    Bring good luck to your new-found home
    By the glad bright light of the burning brand!
    (Cry, cry aloud with jubilee!)
    Peace to thee and peace to thee
    And peace for ever in Pallas' land!
    Partnered with happy Destiny
    All-seeing Zeus hath wrought to this end!
    (Cry, cry aloud with jubilee!)

*Exeunt.*

# THE PLAYS OF SOPHOCLES

## BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

Sophocles, *c*. 495-406 B.C.

Sophocles was born at Colonus in Attica around
495 B.C. His father, Sophillus, was a maker of munitions. That Sophillus himself worked as a smith or
carpenter, as has sometimes been said, seems unlikely, in view of his son’s social position and civic offices. According to Pliny, Sophocles was born in the
highest station. This tradition gains support from
the story that at the age of fifteen or sixteen he led
the Boys’ Chorus, which celebrated with song and
the music of the lyre the victory of Salamis.

As a schoolboy Sophocles was already famous for
his beauty and won prizes in athletics and in literature. He was taught music by Lamprus, whom Plutarch praised for sobriety and preferred to the more
impassioned and “realistic” Timotheus, who influenced Euripides in his later choruses.

From the ancient *Life*, which is probably of Alexandrian origin, and from references in other authors
it is evident that Sophocles both as poet and as
citizen played a prominent and varied role in the
life of Athens. His own life was coextensive with
the rise and fall of the city. Between his birth a few
years before Marathon and his death on the eve of
the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, the
greatest events of Athenian history took place. During that time Sophocles wrote and produced over
one hundred and twenty plays. In 443, as president
of the imperial treasury, he was in charge of collecting the tribute of the allies. In 440 he was elected
general and served with Pericles in the Samian War.
He went on embassies, and he was probably the
Sophocles referred to by Aristotle in the *Rhetoric* as
one of the ten elders chosen to manage the affairs
of the city after the Sicilian disaster. He was a friend
of Cimon and a member of his social circle, which
included such distinguished foreigners as Ion of
Chios, the tragic poet, and the painter, Polygnotus.
Among other friends of Sophocles were Archelaus
and Herodotus, to whom he wrote elegiac
poems.

Plutarch, in his *Life of Cimon*, says that Sophocles
won his first victory with the first play he produced.
His first victory came in 468 when he defeated Aeschylus with the *Triptolemus*, which is now lost. He
was thus twenty-seven when he began his public

dramatic career. In the remaining sixty-two years
of his life he wrote on an average two plays a year
and competed for the tragic prize thirty-one times.
He won at least eighteen victories and was never
placed third.

Of the seven plays that survive, the *Ajax* is probably the earliest. The *Antigone* belongs to 443 or
441. The chronological order of the *Trachiniae* and
the *Oedipus the King* is uncertain, the *Electra* is later,
and all three are assigned to the years between 435
and 410. The *Philoctetes* is known to have been produced in 408 when Sophocles was eighty-seven years
old. The *Oedipus at Colonus*, according to the story
made famous by the *De Senectute* of Cicero, was
Sophocles’ last play. Sophocles is supposed to have
been accused by his son of being unable to manage
his property, and to have convinced his judges of
his competence by reciting a chorus from this play,
which he had just completed.

Aristotle says in the *Poetics* that Sophocles raised
the number of actors to three and added scene-painting. Sophocles is also said to have written his
plays with certain actors in mind and not to have
acted in them himself because of the weakness of his
voice. That he was interested in the theory as well
as the practice of dramatic art is evident from his
having written a book “on the chorus,” and having
formed a “company of the educated” in honor of
the Muses. “Chorus” was the official name for tragedy, and a book on the chorus would have dealt,
presumably, with all aspects of the tragic poet’s art.
The “company of the educated” was probably a
society of cultivated Athenians who met to discuss
poetry and music, though it has also been suggested
that its members were actors who had been trained
by Sophocles.

Sophocles died in 406 B.C., as we know from the
*Frogs* of Aristophanes, brought out in the following
year. His epitaph, attributed to Simmias, the friend
of Socrates, honors his learning and wisdom and
calls him “the favorite of the Graces and the Muses.”
While Aeschylus and Euripides visited the courts of
foreign kings and died abroad, Sophocles never left
home, except in the service of the city, and died
where he had lived, in Athens.
