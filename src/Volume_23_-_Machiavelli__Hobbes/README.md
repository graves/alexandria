# Volume 23 - Machiavelli, Hobbes

Two foundational works of modern political thought, exploring the nature of power, sovereignty, and the state.

## NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI (1469-1527)

Florentine diplomat and political philosopher, Machiavelli is the father of modern political science, analyzing politics in terms of power rather than morality.

- **The Prince** - A handbook of statecraft addressed to Lorenzo de' Medici, offering ruthlessly pragmatic advice on acquiring and maintaining political power. Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be prepared to act immorally when necessity demands, famously exploring whether it is better to be loved or feared.

## THOMAS HOBBES (1588-1679)

English philosopher who developed a comprehensive materialist philosophy and a systematic theory of political absolutism.

- **Leviathan** - A masterwork of political philosophy arguing that human beings, driven by self-interest in a dangerous "state of nature," rationally consent to absolute sovereign authority for the sake of peace and security. Hobbes constructs a mechanistic theory of human nature and derives from it the necessity of an all-powerful commonwealth.
