## ACT I

### Scene i. Britain: the garden of Cymbeline's palace

*Enter two gentlemen.*

**1st Gent.** You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the King.

**2nd Gent.** But what’s the matter?

**1st Gent.** His daughter, and the heir of’s kingdom, whom
He purposed to his wife’s sole son—a widow
That late he married—hath referred herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded;
Her husband banished; she imprisoned. All
Is outward sorrow; though I think the King
Be touched at very heart.

**2nd Gent.** None but the King?

**1st Gent.** He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at.

**2nd Gent.** And why so?

**1st Gent.** He that hath missed the Princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report. And he that hath her—
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
And therefore banished—is a creature such
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like, there would be something failing
In him that should compare. I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.

**2nd Gent.** You speak him far.

**1st Gent.** I do extend him, sir, within himself,
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly.

**2nd Gent.** What’s his name and birth?

**1st Gent.** I cannot delve him to the root. His father
Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
He served with glory and admired success,
So gained the sur-addition Leonatus;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons, who in the wars o’ the time
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
As he was born. The King he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
As we do air, fast as ’twas ministered,
And in’s spring became a harvest, lived in court—
Which rare it is to do—most praised, most loved,
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
For whom he now is banished, her own price
Proclaims how she esteemed him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.

**2nd Gent.** I honour him
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
Is she sole child to the King?

**1st Gent.** His only child.
He had two sons. If this be worth your hearing,
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
I’ the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stolen, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.

**2nd Gent.** How long is this ago?

**1st Gent.** Some twenty years.

**2nd Gent.** That a king’s children should be so conveyed,
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
That could not trace them!

**1st Gent.** Howsoe’er ’tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laughed at,
Yet it is true, sir.

**2nd Gent.** I do well believe you.

**1st Gent.** We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
The Queen, and Princess.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.*

**Queen.** No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
After the slander of most stepmothers,
Evil-eyed unto you. You’re my prisoner, but
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
So soon as I can win the offended King,
I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good
You leaned unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.

**Post.** Please your Highness,
I will from hence to-day.

**Queen.** You know the peril.
I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
The pangs of barred affections, though the King
Hath charged you should not speak together.

*Exit.*

**Imo.** O
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
I something fear my father’s wrath; but nothing—
Always reserved my holy duty—what
His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.

**Post.** My queen! my mistress!
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth.
My residence in Rome at one Philario’s,
Who to my father was a friend, to me
Known but by letter. Thither write, my queen,
And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,
Though ink be made of gall.

*Re-enter Queen.*

**Queen.** Be brief, I pray you.
If the King come, I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure.
*\[Aside]* Yet I’ll move him
To walk this way. I never do him wrong,
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
Pays dear for my offences.

*Exit.*

**Post.** Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live,
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

**Imo.** Nay, stay a little.
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
This diamond was my mother’s. Take it, heart;
But keep it till you woo another wife,
When Imogen is dead.

**Post.** How, how! another?
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death!
*\[Putting on the ring.]* Remain, remain thou here
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
As I my poor self did exchange for you,
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
I still win of you. For my sake wear this;
It is a manacle of love; I’ll place it
Upon this fairest prisoner.

*Putting a bracelet upon her arm.*

**Imo.** O the gods!
When shall we see again?

*Enter Cymbeline and Lords.*

**Post.** Alack, the King!

**Cym.** Thou basest thing, avoid! Hence, from my sight!
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
Thou’rt poison to my blood.

**Post.** The gods protect you!
And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.

*Exit.*

**Imo.** There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is.

**Cym.** O disloyal thing,
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st
A year’s age on me.

**Imo.** I beseech you, sir,
Harm not yourself with your vexation.
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs, all fears.

**Cym.** Past grace? obedience?

**Imo.** Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

**Cym.** That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

**Imo.** O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
And did avoid a puttock.

**Cym.** Thou took’st a beggar; wouldst have
Made my throne
A seat for baseness.

**Imo.** No; I rather added
A lustre to it.

**Cym.** O thou vile one!

**Imo.** Sir,
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus.
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
A man worth any woman, overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays.

**Cym.** What, art thou mad?

**Imo.** Almost sir; heaven restore me! Would I were
A neat-herd’s daughter, and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherd’s son!

**Cym.** Thou foolish thing!

*Re-enter Queen.*

They were again together. You have done
Not after our command. Away with her,
And pen her up.

**Queen.** Beseech your patience. Peace,
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
Out of your best advice.

**Cym.** Nay, let her languish
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
Die of this folly!

*Exeunt Cymbeline and Lords.*

**Queen.** Fie! you must give way.

*Enter Pisanio.*

Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

**Pis.** My lord your son drew on my master.

**Queen.** Ha!
No harm, I trust, is done?

**Pis.** There might have been,
But that my master rather played than fought
And had no help of anger. They were parted
By gentlemen at hand.

**Queen.** I am very glad on’t.

**Imo.** Your son’s my father’s friend; he takes his part.
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together;
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?

**Pis.** On his command. He would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven; left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to,
When ’t pleased you to employ me.

**Queen.** This hath been
Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so.

**Pis.** I humbly thank your Highness.

**Queen.** Pray, walk awhile.

**Imo.** About some half-hour hence,
I pray you, speak with me. You shall at least
Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene ii. The same: a public place

*Enter Cloten and two Lords.*

**1st Lord.** Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in. There’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

**Clo.** If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* No, ’faith; not so much as his patience.

**1st Lord.** Hurt him! his body’s a passable carcass, if he be not hurt. It is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* His steel was in debt; it went o’ the backside the town.

**Clo.** The villain would not stand me.

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

**1st Lord.** Stand you! You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having; gave you some ground.

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!

**Clo.** I would they had not come between us.

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* So would I, till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground.

**Clo.** And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damned.

**1st Lord.** Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together. She’s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.

**Clo.** Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!

**2nd Lord.** *\[Aside]* I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.

**Clo.** You’ll go with us?

**1st Lord.** I’ll attend your lordship.

**Clo.** Nay, come, let’s go together.

**2nd Lord.** Well, my lord.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene iii. A room in Cymbeline's palace

*Enter Imogen and Pisanio.*

**Imo.** I would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ the haven,
And questionedst every sail. If he should write,
And I not have it, ’twere a paper lost,
As offered mercy is. What was the last
That he spake to thee?

**Pis.** It was his queen, his queen!

**Imo.** Then waved his handkerchief?

**Pis.** And kissed it, madam.

**Imo.** Senseless linen! happier therein than I!
And that was all?

**Pis.** No, madam; for so long
As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others, he did keep
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of his mind
Could best express how slow his soul sailed on,
How swift his ship.

**Imo.** Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow, or less, ere left
To after-eye him.

**Pis.** Madam, so I did.

**Imo.** I would have broke mine eye-strings; cracked them, but
To look upon him, till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
Nay, followed him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Have turned mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
When shall we hear from him?

**Pis.** Be assured, madam,
With his next vantage.

**Imo.** I did not take my leave of him, but had
Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
To encounter me with orisons, for then
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing.

*Enter a Lady.*

**Lady.** The Queen, madam,
Desires your Highness’ company.

**Imo.** Those things I bid you do, get them dispatched.
I will attend the Queen.

**Pis.** Madam, I shall.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene iv. Rome: Philario's house

*Enter Philario, Iachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard.*

**Iach.** Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I could then have looked on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.

**Phi.** You speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.

**French.** I have seen him in France. We had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

**Iach.** This matter of marrying his King’s daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

**French.** And then his banishment.

**Iach.** Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgement, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?

**Phi.** His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life. Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

*Enter Posthumus.*

I beseech you all, be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

**French.** Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

**Post.** Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

**French.** Sir, you o’er-rate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

**Post.** By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller; rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences. But upon my mended judgement—if I offend not to say it is mended—my quarrel was not altogether slight.

**French.** ’Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or have fallen both.

**Iach.** Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

**French.** Safely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching—and upon warrant of bloody affirmation—his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

**Iach.** That lady is not now living, or this gentleman’s opinion by this worn out.

**Post.** She holds her virtue still and I my mind.

**Iach.** You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.

**Post.** Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.

**Iach.** As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many. But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

**Post.** I praised her as I rated her. So do I my stone.

**Iach.** What do you esteem it at?

**Post.** More than the world enjoys.

**Iach.** Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she’s outprized by a trifle.

**Post.** You are mistaken. The one may be sold, or given, if there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift. The other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.

**Iach.** Which the gods have given you?

**Post.** Which, by their graces, I will keep.

**Iach.** You may wear her in title yours; but, you know, strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stolen too; so your brace of unprizable estimations; the one is but frail and the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.

**Post.** Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

**Phi.** Let us leave here, gentlemen.

**Post.** Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.

**Iach.** With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

**Post.** No, no.

**Iach.** I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring; which, in my opinion, overvalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation. And, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.

**Post.** You are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you’re worthy of by your attempt.

**Iach.** What’s that?

**Post.** A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more; a punishment too.

**Phi.** Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be better acquainted.

**Iach.** Would I had put my estate and my neighbour’s on the approbation of what I have spoke!

**Post.** What lady would you choose to assail?

**Iach.** Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

**Post.** I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; ’tis part of it.

**Iach.** You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.

**Post.** This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.

**Iach.** I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what’s spoken, I swear.

**Post.** Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match; here’s my ring.

**Phi.** I will have it no lay.

**Iach.** By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours; provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.

**Post.** I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer. If you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If she remain unseduced, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.

**Iach.** Your hand; a covenant. We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.

**Post.** Agreed.

*Exeunt Posthumus and Iachimo.*

**French.** Will this hold, think you?

**Phi.** Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us follow ’em.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene v. Britain: a room in Cymbeline's palace

*Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.*

**Queen.** Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers;
Make haste. Who has the note of them?

**1st Lady.** I, madam.

**Queen.** Dispatch.

*Exeunt Ladies.*

Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

**Cor.** Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.

*Presenting a small box.*

But I beseech your Grace, without offence—
My conscience bids me ask—wherefore you have
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
Which are the movers of a languishing death;
But, though slow, deadly?

**Queen.** I wonder, doctor,
Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learned me how
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
That our great King himself doth woo me oft
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded—
Unless thou think’st me devilish—is’t not meet
That I did amplify my judgement in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects.

**Cor.** Your Highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart.
Besides, the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious.

**Queen.** O, content thee.

*Enter Pisanio.*

*\[Aside]* Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
Will I first work. He’s for his master,
And enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
Take your own way.

**Cor.** *\[Aside]* I do suspect you, madam;
But you shall do no harm.

**Queen.** *\[To Pisanio]* Hark thee, a word.

**Cor.** *\[Aside]* I do not like her. She doth think she has
Strange lingering poisons. I do know her spirit,
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damned nature. Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
Which first, perchance, she’ll prove on cats and dogs,
Then afterward up higher. But there is
No danger in what show of death it makes,
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fooled
With a most false effect; and I the truer,
So to be false with her.

**Queen.** No further service, doctor,
Until I send for thee.

**Cor.** I humbly take my leave.

*Exit.*

**Queen.** Weeps she still, say’st thou? Dost thou think in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
I’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master, greater, for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
Continue where he is. To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another,
And every day that comes comes to decay
A day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect,
To be depender on a thing that leans,
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
So much as but to prop him?
*\[The Queen drops the box. Pisanio takes it up.]* Thou takest up
Thou know’st not what; but take it for thy labour.
It is a thing I made, which hath the King
Five times redeemed from death. I do not know
What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee, take it;
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do’t as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
Who shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thou’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
Think on my words.

*Exit Pisanio.*

A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
To taste of too.

*Re-enter Pisanio and Ladies.*

So, so; well done, well done.
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
Think on my words.

*Exeunt Queen and Ladies.*

**Pis.** And shall do.
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
I’ll choke myself; there’s all I’ll do for you.

*Exit.*

### Scene vi. The same: another room in the palace

*Enter Imogen.*

**Imo.** A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
That hath her husband banished—O, that husband!
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stolen,
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
Is the desire that’s glorious. Blest be those,
How mean soe’er, that have their honest wills,
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

*Enter Pisanio and Iachimo.*

**Pis.** Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
Comes from my lord with letters.

**Iach.** Change you, madam?

The worthy Leonatus is in safety
And greets your Highness dearly.

*Presents a letter.*

Imo. Thanks, good sir;
You’re kindly welcome.

Iach. *[Aside]* All of her that is out of door most rich!
If she be furnish’d with a mind so rare,
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
Rather, directly fly.

Imo. *[Reads]* “He is one of the noblest note,
to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied.
Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your
trust — Leonatus”

So far I read aloud;
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warm’d by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
In all that I can do.

Iach. Thanks, fairest lady.
What are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
Of sea and land, which can distinguish ’twixt
The fiery orbs above and the twinn’d stones
Upon the number’d beach? and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
’Twixt fair and foul?

Imo. What makes your admiration?

Iach. It cannot be i’ the eye, for apes and monkeys
’Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other; nor i’ the judgement,
For idiots in this case of favour would
Be wisely definite; nor i’ the appetite;
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
Should make desire vomit emptiness,
Not so allured to feed.

Imo. What is the matter, trow?

Iach. The cloyed will,
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
Both fill’d and running, ravening first the lamb
Longs after for the garbage.

Imo. What, dear sir,
Thus raps you? Are you well?

Iach. Thanks, madam; well. *[To Pisanio]* Beseech you, sir, desire
My man’s abode where I did leave him. He
Is strange and peevish.

Pis. I was going, sir,
To give him welcome. *[Exit]*

Imo. Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

Iach. Well, madam.

Imo. Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

Iach. Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome. He is call’d
The Briton reveller.

Imo. When he was here,
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
Not knowing why.

Iach. I never saw him sad.
There is a Frenchman his companion, one
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton —
Your lord, I mean — laughs from’s free lungs, cries, “O,
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
By history, report, or his own proof,
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
But must be, will his free hours languish for
Assured bondage?”

Imo. Will my lord say so?

Iach. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
Some men are much to blame.

Imo. Not he, I hope.

Iach. Not he; but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might
Be used more thankfully. In himself, ’tis much;
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
To pity too.

Imo. What do you pity, sir?

Iach. Two creatures heartily.

Imo. Am I one, sir?
You look on me. What wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity?

Iach. Lamentable! What,
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
I’ the dungeon by a snuff?

Imo. I pray you, sir,
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands. Why do you pity me?

Iach. That others do —
I was about to say — enjoy your — But
It is an office of the gods to venge it,
Not mine to speak on ’t.

Imo. You do seem to know
Something of me, or what concerns me. Pray you —
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do; for certainties
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
The remedy then born — discover to me
What both you spur and stop.

Iach. Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
Whose every touch, would force the feeler’s soul
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
Fixing it only here; should I, damn’d then,
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehood — falsehood, as
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
That’s fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt.

Imo. My lord, I fear,
Has forgot Britain.

Iach. And himself. Not I,
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
The beggary of his change; but ’tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out.

Imo. Let me hear no more.

Iach. O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
So fair, and fasten’d to an empery,
Would make the great’st king double — to be partner’d
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boiled stuff
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Recoil from your great stock.

Imo. Revenged!
How should I be revenged? If this be true —
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse — if it be true,
How should I be revenged?

Iach. Should he make me
Live, like Diana’s priest, betwixt cold sheets,
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
More noble than that runagate to your bed,
And will continue fast to your affection,
Still close as sure.

Imo. What, ho, Pisanio!

Iach. Let me my service tender on your lips.

Imo. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek’st — as base as strange.
Thou wrong’st a gentleman, who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour, and
Solicit’st here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
The King my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit,
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

Iach. O happy Leonatus! I may say.
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country call’d his! and you his mistress, only
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,
That which he is, new o’er; and he is one
The truest-mannered, such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him;
Half all men’s hearts are his.

Imo. You make amends.

Iach. He sits ’mongst men like a descended god.
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
To try your taking of a false report; which hath
Honour’d with confirmation your great judgement
In the election of a sir so rare,
Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

Imo. All’s well, sir. Take my power i’ the court for yours.

Iach. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
To entreat your Grace but in a small request,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business.

Imo. Pray, what is ’t?

Iach. Some dozen Romans of us and your lord —
The best feather of our wing — have mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor;
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France. ’Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
To take them in protection?

Imo. Willingly;
And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber.

Iach. They are in a trunk,
Attended by my men. I will make bold
To send them to you, only for this night;
I must aboard to-morrow.

Imo. O, no, no.

Iach. Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
By lengthening my return. From Gallia
I cross’d the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your Grace.

Imo. I thank you for your pains;
But not away to-morrow!

Iach. O, I must, madam;
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
To greet your lord with writing, do ’t to-night.
I have outstood my time; which is material
To the tender of our present.

Imo. I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.

*[Exeunt.]*

## ACT II

### Scene i. Britain: before Cymbeline's palace

*Enter Cloten and two Lords.*

Clo. Was there ever man had such luck! when I
kissed the jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I
had a hundred pound on ’t; and then a whoreson
jackanapes must take me up for swearing; as if I
borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend
them at my pleasure.

1st Lord. What got he by that? You have broke
his pate with your bowl.

2nd Lord. *[Aside]* If his wit had been like him
that broke it, it would have run all out.

Clo. When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it
is not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

2nd Lord. No, my lord; *[Aside]* nor crop the
ears of them.

Clo. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
Would he had been one of my rank!

2nd Lord. *[Aside]* To have smelt like a fool.

Clo. I am not vexed more at anything in the
earth; a pox on ’t! I had rather not be so noble as
I am; they dare not fight with me, because of the
Queen my mother. Every Jack-slave hath his
bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down
like a cock that nobody can match.

2nd Lord. *[Aside]* You are cock and capon too;
and you crow, cock, with your comb on.

Clo. Sayest thou?

2nd Lord. It is not fit your lordship should
undertake every companion that you give offence
to.

Clo. No, I know that. But it is fit I should com-
mit offence to my inferiors.

2nd Lord. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

Clo. Why, so I say.

1st Lord. Did you hear of a stranger that’s come
to court to-night?

Clo. A stranger, and I not know on ’t!

2nd Lord. *[Aside]* He’s a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.

1st Lord. There’s an Italian come; and, ’tis
thought, one of Leonatus’ friends.

Clo. Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he’s an-
other, whatsoever he be. Who told you of this
stranger?

1st Lord. One of your lordship’s pages.

Clo. Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
derogation in ’t?

2nd Lord. You cannot derogate, my lord.

Clo. Not easily, I think.

2nd Lord. *[Aside]* You are a fool granted; there-
fore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

Clo. Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have
lost to-day at bowls I’ll win to-night of him.
Come, go.

2nd Lord. I’ll attend your lordship.

*[Exeunt Cloten and First Lord.]*

That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern’d,
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he’d make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
To enjoy thy banish’d lord and this great land!

*[Exit.]*

### Scene ii. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace; a trunk in one corner of it

*Imogen in bed, reading; Helen, a Lady, attending.*

Imo. Who’s there? my woman Helen?

Hel. Please you, madam.

Imo. What hour is it?

Hel. Almost midnight, madam.

Imo. I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are
weak.
Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
And if thou canst awake by four o’ the clock,
I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly.

*[Exit Helen.]*

To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me, beseech ye.

*[Sleeps. Iachimo comes from the trunk.]*

Iach. The crickets sing, and man’s o’er-labour’d
sense
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken’d
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon’d,
How dearly they do ’t! ’Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o’ the
taper
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
Under these windows, white and azure-laced
With blue of heaven’s own tinct. But my design,
To note the chamber. I will write all down.
Such and such pictures; there the window; such
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
Why, such and such; and the contents o’ the
story.
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
And be her sense but as a monument,
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off.

*[Taking off her bracelet.]*

As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
’Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
As strongly as the conscience does within,
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
I’ the bottom of a cowslip. Here’s a voucher,
Stronger than ever law could make. This secret
Will force him think I have pick’d the lock and ta’en
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what
end?
Why should I write this down, that’s riveted,
Screw’d to my memory? She hath been reading
late
The tale of *Tereus*; here the leaf’s turn’d down
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawn-
ing
May bare the raven’s eye! I lodge in fear;
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.

*[Clock strikes.]*

One, two, three; time, time!

*[Goes into the trunk. The scene closes.]*

### Scene iii. An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments

*Enter Cloten and Lords.*

1st Lord. Your lordship is the most patient man
in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace.

Clo. It would make any man cold to lose.

1st Lord. But not every man patient after the
noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot
and furious when you win.

Clo. Winning will put any man into courage. If I
could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold
enough. It’s almost morning, is ’t not?

1st Lord. Day, my lord.

Clo. I would this music would come. I am ad-
vised to give her music o’ mornings; they say it
will penetrate.

*Enter Musicians.*

Come on; tune. If you can penetrate her with
your fingering, so; we’ll try with tongue too. If
none will do, let her remain; but I’ll never give
o’er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
words to it; and then let her consider.

*Song*

Hark, hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings,
And Phoebus ’gins arise.
His steeds to water at those springs
On chaliced flowers that lie;
And winking Mary-buds begin
To ope their golden eyes;
With every thing that pretty is,
My lady sweet, arise,
Arise, arise.

Clo. So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a
vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and calves’-
guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot,
can never amend. *[Exeunt Musicians.]*

2nd Lord. Here comes the King.

Clo. I am glad I was up so late; for that’s the
reason I was up so early. He cannot choose but
take this service I have done fatherly.

*Enter Cymbeline and Queen.*

Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gra-
cious mother.

Cym. Attend you here the door of our stern
daughter?
Will she not forth?

Clo. I have assailed her with music, but she
vouchsafes no notice.

Cym. The exile of her minion is too new;
She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
And then she’s yours.

Queen. You are most bound to the King,
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting, and be friended
With aptness of the season; make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
Save when command to your dismission tends,
And therein you are senseless.

Clo. Senseless! not so.

*Enter a Messenger.*

Mess. So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
The one is Caius Lucius.

Cym. A worthy fellow,
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him
According to the honour of his sender;
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on
us,
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
When you have given good morning to your
mistress,
Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our
queen. *[Exeunt all but Cloten.]*

Clo. If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not,
Let her lie still and dream. *[Knocks]* By your
leave, ho!
I know her women are about her. What
If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold
Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and
makes
Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up
Their deer to the stand o’ the stealer; and ’tis
gold
Which makes the true man kill’d and saves the
thief;
Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man.
What
Can it not do and undo? I will make
One of her women lawyer to me, for
I yet not understand the case myself. *[Knocks]* By your leave.

*Enter Helen.*

Hel. Who’s there that knocks?

Clo. A gentleman.

Hel. No more?

Clo. Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son.

Hel. That’s more
Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
Can justly boast of. What’s your lordship’s
pleasure?

Clo. Your lady’s person. Is she ready?

Hel. Ay,
To keep her chamber.

Clo. There is gold for you;
Sell me your good report.

Hel. How! my good name? or to report of you
What I shall think is good? — The Princess!

*Enter Imogen.*

Clo. Good morrow, fairest. Sister, your sweet
hand. *[Exit Helen.]*

Imo. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much
pains
For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them.

Clo. Still, I swear I love you.

Imo. If you but said so, ’twere as deep with me.
If you swear still, your recompense is still
That I regard it not.

Clo. This is no answer.

Imo. But that you shall not say I yield being
silent,
I would nor speak. I pray you, spare me. ’Faith,
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness. One of your great know-
ing
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

Clo. To leave you in your madness, ’twere my
sin.
I will not.

Imo. Fools are not mad folks.

Clo. Do you call me fool?

Imo. As I am mad, I do.
If you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad;
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
You put me to forget a lady’s manners,
By being so verbal. And learn now, for all,
That I, which know my heart, do here pro-
nounce,
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
And am so near the lack of charity —
To accuse myself — I hate you; which I had
rather
You felt than make ’t my boast.

Clo. You sin against
Obedience, which you owe your father. For
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
One bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes,
With scraps o’ the court, it is no contract, none.
And though it be allow’d in meaner parties —
Yet who than he more mean? — to knit their
souls,
On whom there is no more dependency
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
Yet you are curb’d from that enlargement by
The consequence o’ the crown, and must not soil
The precious note of it with a base slave,
A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,
A pantler, not so eminent.

Imo. Profane fellow!
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if ’twere made
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
For being preferr’d so well.

Clo. The south-fog rot him!

Imo. He never can meet more mischance than
come
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
That ever hath but clipp’d his body, is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisa-
nio!

*Enter Pisanio.*

Clo. “His garment!” Now the devil —

Imo. To Dorothy my woman hie thee present-
ly —.

Clo. “His garment!”

Imo. I am sprited with a fool,
Frighted, and anger’d worse. Go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm. It was thy master’s; ’shrew
me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king’s in Europe. I do think
I saw’t this morning. Confident I am
Last night ’twas on mine arm; I kiss’d it.
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

Pis. ’Twill not be lost.

Imo. I hope so. Go and search.

*[Exit Pisanio.]*

Clo. You have abused me.
“His meanest garment!”

Imo. Ay, I said so, sir.
If you will make ’t an action, call witness to ’t.

Clo. I will inform your father.

Imo. Your mother too.
She’s my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
To the worst of discontent. *[Exit.]*

Clo. I’ll be revenged.
“His meanest garment!” Well. *[Exit.]*

### Scene iv. Rome: Philario's house

*Enter Posthumus and Philario.*

Post. Fear it not, sir. I would I were so sure
To win the King as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers.

Phi. What means do you make to him?

Post. Not any, but abide the change of time,
Quake in the present winter’s state and wish
That warmer days would come. In these sear’d
hopes,
I barely gratify your love; they failing,
I must die much your debtor.

Phi. Your very goodness and your company
O’erpays all I can do. By this, your king
Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
Will do his commission thoroughly; and I think
He’ll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief.

Post. I do believe,
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
Are men more order’d than when Julius Caesar
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found their
courage
Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
Now mingled with their courages, will make
known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world.

*Enter Iachimo.*

Phi. See! Iachimo!

Post. The swiftest harts have posted you by
land;
And winds of all the corners kiss’d your sails,
To make your vessel nimble.

Phi. Welcome, sir.

Post. I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return.

Iach. Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have look’d upon.

Post. And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them.

Iach. Here are letters for you.

Post. Their tenour good, I trust.

Iach. ’Tis very like.

Phi. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?

Iach. He was expected then,
But not approach’d.

Post. All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is ’t not
Too dull for your good wearing?

Iach. If I had lost it,
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
I’ll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

Post. The stone’s too hard to come by.

Iach. Not a whit,
Your lady being so easy.

Post. Make not, sir,
Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends.

Iach. Good sir, we must,
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
We were to question further; but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour,
Together with your ring; and not the wronger
Of her or you, having proceeded but
By both your wills.

Post. If you can make ’t apparent
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them.

Iach. Sir, my circumstances,
Being so near the truth as I will make them,
Must first induce you to believe; whose strength
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
You’ll give me leave to spare, when you shall
find
You need it not.

Post. Proceed.

Iach. First, her bedchamber —
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
Had that was well worth watching — it was
hang’d
With tapestry of silk and silver; the story
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
And Cydnus swelled above the banks, or for
The press of boats or pride; a piece of work
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
In workmanship and value; which I wonder’d
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
Since the true life on ’t was —

Post. This is true;
And this you might have heard of here, by me,
Or by some other.

Iach. More particulars
Must justify my knowledge.

Post. So they must,
Or do your honour injury.

Iach. The chimney
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves. The cutter
Was as another Nature, dumb; outwent her.
Motion and breath left out.

Post. This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap,
Being, as it is, much spoke of.

Iach. The roof o’ the chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons —
I had forgot them — were two winking Cupids
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
Depending on their brands.

Post. This is her honour!
Let it be granted you have seen all this — and
praise
Be given to your remembrance — the description

# CYMBELINE

**Iachimo.** Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
the wager you have laid. Then, if you can—

*(Showing the bracelet.)*

Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
And now ’tis up again. It must be married
To that your diamond; I’ll keep them.

**Posthumus.** Jove!

Once more let me behold it. Is it that
Which I left with her?

**Iachimo.** Sir — I thank her — that.

She stripp’d it from her arm; I see her yet;
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
And yet enrich’d it too. She gave it me, and said
She priz’d it once.

**Posthumus.** May be she pluck’d it off
To send it me.

**Iachimo.** She writes so to you, doth she?

**Posthumus.** O, no, no, no! ’tis true. Here, take this too; *(Gives the ring.)*

It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
Kills me to look on ’t. Let there be no honour
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance;
Love where there’s another man. The vows of women
Be of no more bondage to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
O, above measure false!

**Philario.** Have patience, sir,
And take your ring again; ’tis not yet won.
It may be probable she lost it; or,
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
Hath stol’n it from her?

**Posthumus.** Very true;
And so, I hope, he came by ’t. Back my ring.
Render to me some corporal sign about her,
More evident than this; for this was stolen.

**Iachimo.** By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

**Posthumus.** Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
’Tis true — nay, keep the ring — ’tis true. I am sure
She would not lose it. Her attendants are
All sworn and honourable. They induced to steal it!
And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy’d her.
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!

**Philario.** Sir, be patient.
This is not strong enough to be believed
Of one persuaded well of—

**Posthumus.** Never talk on ’t;
She hath been colted by him.

**Iachimo.** If you seek
For further satisfying, under her breast—
Worthy the pressing—lies a mole, right proud
Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
I kiss’d it; and it gave me present hunger
To feed again, though full. You do remember
This stain upon her?

**Posthumus.** Ay, and it doth confirm
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it.

**Iachimo.** Will you hear more?

**Posthumus.** Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns;
Once, and a million!

**Iachimo.** I’ll be sworn—

**Posthumus.** No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done ’t, you lie;
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
Thou’st made me cuckold.

**Iachimo.** I’ll deny nothing.

**Posthumus.** O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
I will go there and do ’t, i’ the court, before
Her father. I’ll do something— *(Exit.)*

**Philario.** Quite besides
The government of patience! You have won.
Let’s follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself.

**Iachimo.** With all my heart. *(Exeunt.)*

### Scene V. Another room in Philario’s house

Enter Posthumus.

**Posthumus.** Is there no way for men to be but women
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father, was, I know not where,
When I was stamp’d; some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit. Yet my mother seem’d
The Dian of that time; so doth my wife
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain’d
And pray’d me oft forbearance; did it with
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on ’t
Might well have warm’d old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn’d snow. O, all the devils!
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour—was ’t not?—
Or less—at first?—perchance he spoke not, but,
Like a full-acorn’d boar, a German one,
Cried “O!” and mounted; found no opposition
But what he look’d for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
The woman’s part in me! For there’s no motion
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it,
The woman’s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
For even to vice they are not constant, but are changing still
One vice, but of a minute old, for one
Not half so old as that. I’ll write against them,
Detest them, curse them. Yet ’tis greater skill
In a true hate, to pray they have their will;
The very devils cannot plague them better.

*(Exit.)*

## ACT III

Scene i. Britain: a hall in Cymbeline’s palace

Enter in state Cymbeline, the Queen, Cloten, and Lords at one door; and at another, Caius Lucius and Attendants.

**Cymbeline.** Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

**Lucius.** When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
Lives in men’s eyes and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
And conquer’d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle—
Famous in Caesar’s praises, no whit less
Than in his feats deserving it—for him
and his succession granted Rome a tribute,
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee
lately is left untendered.

**Queen.** And, to kill the marvel,
Shall be so ever.

**Cloten.** There be many Caesars,
Ere such another Julius. Britain is
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
For wearing our own noses.

**Queen.** That opportunity
Which then they had to take from ’s, to resume,
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege.
The kings your ancestors, together with
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
As Neptune’s park, ribbed and paled in
With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,
With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats,
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
Of “Came and saw and overcame.” With shame—
The first that ever touch’d him—he was carried
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping—
Poor ignorant baubles!—on our terrible seas,
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack’d
As easily ’gainst our rocks; for joy whereof
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point—
O giglot fortune!—to master Caesar’s sword,
Made Lud’s town with rejoicing fires bright,
And Britons strut with courage.

**Cloten.** Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid.
Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time;
and, as I said, there is no more such Caesars. Other
of them may have crook’d noses, but to owe such
straight arms, none.

**Cymbeline.** Son, let your mother end.

**Cloten.** We have yet many among us can gripe as
hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I
have a hand. Why tribute? why should we pay
tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a
blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will
pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

**Cymbeline.** You must know,
Till the injurious Romans did extort
This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar’s ambition,
Which swell’d so much that it did almost stretch
The sides o’ the world, against all colour here
Did put the yoke upon ’s; which to shake off
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
Ourselves to be.

**Cloten and Lords.** We do.

**Cymbeline.** Say, then, to Caesar,
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Ordain’d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
Who was the first of Britain which did put
His brows within a golden crown and call’d
Himself a king.

**Lucius.** I am sorry, Cymbeline,
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar—
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
Thyself domestic officers—thine enemy.
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
In Caesar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee. Look
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
I thank thee for myself.

**Cymbeline.** Thou art welcome, Caius.
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
Much under him; of him I gather’d honour;
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold.
So Caesar shall not find them.

**Lucius.** Let proof speak.

**Cloten.** His Majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there’s an end.

**Lucius.** So, sir.

**Cymbeline.** I know your master’s pleasure and he mine;
All the remain is “Welcome!” *(Exeunt.)*

Scene ii. Another room in the palace

Enter Pisanio, with a letter.

**Pisanio.** How! of adultery? Wherefore write you not
What monster’s her accuser? Leonatus!
O master! what a strange infection
Is fall’n into thy ear! What false Italian,
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail’d
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No.
She’s punish’d for her truth, and undergoes,
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
As would take in some virtue. O my master!
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
If it be so to do good service, never
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
So much as this fact comes to? *(Reading)* “Do ’t.
The letter that I have sent her, by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity.” O, damn’d paper!
Black as the ink that’s on thee! Senseless bauble,
Art thou a fedary for this act, and look’st
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

Enter Imogen.

**Imogen.** How now, Pisanio!

**Pisanio.** Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

**Imogen.** Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
O, learn’d indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters;
He’d lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contain’d relish of love,
Of my lord’s health, of his content, yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him.
Some griefs are medicinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love; of his content,
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel.
Lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike.
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid’s tables. Good news, gods!

*(Stage direction or marginal number removed.)*

*(Imogen reads.)*

“Justice, and your father’s wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford-Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love,

Leonatus Posthumus.”

**Imogen.** O, for a horse with wings! Hear’st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford-Haven. Read, and tell me
How far ’tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio—
Who long’st, like me, to see thy lord; who long’st—
O, let me bate—but not like me—yet long’st,
But in a fainter kind.—O, not like me;
For mine’s beyond beyond—say, and speak thick;
Love’s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
To the smothering of the sense—how far it is
To this same blessed Milford; and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven; but first of all,
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence?
Why should excuse be born or e’er begot?
We’ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
How many score of miles may we well ride
’Twixt hour and hour?

**Pisanio.** One score ’twixt sun and sun,
Madam, ’s enough for you; *(Aside)* and too much too.

**Imogen.** Why, one that rode to’s execution, man,
Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers,
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i’ the clock’s behalf. But this is foolery.
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She’ll home to her father; and provide me presently
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin’s housewife.

**Pisanio.** Madam, you’re best consider.

**Imogen.** I see before me, man; nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
Do as I bid thee. There’s no more to say;
Accessible is none but Milford way. *(Exeunt.)*

Scene iii. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave

Enter, from the cave, Belarius; Guiderius and Arviragus following.

**Belarius.** A goodly day not to keep house, with such
Whose roofs as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
To a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs
Are arch’d so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on, without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i’ the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As proud livers do.

**Guiderius.** Hail, heaven!

**Arviragus.** Hail, heaven!

**Belarius.** Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill;
Your legs are young; I’ll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off;
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
This service is not service, so being done,
But being so allow’d. To apprehend thus
Draws us a profit from all things we see;
And often, to our comfort, shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing’d eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a check,
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk.
Such gain the cap of him that makes ’em fine,
Yet keeps his book uncross’d. No life to ours.

**Guiderius.** Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledged,
Have never wing’d from view o’ the nest, nor know
What air’s from home. Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age. But unto us it is
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit.

**Arviragus.** What should we speak of
When we are old as you? When we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
We make a quire, as doth the prison’d bird,
And sing our bondage freely.

**Belarius.** How you speak!
Did you but know the city’s usuries
And felt them knowingly; the art o’ the court,
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
Is certain falling, or so slippery that
The fear’s as bad as falling; the toil o’ the war,
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
In the name of fame and honour; which dies i’ the search,
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
As record of fair act; nay, many times,
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what’s worse,
Must court’ sy at the censure. O boys, this story
The world may read in me. My body’s mark’d
With Roman swords, and my report was once
First with the best of note. Cymbeline loved me,
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night,
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
And left me bare to weather.

**Guiderius.** Uncertain favour!

**Belarius.** My fault being nothing—as I have told you oft—
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail’d
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans. So
Follow’d my banishment, and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
This is not hunters’ language. He that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o’ the feast;
To him the other two shall minister;
And we will fear no poison, which attends
In place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys. *(Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus.)*
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to the King;
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine; and though train’d up thus meanly
I’ the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
The King his father call’d Guiderius—Jove!
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Into my story; say “Thus mine enemy fell,
And thus I set my foot on’s neck”; even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
roused!—O Cymbeline! Heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
Thou reft’st me of my lands. Euriphile,
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
And every day do honour to her grave.
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call’d,
They take for natural father.—The game is up. *(Exit.)*

Scene iv. Country near Milford-Haven

Enter Pisanio and Imogen.

**Imogen.** Thou told’st me, when we came from horse, the place
Was near at hand; ne’er long’d my mother so
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
From the inward of thee? One but painted thus
Would be interpreted a thing perplex’d
Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
Into a behaviour of less fear, ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses. What’s the matter?
Why tender’st thou that paper to me, with
A look untender? If ’t be summer news,
Smile to ’t before; if winterly, thou need’st
But keep that countenance still. My husband’s hand!
That drug-damned Italy hath out-craftied him,
And he’s at some hard point. Speak, man. Thy tongue
May take off some extremity, which to read
Would be even mortal to me.

**Pisanio.** Please you, read;
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
The most disdain’d of fortune.

**Imogen.** *(Reads.)* “Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life. I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal.”

**Pisanio.** What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
Hath cut her throat already. No, ’tis slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

**Imogen.** False to his bed! What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
To weep ’twixt clock and clock? if sleep charge nature,
To break it with a fearful dream of him
And cry myself awake? that’s false to’s bed, is it?

**Pisanio.** Alas, good lady!

**Imogen.** I false! Thy conscience witness. Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Thou then look’dst like a villain; now methinks
Thy favour’s good enough. Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray’d him.
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
I must be ripp’d—To pieces with me! O,
Men’s vows are women’s traitors! All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villainy; not born where ’t grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.

**Pisanio.** Good madam, hear me.

**Imogen.** True honest men being heard, like false Tineas,
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon’s weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest.
Do thou thy master’s bidding. When thou see’st him,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
I draw the sword myself. Take it, and hit
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
Fear not; ’tis empty of all things but grief.
Thy master is not there, who was indeed
The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
But now thou seem’st a coward.

**Pisanio.** Hence, vile instrument!
Thou shalt not damn my hand.

**Imogen.** Why, I must die;
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
No servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart.
Something’s afore’t. Soft, soft! we’ll no defence;
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
All turn’d to heresy? Away, away,
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers. Though those that are betray’d
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe.
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
My disobedience ’gainst the King my father
And make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
It is no act of common passage, but
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
Will then be pang’d by me. Prithee, dispatch;
The lamb entreats the butcher; where’s thy knife?
Thou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding,
When I desire it too.

**Pisanio.** O gracious lady,
Since I received command to do this business
I have not slept one wink.

**Imogen.** Do’t, and to bed then.

**Pisanio.** I’ll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

**Imogen.** Wherefore then
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence? this place?
Mine action and thine own? our horses’ labour?
The time inviting thee? the perturb’d court,
For my being absent? whereunto I never
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far, no
To be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand,
The elected deer before thee?

**Pisanio.** But to win time
To lose so bad employment; in the which
I have consider’d of a course. Good lady,
Hear me with patience.

**Imogen.** Talk thy tongue weary; speak.
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear,
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

**Pisanio.** Then, madam,
I thought you would not back again.

**Imogen.** Most like;
Bringing me here to kill me.

**Pisanio.** Not so, neither.
But if I were as wise as honest, then
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
But that my master is abused.
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art,
Hath done you both this cursed injury.

**Imogen.** Some Roman courtezan.

**Pisanio.** No, on my life.
I’ll give but notice you are dead and send him
Some bloody sign of it; for ’tis commanded
I should do so. You shall be miss’d at court,
And that will well confirm it.

**Imogen.** Why, good fellow,
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?
Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dead to my husband?

**Pisanio.** If you’ll back to the court—

**Imogen.** No court, no father; nor no more ado
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege.

**Pisanio.** If not at court,
Then not in Britain must you bide.

**Imogen.** Where then?
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
Are they not but in Britain? I’ the world’s volume
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in’t;
In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee, think
There’s livers out of Britain.

**Pisanio.** I am most glad
You think of other place. The ambassador,
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
To-morrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
But by self-danger, you should tread a course
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
That though his actions were not visible, yet
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves.

**Imogen.** O, for such means!
Though peril to my modesty, not death on’t,
I would adventure.

**Pisanio.** Well, then, here’s the point.
You must forget to be a woman; change
Command into obedience; fear and niceness—
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
Woman itself—into a waggish courage;
Ready in gibes, quick-answer’d, saucy, and
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
Exposing it—but, O, the harder heart!
Alack, no remedy!—to the greedy touch
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
You made great Juno angry.

**Imogen.** Nay, be brief.
I see into thy end and am almost
A man already.

**Pisanio.** First, make yourself but like one.
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit—
’Tis in my cloak-bag—doublet, hat, hose, all
That answer to them. Would you in their serving,
And with what imitation you can borrow
From youth of such a season, ’fore noble Lucius
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
Wherein you’re happy—which you’ll make him know,
If that his head have ear in music—doubtless
With joy he will embrace you, for he’s honourable
And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
You have me, rich; and I will never fail
Beginning nor supplyment.

**Imogen.** Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away.
There’s more to be consider’d; but we’ll even
All that good time will give us. This attempt
I am soldier to, and will abide it with
A prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.

**Pisanio.** Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
Lest, being miss’d, I be suspected of
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
Here is a box; I had it from the Queen.
What’s in ’t is precious; if you are sick at sea,
Or stomach-qualm’d at land, a dram of this
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
Direct you to the best!

**Imogen.** Amen! I thank thee. *(Exeunt, severally.)*

Scene v. A room in Cymbeline’s palace

Enter Cymbeline, the Queen, Cloten, Lucius, Lords, and Attendants.

**Cymbeline.** Thus far; and so farewell.

**Lucius.** Thanks, royal sir.
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;

And am right sorry that I must report ye
My master’s enemy.

## SCENE V

CYMBELINE

Cym. Our subjects, sir,
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
Appear unkinglike.

Luc. So, sir. I desire of you
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
Madam, all joy befall your Grace!

Queen. And you!

Cym. My lords, you are appointed for that
office;
The due of honour in no point omit.
So farewell, noble Lucius.

Luc. Your hand, my lord.

Clo. Receive it friendly; but from this time
forth
I wear it as your enemy.

Luc. Sir, the event
Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.

Cym. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my
lords,
Till he have cross’d the Severn. Happiness!
[Exeunt Lucius and Lords.]

Queen. He goes hence frowning; but it honours us
That we have given him cause.

Clo. ’Tis all the better;
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

Cym. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he
moves
His war for Britain.

Queen. ’Tis not sleepy business;
But must be look’d to speedily and strongly.

Cym. Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear’d
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender’d
The duty of the day. She looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
We have noted it. Call her before us; for
We have been too slight in sufferance.
[Exit an attendant.]

Queen. Royal sir,
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
’Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
Forbear sharp speeches to her. She’s a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her.

Cym. Can her contempt be answer’d?
[Re-enter attendant.]

Atten. Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all lock’d; and there’s no answer
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

Queen. My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray’d me to excuse her keeping close,
Whereto constrain’d by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
She wish’d me to make known; but our great
court
Made me to blame in memory.

Cym. Her doors lock’d?
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
Prove false!
[Exit.]

Queen. Son, I say, follow the King.

Clo. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
I have not seen these two days.

Queen. Go, look after.
[Exit Cloten.]
Pisanio, thou that stand’st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized
her,
Or, wing’d with fervour of her love, she’s flown
To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is
To death or to dishonour; and my end
Can make good use of either. She being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.

[Re-enter Cloten.]

How now, my son!

Clo. ’Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
Dare come about him.

Queen. [Aside] All the better. May
This night forestall him of the coming day!
[Exit.]

Clo. I love and hate her; for she’s fair and
royal,
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgement
That what’s else rare is choked; and in that point
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
To be revenged upon her. For when fools
Shall—

[Enter Pisanio.]

Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
Come hither. Ah, you precious pandar! Villain,
Where is thy lady? In a word; or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

Pis. O, good my lord!

Clo. Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter,
I will not ask again. Close villain,
I’ll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn.

Pis. Alas, my lord,
How can she be with him? When was she miss’d?
He is in Rome.

Clo. Where is she, sir? Come nearer;
No further halting. Satisfy me home
What is become of her.

Pis. O, my all-worthy lord!

Clo. All-worthy villain!
Discover where thy mistress is at once,
At the next word. No more of “worthy lord!”
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death.

Pis. Then, sir,
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight.
[Presenting a letter.]

Clo. Let’s see’t. I will pursue her
Even to Augustus’ throne.

Pis. [Aside] Or this, or perish.
She’s far enough; and what he learns by this
May prove his travel, not her danger.

Clo. Hum!

Pis. [Aside] I’ll write to my lord she’s dead.
O Imogen,
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

Clo. Sirrah, is this letter true?

Pis. Sir, as I think.

Clo. It is Posthumus’ hand; I know’t. Sirrah,
if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true
service, undergo those employments wherein
I should have cause to use thee with a serious
industry, that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee
do, to perform it directly and truly, I would
think thee an honest man. Thou shouldst neither
want my means for thy relief nor my voice for
thy preferment.

Pis. Well, my good lord.

Clo. Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently
and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare for¬
tune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in
the course of gratitude, but be a diligent fol¬
lower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?

Pis. Sir, I will.

Clo. Give me thy hand; here’s my purse.
Hast any of thy late master’s garments in thy
possession?

Pis. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same
suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and
mistress.

Clo. The first service thou dost me, fetch that
suit hither. Let it be thy first service; go.

Pis. I shall, my lord.
[Exit.]

Clo. Meet thee at Milford-Haven!—I forgot
to ask him one thing; I’ll remember’t anon.—
even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill
thee. I would these garments were come. She
said upon a time—the bitterness of it I now belch
from my heart—that she held the very garment
of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and
natural person, together with the adornment of
my qualities. With that suit upon my back will
I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes; there
shall she see my valour, which will then be a tor¬
ment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
when my lust hath dined—which, as I say, to
vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so
praised—to the court I’ll knock her back, foot
her home again. She hath despised me rejoic¬
ingly, and I’ll be merry in my revenge.

[Re-enter Pisanio, with the clothes.]

Be those the garments?

Pis. Ay, my noble lord.

Clo. How long is’t since she went to Milford-
Haven?

Pis. She can scarce be there yet.

Clo. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that
is the second thing that I have commanded thee.
The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to
my design. Be but duteous, and true prefer¬
ment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is
now at Milford. Would I had wings to follow it!
Come, and be true.
[Exit.]

Pis. Thou bid’st me to my loss; for true to thee
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
To him that is most true. To Milford go,
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow,
flow,
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool’s
speed
Be cross’d with slowness; labour be his meed!
[Exit.]

## Scene VI. Wales: before the cave of Belarius

[Enter Imogen, in boy’s clothes.]

Imo. I see a man’s life is a tedious one.
I have tired myself, and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed. I should be
sick,
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show’d
thee,
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars
told me
I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing ’tis to
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in
fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
Thou art one o’ the false ones. Now I think on
thee,
My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to’t. ’Tis some savage hold.
I were best not call; I dare not call; yet famine,
Ere clean it o’erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
Plenty and peace breed cowards; hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who’s here?
If anything that’s civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I’ll enter.
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me, he’ll scarcely look
on’t.
Such a foe, good heavens!
[Exit, to the cave.]

[Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.]

Bel. You, Polydore, have proved best woodman
and
Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
Will play the cook and servant; ’tis our match.
The sweat of industry would dry and die,
But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
Will make what’s homely savoury. Weariness
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
Poor house, that keep’st thyself!

Gui. I am thoroughly weary.

Arv. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

Gui. There is cold meat i’ the cave; we’ll
browse on that,
Whilst what we have kill’d be cook’d.

Bel. [Looking into the cave] Stay; come not in.
But that it eats our victuals, I should think
Here were a fairy.

Gui. What’s the matter, sir?

Bel. By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
No elder than a boy!

[Re-enter Imogen.]

Imo. Good masters, harm me not.
Before I enter’d here, I call’d; and thought
To have begg’d or bought what I have took.
Good troth,
I have stol’n nought, nor would not, though I had
found
Gold strew’d i’ the floor. Here’s money for my
meat.
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal, and parted
With prayers for the provider.

Gui. Money, youth?

Arv. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
As ’tis no better reckon’d, but of those
Who worship dirty gods.

Imo. I see you’re angry.
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
Have died had I not made it.

Bel. Whither bound?

Imo. To Milford-Haven.

Bel. What’s your name?

Imo. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
Is bound for Italy; he embark’d at Milford;
To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
I am fall’n in this offence.

Bel. Prithee, fair youth,
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter’d!
’Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
Ere you depart; and thanks to stay and eat it.
Boys, bid him welcome.

Gui. Were you a woman, youth,
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
I bid for you as I’d buy.

Arv. I’ll make it my comfort
He is a man; I’ll love him as my brother;
And such a welcome as I’d give to him
After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!
Be sprightly, for you fall ’mongst friends.

Imo. ’Mongst friends,
If brothers. [Aside] Would it had been so, that
they
Had been my father’s sons! Then had my prize
Been less, and so more equal ballasting
To thee, Posthumus.

Bel. He wrings at some distress.

Gui. Would I could free ’t!

Arv. Or I, whate’er it be,
What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!

Bel. Hark, boys.
[Whispering.]

Imo. [Aside.] Great men,
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience seal’d them—laying
by
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes—
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
I’d change my sex to be companion with them,
Since Leonatus is false.

Bel. It shall be so.
Boys, we’ll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come
in.
Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have
supp’d,
We’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
So far as thou wilt speak it.

Gui. Pray, draw near.

Arv. The night to the owl and morn to the lark
less welcome.

Imo. Thanks, sir.

Arv. I pray, draw near.
[Exeunt.]

## Scene VII. Rome: a public place

[Enter two Senators and Tribunes.]

1st Sen. This is the tenor of the Emperor’s writ:
That since the common men are now in action
’Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
And that the legions now in Gallia are
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fall’n-off Britons, that we do incite
The gentry to this business. He creates
Lucius proconsul; and to you the tribunes,
For this immediate levy, he commends
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

1st Tri. Is Lucius general of the forces?

2nd Sen. Ay.

1st Tri. Remaining now in Gallia?

1st Sen. With those legions
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
Must be suppliant. The words of your commission
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
Of their dispatch.

1st Tri. We will discharge our duty.
[Exeunt.]

# ACT IV

## Scene I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius

[Enter Cloten.]

Clo. I am near to the place where they should
meet, if Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit
his garments serve me! Why should his mistress,
who was made by him that made the tailor, not
be fit too? the rather—saving reverence of the
word—for ’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by
fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare
speak it to myself—for it is not vain-glory for a
man and his glass to confer in his own chamber—
I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as
his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him
in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the
time, above him in birth, alike conversant in gen¬
eral services, and more remarkable in single op¬
positions; yet this imperceiverant thing loves
him in my despite. What mortality is! Post¬
humus, thy head, which now is growing upon
thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces
before thy face: and all this done, spurn her home
to her father; who may haply be a little angry for
my so rough usage; but my mother, having
power of his testiness, shall turn all into my
commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out,
sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them
into my hand! This is the very description of
their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not de¬
ceive me.
[Exit.]

## Scene II. Before the cave of Belarius

[Enter, from the cave, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, and Imogen.]

Bel. [To Imogen] You are not well. Remain here
in the cave;
We’ll come to you after hunting.

Arv. [To Imogen] Brother, stay here.
Are we not brothers?

Imo. So man and man should be;
But clay and clay differs in dignity,
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

Gui. Go you to hunting; I’ll abide with him.

Imo. So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me;
Stick to your journal course. The breach of cus¬
tom
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here.
I’ll rob none but myself; and let me die,
Stealing so poorly.

Gui. I love thee; I have spoke it.
How much the quantity, the weight as much,
As I do love my father.

Bel. What! how! how!

Arv. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
In my good brother’s fault. I know not why
I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door,
And a demand who is’t shall die, I’d say,
“My father, not this youth.”

Bel. [Aside] O noble strain!
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards and base things sire
base;
Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
I’m not their father; yet who this should be,
Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
’Tis the ninth hour o’ the morn.

Arv. Brother, farewell.

Imo. I wish ye sport.

Arv. You health. So please you, sir.

Imo. [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods,
what lies I have heard!
Our courtiers say all’s savage but at court.
Experience, O, thou disprov’st report!
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
I’ll now taste of thy drug.
[Swallows some.]

Gui. I could not stir him.
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

Arv. Thus did he answer me; yet said, hereafter
I might know more.

Bel. To the field, to the field!
We’ll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.

Arv. We’ll not be long away.

Bel. Pray, be not sick,
For you must be our housewife.

Imo. Well or ill,
I am bound to you.

Bel. And shalt be ever.
[Exit Imogen, to the cave.]
This youth, howe’er distress’d, appears he hath
had
Good ancestors.

Arv. How angel-like he sings!

Gui. But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
In characters,
And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
And he her dieter.

Arv. Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
From so divine a temple, to commix
With winds that sailors rail at.

Gui. I do note
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together.

Arv. Grow, patience!
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine!

Bel. It is great morning. Come, away!—Who’s
there?

[Enter Cloten.]

Clo. I cannot find those runagates; that villain
Hath mock’d me. I am faint.

Bel. “Those runagates!”
Means he not us? I partly know him. ’Tis
Cloten, the son o’ the Queen. I fear some ambush.
I saw him not these many years, and yet
I know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws; hence!

Gui. He is but one. You and my brother search
What companies are near. Pray you, away;
Let me alone with him.
[Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus.]

Clo. Soft! What are you
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

Gui. A thing
More slavish did I ne’er than answering
A slave without a knock.

Clo. Thou art a robber,
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.

Gui. To who? to thee? What art thou? Have
not I
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
Why I should yield to thee?

Clo. Thou villain base,
Know’st me not by my clothes?

Gui. No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
Who is thy grandfather. He made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.

Clo. Thou precious varlet,
My tailor made them not.

Gui. Hence, then, and thank
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some
fool;
I am loath to beat thee.

Clo. Thou injurious thief,
Hear but my name, and tremble.

Gui. What’s thy name?

Clo. Cloten, thou villain.

Gui. Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder,
Spider,
’Twould move me sooner.

Clo. To thy further fear,
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
I am son to the Queen.

Gui. I am sorry for’t; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.

Clo. Art not afeard?

Gui. Those that I reverence those I fear, the
wise.
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

Clo. Die the death!
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
I’ll follow those that even now fled hence,
And on the gates of Lud’s-town set your heads.
Yield, rustic mountaineer.
[Exeunt, fighting.]

[Re-enter Belarius and Arviragus.]

Bel. No companies abroad?

Arv. None in the world. You did mistake him,
sure.

Bel. I cannot tell. Long is it since I saw him,
But time hath nothing blurr’d those lines of
favour
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
’Twas very Cloten.

Arv. In this place we left them.
I wish my brother make good time with him,
You say he is so fell.

Bel. Being scarce made up,
I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgement
Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.

[Re-enter Guiderius, with Cloten’s head.]

Gui. This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
There was no money in’t. Not Hercules
Could have knock’d out his brains, for he had
none.
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
My head as I do his.

Bel. What hast thou done?

Gui. I am perfect what; cut off one Cloten’s
head,
Son to the Queen, after his own report;
Who call’d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he’d take us in,
Displace our heads where—thank the gods!—
they grow,
And set them on Lud’s-town.

Bel. We are all undone.

Gui. Why, worthy father, what have we to
lose,
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
Protects not us. Then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law? What company
Discover you abroad?

Bel. No single soul
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants. Though his hu¬
mour
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
Absolute madness could so far have raved
To bring him here alone; although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
May make some stronger head; the which he
hearing—
As it is like him—might break out, and swear
He’d fetch us in; yet is’t not probable
To come alone, either he so undertaking,
Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we
fear,
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head.

Arv. Let ordinance
Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe’er,
My brother hath done well.

Bel. I had no mind
To hunt this day. The boy Fidele’s sickness
Did make my way long forth.

Gui. With his own sword,
Which he did wave against my throat, I have
ta’en
His head from him. I’ll throw’t into the creek
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.
That’s all I reck.
[Exit.]

Bel. I fear ’twill be revenged.
Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t! though
valour
Becomes thee well enough.

Arv. Would I had done’t,
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
I love thee brotherly, but envy much
Thou hast robb’d me of this deed. I would re¬
venges,
That possible strength might meet, would seek
us through
And put us to our answer.

Bel. Well, ’tis done.
We’ll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for
danger
Where there’s no profit. I prithee, to our
rock;
You and Fidele play the cooks. I’ll stay
Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
To dinner presently.

Arv. Poor sick Fidele!
I’ll willingly to him. To gain his colour
I’d let a parish of such Clotens blood,
And praise myself for charity.
[Exit.]

Bel. O thou goddess,
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon’st
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
That by the top doth take the mountain pine
And make him stoop to the vale. ’Tis wonder
That an invisible instinct should frame them
To royalty unlearn’d, honour untaught,
Civility not seen from others, valour
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
As if it had been sow’d. Yet still it’s strange
What Cloten’s being here to us portends,
Or what his death will bring us.

[Re-enter Guiderius.]

Gui. Where’s my brother?
I have sent Cloten’s clotpoll down the stream,
In embassy to his mother. His body’s hostage
For his return.

[Solemn music.]

Bel. My ingenious instrument!
Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

Gui. Is he at home?

Bel. He went hence even now.

Gui. What does he mean? since death of my
dearest mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?

Bel. Look, here he comes,
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for.

[Re-enter Arviragus, with Imogen, as dead, bearing her in his arms.]

Arv. The bird is dead
That we have made so much on. I had rather
Have skipp’d from sixteen years of age to sixty,
To have turn’d my leaping-time into a crutch,
Than have seen this.

Gui. O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when thou grew’st thyself.

Bel. O melancholy!
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made;
but I,
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
How found you him?

Arv. Stark, as you see.
Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
Not as death’s dart, being laugh’d at; his right
cheek
Reposing on a cushion.

Gui. Where?

Arv. O’ the floor;
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and
put
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose
rudeness
Answer’d my steps too loud.

Gui. Why, he but sleeps.
If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed;
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
And worms will not come to thee.

Arv. With fairest flowers
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
I’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack
The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose,
nor
The azure harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
Out-sweeten’d not thy breath. The ruddock
would,
With charitable bill—O bill, sore-shaming
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument!—bring thee all this;
Yea, and furr’d moss besides, when flowers are
none,
To winter-ground thy corse.

Gui. Prithee, have done;
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,

And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt. To the grave!

Arv. Say, where shall's lay him?

Gui. By good Euriphile, our mother.

Arv. Be 't so.
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the
ground,
As once our mother; use like note and words,
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

Gui. Cadwal,
I cannot sing. I'll weep, and word it with thee;
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.

Arv. We'll speak it, then.

Bel. Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for
Cloten
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
And though he came our enemy, remember
He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty,
rotting
Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
That angel of the world, doth make distinction
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was
princely;
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
Yet bury him as a prince.

Gui. Pray you, fetch him hither.
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
When neither are alive.

Arv. If you'll go fetch him,
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

*Exit Belarius.*

Gui. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the
east;
My father hath a reason for 't.

Arv. 'Tis true.

Gui. Come on then, and remove him.

Arv. So. Begin.

### Song

Gui. Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
Nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Arv. Fear no more the frown o' the great;
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak.
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Gui. Fear no more the lightning-flash,
Arv. Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
Gui. Fear not slander, censure rash;
Arv. Thou hast finish'd joy and moan.
Both. All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

Gui. No exorciser harm thee!
Arv. Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Gui. Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Arv. Nothing ill come near thee!
Both. Quiet consummation have;
And renowned be thy grave!

*Re-enter Belarius, with the body of Cloten.*

Gui. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay
him down.

Bel. Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight,
more.
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the
night
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
You were as flowers, now wither'd; even so
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
Come on, away; apart upon our knees.
The ground that gave them first has them again.
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

*Exeunt Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

Imo. *[Awaking]* Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven;
which is the way?
I thank you.—By yond bush?—Pray, how far
thither?
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?
I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and
sleep.
But, soft! no bedfellow!—O gods and goddesses!

*Seeing the body of Cloten.*

These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man, the care on 't. I hope I dream;
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper
And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgements, blind. Good
faith,
I tremble still with fear; but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
The dream's here still; even when I wake, it is
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
I know the shape of his leg. This is his hand;
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face—
Murder in heaven?—How!—'Tis gone. Pisanio,
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters—damn'd Pisanio—
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
where's that?
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
And left this head on. How should this be?
Pisanio?
'Tis he and Cloten. Malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant,
pregnant!
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
And cordial to me, have I not found it
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home.
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's. O!
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!

*Falls on the body.*

*Enter Lucius, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer.*

Cap. To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia,
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships.
They are in readiness.

Luc. But what from Rome?

Cap. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
That promise noble service; and they come
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
Siena's brother.

Luc. When expect you them?

Cap. With the next benefit o' the wind.

## SCENE II

Luc. This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present
numbers
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to 't. Now,
sir,
What have you dream'd of late of this war's
purpose?

Sooth. Last night the very gods show'd me a
vision—
I fasted and pray'd for their intelligence—thus.
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
From the spongy south to this part of the west,
There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which
portends—
Unless my sins abuse my divination—
Success to the Roman host.

Luc. Dream often so,
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building. How! a page!
Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
Let's see the boy's face.

Cap. He's alive, my lord.

Luc. He'll then instruct us of this body.
Young one,
Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
They crave to be demanded. Who is this
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
That, otherwise than noble nature did,
Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy
interest
In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
What art thou?

Imo. I am nothing: or if not,
Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
A very valiant Briton and a good,
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
There is no more such masters. I may wander
From east to Occident, cry out for service,
Try many, all good, serve truly, never
Find such another master.

Luc. 'Lack, good youth!
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good
friend.

Imo. Richard du Champ. *[Aside]* If I do lie and do
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
They'll pardon it.—Say you, sir?

Luc. Thy name?

Imo. Fidele, sir.

Luc. Thou dost approve thyself the very same;
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
No less beloved. The Roman Emperor's letters,
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.

Imo. I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the
gods,
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd
his grave,
And on it said a century of prayers,
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
And leaving so his service, follow you,
So please you entertain me.

Luc. Ay, good youth;
And rather father thee than master thee.
My friends,
The boy hath taught us manly duties. Let us
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
And make him with our pikes and partisans
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.
Some falls are means the happier to arise.

*Exeunt.*

## Scene III. A room in Cymbeline's palace

*Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio, and Attendants.*

Cym. Again; and bring me word how 'tis with
her. *[Exit an Attendant.]*
A fever with the absence of her son,
A madness, of which her life's in danger.
Heavens,
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
So needful for this present. It strikes me, past
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
Who needs must know of her departure and
Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
By a sharp torture.

Pis. Sir, my life is yours;
I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your
Highness,
Hold me your loyal servant.

1st Lord. Good my liege,
The day that she was missing he was here.
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
There wants no diligence in seeking him,
And will, no doubt, be found.

Cym. The time is troublesome.
*[To Pisanio]* We'll slip you for a season; but our
jealousy
Does yet depend.

1st Lord. So please your Majesty,
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
Are landed on your coast, with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen, by the Senate sent.

Cym. Now for the counsel of my son and
queen!
I am amazed with matter.

1st Lord. Good my liege,
Your preparation can affront no less
Than what you hear of. Come more, for more
you're ready.
The want is but to put those powers in motion
That long to move.

Cym. I thank you. Let's withdraw;
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us; but
We grieve at chances here. Away!

*Exeunt all but Pisanio.*

Pis. I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain. 'Tis strange.
Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
To yield me often tidings; neither know I
What is betid to Cloten; but remain
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be
true.
These present wars shall find I love my country.
Even to the note o' the King, or I'll fall in them.
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd.
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

*Exit.*

## Scene IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius

*Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

Gui. The noise is round about us.

Bel. Let us from it.

Arv. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock
it
From action and adventure?

Gui. Nay, what hope
Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.

Bel. Sons,
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure
us.
To the King's party there's no going. Newness
Of Cloten's death—we being not known, not
muster'd
Among the bands—may drive us to a render
Where we have lived, and so extort from 's that
Which we have done, whose answer would be
death
Drawn on with torture.

Gui. This is, sir, a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you,
Nor satisfying us.

Arv. It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their
eyes
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
That they will waste their time upon our note,
To know from whence we are.

Bel. O, I am known
Of many in the army. Many years,
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not
wore him
From my remembrance. And, besides, the
King
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
The certainty of this hard life; ay hopeless
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
The shrinking slaves of winter.

Gui. Than be so
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army.
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
Cannot be question'd.

Arv. By this sun that shines,
I'll thither. What thing is it that I never
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
To look upon the holy sun, to have
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
So long a poor unknown.

Gui. By heavens, I'll go.
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans!

Arv. So say I; amen.

Bel. No reason I, since of your lives you set
So slight a valuation, should reserve
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you,
boys!
If in your country wars you chance to die,
That is my bed too, lads, and there I'll lie.
Lead, lead. *[Aside]* The time seems long; their
blood thinks scorn,
Till it fly out and show them princes born.

*Exeunt.*

# ACT V

## Scene I. Britain: the Roman camp

*Enter Posthumus, with a bloody handkerchief.*

Post. Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I
wish'd
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married
ones,
If each of you should take this course, how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
Every good servant does not all commands;
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I
never
Had lived to put on this. So had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But,
alack,
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's
love,
To have them fall no more. You some permit
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
But Imogen is your own; do your best wills,
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
Against my lady's kingdom. 'Tis enough
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good
heavens,
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant; so I'll fight
Against the part I come with; so I'll die
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show.
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
The fashion, less without and more within.

*Exit.*

## Scene II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps

*Enter, from one side, Lucius, Iachimo, and the Roman Army; from the other side, the British Army; Leonatus Posthumus following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, Iachimo and Posthumus; he vanquishes and disarms Iachimo, and then leaves him.*

Iach. The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady.
The princess of this country, and the air on't
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours,
borne
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.

*Exit.*

*The battle continues; the Britons fly; Cymbeline is taken: then enter, to his rescue, Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

Bel. Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the
ground;
The lane is guarded. Nothing routs us but
The villainy of our fears. Stand, stand, and fight!

*Re-enter Posthumus, and seconds the Britons; they rescue Cymbeline, and exeunt. Then re-enter Lucius, and Iachimo, with Imogen.*

Luc. Away, boy, from the troops, and save
thyself;
For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
As war were hoodwink'd.

Iach. 'Tis their fresh supplies.

Luc. It is a day turn'd strangely. Or betimes
Let's reinforce, or fly.

*Exeunt.*

## Scene III. Another part of the field

*Enter Posthumus and a British Lord.*

Lord. Camest thou from where they made the
stand?

Post. I did;
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

Lord. I did.

Post. No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
But that the heavens fought. The king himself
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having
work
More plentiful than tools to do 't, struck down
Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some
falling
Merely through fear; that the strait pass was
damm'd
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
To die with lengthen'd shame.

Lord. Where was this lane?

Post. Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd
with turf;
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
So long a breeding as his white beard came to.
In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane,
He, with two striplings—lads more like to run
The country base than to commit such slaughter;
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
Than those for preservation cased, or shame—
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
"Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards.
Stand;
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may
save,
But to look back in frown. Stand, stand." These
three,
Three thousand confident, in act as many—
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothing—with this word "Stand,
stand,"
Accommodated by the place, more charming
With their own nobleness, which could have
turn'd
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,
turn'd coward
But by example—O, a sin in war,
Damn'd in the first beginners!—gan to look
The way that they did, and to grin like lions
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles;
slaves,
The strides they victors made. And now our
cowards,
Like fragments in hard voyages, became
The life o' the need. Having found the back-door
open
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they
wound!
Some slain before; some dying; some their
friends
O'er-borne i' the former wave. Ten, chased by
one,
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty.
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o' the field.

Lord. This was strange chance.
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

Post. Nay, do not wonder at it. You are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon 't,
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
"Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane."

Lord. Nay, be not angry, sir.

Post. 'Lack, to what end?
Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
For if he'll do as he is made to do,
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
You have put me into rhyme.

Lord. Farewell; you're angry.

Post. Still going? *[Exit Lord.]* This is a lord! O
noble misery,
To be i' the field, and ask "what news?" of me!
To-day how many would have given their
honours
To have saved their carcases! took heel to do't,
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
Could not find death where I did hear him
groan,
Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly
monster,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft
beds,
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find
him;
For being now a favourer to the Briton,
No more a Briton, I have resumed again
The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
On either side I come to spend my breath;
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
But end it by some means for Imogen.

*Enter two British Captains and Soldiers.*

1st Cap. Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is
taken.
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were
angels.

2nd Cap. There was a fourth man, in a silly
habit,
That gave the affront with them.

1st Cap. So 'tis reported;
But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's
there?

Post. A Roman,
Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
Had answer'd him.

2nd Cap. Lay hands on him; a dog!
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
his service
As if he were of note. Bring him to the King.

*Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, Soldiers, Attendants, Roman Captives. The Captains present Posthumus to Cymbeline, who delivers him over to a Gaoler; then Exeunt omnes.*

## Scene IV. A British prison

*Enter Posthumus and two Gaolers.*

1st Gaol. You shall not now be stol'n, you have
locks upon you;
So graze as you find pasture.

2nd Gaol. Ay, or a stomach.

*Exeunt Gaolers.*

Post. Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a
way,
I think, to liberty. Yet am I better
Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had
rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
By the sure physician, Death, who is the key
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art
fetter'd
More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods,
give me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
Then, free for ever! Is 't enough I am sorry?
So children temporal fathers do appease;
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
I cannot do it better than in gyves,
Desired more than constrain'd; to satisfy,
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
No stricter render of me than my all.
I know you are more clement than vile men,
Who of their broken debtors take a third,
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
On their abatement. That's not my desire.
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every
stamp;
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;
You rather mine, being yours; and so, great
powers,
If you will take this audit, take this life,
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
I'll speak to thee in silence. *[Sleeps.]*

*Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, Sicilius Leonatus, father to Posthumus, an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother to Posthumus, with music before them: then, after other music, follow the two young Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus round, as he lies sleeping.*

Sici. No more, thou thunder-master, show
Thy spite on mortal flies.
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
That thy adulteries
Rates and revenges.
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
Whose face I never saw?
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
Attending nature's law;
Whose father then, as men report
Thou orphans' father art,
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
From this earth-vexing smart.

Moth. Lucina lent not me her aid,
But took me in my throes;
That from me was Posthumus ript,
Came crying 'mongst his foes,
A thing of pity!

Sici. Great nature, like his ancestry,
Moulded the stuff so fair,
That he deserved the praise o' the world,
As great Sicilius' heir.

1st Bro. When once he was mature for man,
In Britain where was he
That could stand up his parallel;
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Imogen, that best
Could deem his dignity?

Moth. With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
To be exiled, and thrown
From Leonati's seat, and cast
From her his dearest one,
Sweet Imogen?

Sici. Why did you suffer Iachimo,
Slight thing of Italy,
To taint his nobler heart and brain
With needless jealousy;
And to become the geek and scorn
O' th' other's villainy?

2nd Bro. For this from stiller seats we came,
Our parents and us twain,
That striking in our country's cause
Fell bravely and were slain,
Our fealty and Tenantius' right
With honour to maintain.

1st Bro. Like hardiment Posthumus hath
To Cymbeline perform'd.
Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
The graces for his merits due,
Being all to dolours turn'd?

Sici. Thy crystal window ope; look out;
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries.

Moth. Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
Sici. Take off his miseries.

Sici. Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To the shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity.

Both Bro. Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
And from thy justice fly.

*Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle; he throws a thunderbolt. The Ghosts fall on their knees.*

Jup. No more, you petty spirits of region low,
Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
Upon your never-withering banks of flowers.
Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift.
His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
And happier much by his affliction made.
This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine,
And so, away! No further with your din
Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.

*Ascends.*

Sici. He came in thunder; his celestial breath
Was sulphurous to smell. The holy eagle
Stoop'd, as to foot us. His ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
As when his god is pleased.

All. Thanks, Jupiter!

Sici. The marble pavement closes, he is
enter'd
His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
Let us with care perform his great behest.

*The Ghosts vanish.*

Post. *[Waking]* Sleep, thou hast been a grand-
sire and begot
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers; but, O scorn!
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were
born.
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,

# ACT V

That have this golden chance and know not why.
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Nobler than that it covers! Let thy effects
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
As good as promise.

> [Reads] "When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty."

'Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
The action of my life is like it, which
I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

*Re-enter Gaolers.*

**First Gaoler.** Come, sir, are you ready for death?

**Posthumus.** Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

**First Gaoler.** Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for that, you are well cooked.

**Posthumus.** So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.

**First Gaoler.** A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. Of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! it sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.

**Posthumus.** I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

**First Gaoler.** Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the tooth-ache; but a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for, look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.

**Posthumus.** Yes, indeed do I, fellow.

**First Gaoler.** Your death has eyes in's head then; I have not seen him so pictured. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after inquiry on your own peril. And how you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to tell one.

**Posthumus.** I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.

**First Gaoler.** What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**Messenger.** Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.

**Posthumus.** Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.

**First Gaoler.** I'll be hang'd then.

**Posthumus.** Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.

*Exeunt all but the First Gaoler.*

**First Gaoler.** Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them too that die against their wills; so should I, if I were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in't.

*Exit.*

## Scene V. Cymbeline's tent

*Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, Lords, Officers, and Attendants.*

**Cymbeline.** Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.
He shall be happy that can find him, if
Our grace can make him so.

**Belarius.** I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
Such precious deeds in one that promised nought
But beggary and poor looks.

**Cymbeline.** No tidings of him?

**Pisanio.** He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
But no trace of him.

**Cymbeline.** To my grief, I am
The heir of his reward; [To Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus] which I will add
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
To ask of whence you are. Report it.

**Belarius.** Sir,
In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen.
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
Unless I add, we are honest.

**Cymbeline.** Bow your knees.
Arise my knights o' the battle. I create you
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates.

*Enter Cornelius and Ladies.*

There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
And not o' the court of Britain.

**Cornelius.** Hail, great king!
To sour your happiness, I must report
The queen is dead.

**Cymbeline.** Who worse than a physician
Would this report become? But I consider,
By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

**Cornelius.** With horror, madly dying, like her life,
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
I will report, so please you. These her women
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
Were present when she finish'd.

**Cymbeline.** Prithee, say.

**Cornelius.** First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
Affected greatness got by you, not you;
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
Abhorr'd your person.

**Cymbeline.** She alone knew this;
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

**Cornelius.** Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
With such integrity, she did confess
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
But that her flight prevented it, she had
Ta'en off by poison.

**Cymbeline.** O most delicate fiend!
Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?

**Cornelius.** More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
By inches waste you; in which time she purposed,
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
Her son into the adoption of the crown;
But, failing of her end by this strange absence,
Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
Despairing died.

**Cymbeline.** Heard you all this, her women?

**First Lady.** We did, so please your Highness.

**Cymbeline.** Mine eyes
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
That thought her like her seeming; it had been vicious
To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

*Enter Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; Posthumus behind, and Imogen.*

Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute; that
The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted.
So think of your estate.

**Lucius.** Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
May be call'd ransom, let it come. Sufficeth
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
Augustus lives to think on't; and so much
For my peculiar care. This one thing only
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
Let him be ransom'd. Never master had
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
So tender over his occasions, true,
So feat, so nurse-like. Let his virtue join
With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
Though he have served a Roman. Save him, sir,
And spare no blood beside.

**Cymbeline.** I have surely seen him;
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
To say "live, boy." Ne'er thank thy master; live
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
The noblest ta'en.

**Imogen.** I humbly thank your Highness.

**Lucius.** I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
And yet I know thou wilt.

**Imogen.** No, no; alack,
There's other work in hand. I see a thing
Bitter to me as death. Your life, good master,
Must shuffle for itself.

**Lucius.** The boy disdains me,
He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
Why stands he so perplexed?

**Cymbeline.** What wouldst thou, boy?
I love thee more and more. Think more and more
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak.
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

**Imogen.** He is a Roman; no more kin to me
Than I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,
Am something nearer.

**Cymbeline.** Wherefore eyest him so?

**Imogen.** I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
To give me hearing.

**Cymbeline.** Ay, with all my heart,
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

**Imogen.** Fidele, sir.

**Cymbeline.** Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
I'll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.

*Cymbeline and Imogen converse apart.*

**Belarius.** Is not this boy revived from death?

**Arviragus.** One sand another
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

**Guiderius.** The same dead thing alive.

**Belarius.** Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;
Creatures may be alike. Were't he, I am sure
He would have spoke to us.

**Guiderius.** But we saw him dead.

**Belarius.** Be silent; let's see further.

**Pisanio.** [Aside] It is my mistress.
Since she is living, let the time run on
To good or bad.

*Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.*

**Cymbeline.** Come, stand thou by our side;
Make thy demand aloud. [To Iachimo] Sir, step you forth;
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

**Imogen.** My boon is that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring.

**Posthumus.** [Aside] What's that to him?

**Cymbeline.** That diamond upon your finger, say
How came it yours?

**Iachimo.** Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

**Cymbeline.** How! me?

**Iachimo.** I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
Which torments me to conceal. By villainy
I got this ring. 'Twas Leonatus' jewel;
Whom thou didst banish; and—which more may grieve thee,
As it doth me—a nobler sir ne'er lived
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

**Cymbeline.** All that belongs to this.

**Iachimo.** That paragon, thy daughter—
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
Quail to remember—Give me leave; I faint.

**Cymbeline.** My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength.
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.

**Iachimo.** Upon a time—unhappy was the clock
That struck the hour!—it was in Rome—accursed
The mansion where!—'twas at a feast—O, would
Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
Those which I heaved to head!—the good Posthumus—
What should I say? He was too good to be
Where ill men were; and was the best of all
Amongst the rarest of good ones—sitting sadly,
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva,
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
Fairness which strikes the eye—

**Cymbeline.** I stand on fire.
Come to the matter.

**Iachimo.** All too soon I shall,
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
Most like a noble lord in love and one
That had a royal lover, took his hint;
And, not dispraising whom we praised—therein
He was as calm as virtue—he began
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,
And then a mind put in't, either our brags
Were crack'd of kitchen-trulls, or his description
Proved us unspeaking sots.

**Cymbeline.** Nay, nay, to the purpose.

**Iachimo.** Your daughter's chastity—there it begins.
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
And she alone were cold. Whereat I, wretch,
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
No lesser of her honour confident
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
And would so, had it been a carbuncle
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
Been all the worth of's care. Away to Britain
Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
Remember me at court; where I was taught
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
'Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd,
That I return'd with simular proof enough
To make the noble Leonatus mad,
By wounding his belief in her renown
With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet—
O cunning, how I got it!—nay, some marks
Of secret on her person, that he could not
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon—
Methinks, I see him now—

**Posthumus.** [Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
Egregious murderer, thief, anything
That's due to all the villains past, in being,
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out
For torturers ingenious. It is I
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
That kill'd thy daughter—villain-like, I lie—
That caused a lesser villain than myself,
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
The dogs o' the street to bay me. Every villain
Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus; and
Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen!
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
Imogen, Imogen!

**Imogen.** Peace, my lord; hear, hear—

**Posthumus.** Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful Page!
There lie thy part. [Striking her: she falls.]

**Pisanio.** O, gentlemen, help!
Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!
Mine honour'd lady!

**Cymbeline.** Does the world go round?

**Posthumus.** How come these staggers on me?

**Pisanio.** Wake, my mistress!

**Cymbeline.** If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy.

**Pisanio.** How fares my mistress?

**Imogen.** O, get thee from my sight;
Thou gavest me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!
Breathe not where princes are.

**Cymbeline.** The tune of Imogen!

**Pisanio.** Lady,
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.

**Cymbeline.** New matter still?

**Imogen.** It poison'd me.

**Cornelius.** O gods!
I left out one thing which the Queen confess'd,
Which must approve thee honest: "If Pisanio
Have," said she, "given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
As I would serve a rat."

**Cymbeline.** What's this, Cornelius?

**Cornelius.** The Queen, sir, very oft importuned me
To temper poisons for her, still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger, did compound for her
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
The present power of life, but in short time
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

**Imogen.** Most like I did, for I was dead.

**Belarius.** My boys,
There was our error.

**Guiderius.** This is, sure, Fidele.

**Imogen.** Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock; and now
Throw me again. [Embracing him.]

**Posthumus.** Hang there like fruit, my soul,
Till the tree die!

**Cymbeline.** How now, my flesh, my child!
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
Wilt thou not speak to me?

**Imogen.** [Kneeling] Your blessing sir.

**Belarius.** [To Guiderius and Arviragus] Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not;
You had a motive for't.

**Cymbeline.** My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
Thy mother's dead.

**Imogen.** I am sorry for't, my lord.

**Cymbeline.** O, she was naught; and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely. But her son
Is gone, we know not how nor where.

**Pisanio.** My lord,
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
Upon my lady's missing, came to me
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
It was my instant death. By accident,
I had a feigned letter of my master's
Then in my pocket; which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
Which he enforced from me, away he posts
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My lady's honour. What became of him
I further know not.

**Guiderius.** Let me end the story;
I slew him there.

**Cymbeline.** Marry, the gods forfend!
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
Deny't again.

**Guiderius.** I have spoke it, and I did it.

**Cymbeline.** He was a prince.

**Guiderius.** A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head;
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.

**Cymbeline.** I am sorry for thee.
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
Endure our law. Thou'rt dead.

**Imogen.** That headless man
I thought had been my lord.

**Cymbeline.** Bind the offender,
And take him from our presence.

**Belarius.** Stay, sir King.
This man is better than the man he slew,
As well descended as thyself; and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for. [To the Guard] Let his arms alone;
They were not born for bondage.

**Cymbeline.** Why, old soldier,
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
As good as we?

**Arviragus.** In that he spake too far.

**Cymbeline.** And thou shalt die for't.

**Belarius.** We will die all three,
But I will prove that two of us are as good
As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
Though, haply, well for you.

**Arviragus.** Your danger's ours.

**Guiderius.** And our good his.

**Belarius.** Have at it then, by leave.
Thou hadst, great King, a subject who
Was call'd Belarius.

**Cymbeline.** What of him? he is
A banish'd traitor.

**Belarius.** He it is that hath
Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
I know not how a traitor.

**Cymbeline.** Take him hence.
The whole world shall not save him.

**Belarius.** Not too hot.
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
As I have received it.

**Cymbeline.** Nursing of my sons!

**Belarius.** I am too blunt and saucy; here's my knee.
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
These two young gentlemen, that call me father
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
And blood of your begetting.

**Cymbeline.** How! my issue!

**Belarius.** So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes—
For such and so they are—these twenty years
Have I train'd up. Those arts they have as I
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
Upon my banishment. I moved her to't,
Having received the punishment before,
For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
Here are your sons again; and I must lose
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars.

**Cymbeline.** Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children.
If these be they, I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons.

**Belarius.** Be pleased awhile.
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius.
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
Of his queen mother, which for more probation
I can with ease produce.

**Cymbeline.** Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
It was a mark of wonder.

**Belarius.** This is he;
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
It was wise nature's end in the donation,
To be his evidence now.

**Cymbeline.** O, what, am I
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

**Imogen.** No, my lord;
I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers,
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother,
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
When ye were so indeed.

**Cymbeline.** Did you e'er meet?

**Arviragus.** Ay, my good lord.

**Guiderius.** And at first meeting loved;
Continued so, until we thought he died.

**Cornelius.** By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.

**Cymbeline.** O rare instinct!
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived you?
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
And your three motives to the battle, with
I know not how much more, should be demanded;
And all the other by-dependencies,
From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long interrogatories. See,
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
Each object with a joy; the counterchange
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
[To Belarius] Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

**Imogen.** You are my father too, and did relieve me
To see this gracious season.

**Cymbeline.** All o'erjoyed,
Save these in bonds. Let them be joy-fill'd too,
For they shall taste our comfort.

**Imogen.** My good master,
I will yet do you service.

**Lucius.** Happy be you!

**Cymbeline.** The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
He would have well become this place, and graced
The thankings of a king.

**Posthumus.** I am, sir,
The soldier that did company these three
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
Speak, Iachimo. I had you down and might
Have made you finish.

**Iachimo.** [Kneeling] I am down again;
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
Which I so often owe; but your ring first;
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith.

**Posthumus.** Kneel not to me.
The power that I have on you is to spare you;
The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,
And deal with others better.

**Cymbeline.** Nobly doom'd!
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
Pardon's the word to all.

**Arviragus.** You holp us, sir,
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
Joy'd are we that you are.

**Posthumus.** Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,
Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle-backed,
Appear'd to me, with other sprightly shows
Of mine own kindred. When I waked, I found
This label on my bosom; whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
Make no collection of it. Let him show
His skill in the construction.

**Lucius.** Philarmonus!

**Soothsayer.** Here, my good lord.

**Lucius.** Read, and declare the meaning.

**Soothsayer.** [Reads] "When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty."

Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
The fit and apt construction of thy name,
Being *leo-natus*, doth import so much.
[To Cymbeline] The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
Which we call *mollis aer*; and *mollis aer*
We term it *mulier*; which *mulier* I divine
Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
Answering the letter of the oracle,
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
With this most tender air.

**Cymbeline.** This hath some seeming.

**Soothsayer.** The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
Personates thee; and thy lopp'd branches point
Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
For many years thought dead, are now revived,
To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
Promises Britain peace and plenty.

**Cymbeline.** Well;
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
And to the Roman empire; promising
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
Have laid most heavy hand.

**Soothsayer.** The fingers of the powers above do tune
The harmony of this peace. The vision
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
So vanish'd; which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
The imperial Caesar, should again unite
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
Which shines here in the west.

**Cymbeline.** Laud we the gods;
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together. So through Lud's-town march;
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.

*Exeunt.*

## ACT I

### Scene I. Antechamber in Leontes' palace

[Enter Camillo and Archidamus.]

**Archidamus.**
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit
Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my
services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have
said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and
your Sicilia.

**Camillo.**
I think, this coming summer, the King of
Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which
he justly owes him.

**Archidamus.**
Wherein our entertainment shall shame
us we will be justified in our loves; for indeed—

**Camillo.**
Beseech you,—

**Archidamus.**
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my
knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence
—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will
give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unin¬
telligent of our insufficience, may, though they
cannot praise us, as little accuse us.

**Camillo.**
You pay a great deal too dear for what’s
given freely.

**Archidamus.**
Believe me, I speak as my understanding
instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to
utterance.

**Camillo.**
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to
Bohemia. They were trained together in their
childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then
such an affection, which cannot choose but
branch now. Since their more mature dignities
and royal necessities made separation of their
society, their encounters, though not personal,
have been royally attorney'd with interchange
of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have
seemed to be together, though absent, shook
hands, as over a vast, and embraced, as it were,
from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens
continue their loves!

**Archidamus.**
I think there is not in the world either
malice or matter to alter it. You have an un¬
speakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius.
It is a gentleman of the greatest promise
that ever came into my note.

**Camillo.**
I very well agree with you in the hopes
of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed
physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh.
They that went on crutches ere he was born
desire yet their life to see him a man.

**Archidamus.**
Would they else be content to die?

**Camillo.**
Yes; if there were no other excuse why
they should desire to live.

**Archidamus.**
If the King had no son, they would desire
to live on crutches till he had one.

[Exeunt.]

### Scene II. A room of state in the same

[Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo, and Attendants.]

**Polixenes.**
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen; time as long again
Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt; and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one “We thank you” many thousands moe
That go before it.

**Leontes.**
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part.

**Polixenes.**
Sir, that’s to-morrow.
I am question’d by my fears of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,
“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d
To tire your royalty.

**Leontes.**
We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to’t.

**Polixenes.**
No longer stay.

**Leontes.**
One seven-night longer.

**Polixenes.**
Very sooth, to-morrow.

**Leontes.**
We’ll part the time between’s then; and in that
I’ll no gainsaying.

**Polixenes.**
Press me not, beseech you, so.
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ the
world,
So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble. To save both,
Farewell, our brother.

**Leontes.**
Tongue-tied our Queen? Speak you.

**Hermione.**
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
You had drawn oaths from him not to stay.
You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim’d. Say this to him.
He’s beat from his best ward.

**Leontes.**
Well said, Hermione.

**Hermione.**
To tell him he longs to see his son were strong;
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix’d for’s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o’ the clock behind
What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?

**Polixenes.**
No, madam.

**Hermione.**
Nay, but you will?

**Polixenes.**
I may not, verily.

**Hermione.**
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the stars
with oaths,
Should yet say, “Sir, no going.” Verily,
You shall not go; a lady’s “Verily”’s
As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How
say you?
My prisoner or my guest? by your dread
“Verily,”
One of them you shall be.

**Polixenes.**
Your guest, then, madam.

**Hermione.**
To be your prisoner should import offending,
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish. Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you
Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were
boys.
You were pretty lordings then?

**Polixenes.**
We were, fair Queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

**Hermione.**
Was not my lord
The verier wag o’ the two?

**Polixenes.**
We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk
i’ the sun,
And bleat the one at the other. What we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d
With stronger blood, we should have answer’d
heaven
Boldly, “Not guilty”; the imposition clear’d
Hereditary ours.

**Hermione.**
By this we gather
You have tripp’d since.

**Polixenes.**
O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born to’s; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

**Hermione.**
Grace to boot! So,
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your Queen and I are devils. Yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we’ll answer,
If you first sinn’d with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp’d not
With any but with us.

**Leontes.**
Is he won yet?

**Hermione.**
He’ll stay, my lord.

**Leontes.**
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose.

**Hermione.**
Never?

**Leontes.**
Never, but once.

**Hermione.**
What! Have I twice said well? When
was’t before?
I prithee tell me; cram’s with praise, and make’s
As fat as tame things. One good deed dying
tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages. You may ride’s
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we eke an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay;
What was my first? It has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you. O, would her name were
Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose; when?
Nay, let me have’t; I long.

**Leontes.**
Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to
death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love. Then didst thou utter,
“I am yours for ever.”

**Hermione.**
’Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose
twice:
The one for ever earn’d a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

**Leontes.**
[Aside] Too hot, too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
I have *tremor cordis* on me; my heart dances;
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment in
May a free face put on, derive a liberty
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
And well become the agent; ’t may, I grant;
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
As now they are, and making practised smiles,
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere
The mort o’ the deer; O, that is entertainment
My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
Art thou my boy?

**Mamillius.**
Ay, my good lord.

**Leontes.**
Y’fecks!
Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutch’d
thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain.
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call’d neat.—Still virginalling
Upon his palm!—How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

**Mamillius.**
Yes, if you will, my lord.

**Leontes.**
Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots
that I have,
To be full like me; yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That will say any thing. But were they false
As o’er-dyed blacks, as waned waters, false
As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes
No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain!
Most dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be?—
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre.
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams—how can this be?—
With what’s unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou
dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

**Polixenes.**
What means Sicilia?

**Hermione.**
He something seems unsettled.

**Polixenes.**
How, my lord!
What cheer? how is’t with you, best brother?

**Hermione.**
You look
As if you held a brow of much distraction.
Are you moved, my lord?

**Leontes.**
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly.
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous.
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

**Mamillius.**
No, my lord, I’ll fight.

**Leontes.**
You will! Why, happy man be’s dole!
My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?

**Polixenes.**
If at home, sir,
He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter.
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.
He makes a July’s day short as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

**Leontes.**
So stands this squire
Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
How thou lovest us, show in our brother’s wel¬come;
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.
Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s
Apparent to my heart.

**Hermione.**
If you would seek us
We are yours i’ the garden. Shall’s attend you
there?

**Leontes.**
To your own bents dispose you; you’ll be found,
Be you beneath the sky. [Aside] I am angling
now,
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!

[Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione, and Attendants.]

Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a fork’d
one!
Go, play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave; contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There
have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in’s
absence
And his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there’s comfort
in’t
Whiles other men have gates and those gates
open’d,
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there is
none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful,
think it,
From east, west, north and south. Be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know’t;
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage. Many thousand on’s
Have the disease, and feel’t not. How now, boy!

**Mamillius.**
I am like you, they say.

**Leontes.**
Why, that’s some comfort.
What, Camillo, there?

**Camillo.**
Ay, my good lord.

**Leontes.**
Go play, Mamillius; thou’rt an honest
man.
[Exit Mamillius.]
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

**Camillo.**
You had much ado to make his anchor
hold.
When you cast out, it still came home.

**Leontes.**
Didst note it?

**Camillo.**
He would not stay at your petitions;
made
His business more material.

**Leontes.**
Didst perceive it?
[Aside] They’re here with me already, whisper¬ing, rounding,
“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone,
When I shall gust it last. How came’t, Camillo,
That he did stay?

**Camillo.**
At the good Queen’s entreaty.

**Leontes.**
At the Queen’s be’t: “good” should be
pertinent;
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks. Not noted, is’t,
But of the finer natures? By some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.

**Camillo.**
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

**Leontes.**
Ha!

**Camillo.**
Stays here longer.

**Leontes.**
Ay, but why?

**Camillo.**
To satisfy your Highness and the en¬treaties
Of our most gracious mistress.

**Leontes.**
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! Satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform’d; but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems so.

**Camillo.**
Be it forbid, my lord!

**Leontes.**
To bide upon’t, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be
counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play’d home, the rich stake
drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

**Camillo.**
My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play’d the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Whereof the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord,
Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage. If I then deny it,
’Tis none of mine.

**Leontes.**
Ha’ not you seen, Camillo—
But that’s past doubt, you have, or your eye¬glass
Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn—or heard—
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think—
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight; say’t and justify’t.

**Camillo.**
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

**Leontes.**
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible
Of breaking honesty—horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs
only,
That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that’s in’t is
nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these
nothings,
If this be nothing.

**Camillo.**
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For ’tis most dangerous.

**Leontes.**
Say it be, ’tis true.

**Camillo.**
No, no, my lord.

**Leontes.**
It is; you lie, you lie.
I say thou’rt best, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running of one glass.

**Camillo.**
Who does infect her?

**Leontes.**
Why, he that wears her like her medal,
hanging
About his neck, Bohemia; who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Which should undo more doing; ay, and thou,
His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form
Have bench’d and rear’d to worship, who mayst
see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees
heaven,
How I am galled—mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

**Camillo.**
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison; but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee—

**Leontes.**
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o’ the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

**Camillo.**
I must believe you, sir;
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for ’t;
Provided that, when he’s removed, your High¬ness
Will take again your Queen as yours at first,
Even for your son’s sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

**Leontes.**
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down.
I’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.

**Camillo.**
My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your Queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

**Leontes.**
This is all.
Do’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do’t not, thou split’st thine own.

**Camillo.**
I’ll do’t, my lord.

**Leontes.**
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised
me.
[Exit.]

**Camillo.**
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do’t
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish’d after, I’d not do’t; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villainy itself forswear’t. I must
Forsake the court. To do’t, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.

[Re-enter Polixenes.]

**Polixenes.**
This is strange; methinks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

**Camillo.**
Hail, most royal sir!

**Polixenes.**
What is the news i’ the court?

**Camillo.**
None rare, my lord.

**Polixenes.**
The King hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.

**Camillo.**
I dare not know, my lord.

**Polixenes.**
How! Dare not! Do not. Do you know,
and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: ’tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,
And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must
be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter’d with’t.

**Camillo.**
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

**Polixenes.**
How! Caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
I have look’d on thousands, who have sped the
better
By my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo—
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,
In whose success we are gentle—I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowl¬edge
Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not
In ignorant concealment.

**Camillo.**
I may not answer.

**Polixenes.**
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo?
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the
least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

**Camillo.**
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable; therefore mark my
counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow’d as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

**Polixenes.**
On, good Camillo.

**Camillo.**
I am appointed him to murder you.

**Polixenes.**
By whom, Camillo?

**Camillo.**
By the King.

**Polixenes.**
For what?

**Camillo.**
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he
swears,
As he had seen’t or been an instrument
To vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his
Queen
Forbiddenly.

**Polixenes.**
O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,
Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection
That e’er was heard or read!

**Camillo.**
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

**Polixenes.**
How should this grow?

**Camillo.**
I know not; but I am sure ’tis safer to
Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn’d, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o’ the city. For myself, I’ll put
My fortunes to your service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter’d truth; which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn’d by the King’s own mouth,
thereon
His execution sworn.

**Polixenes.**
I do believe thee;
I saw his heart in’s face. Give me thy hand.
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare,
Must it be great, and as his person’s mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour’d by a man which ever
Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
The gracious Queen, part of his theme, but
nothing
Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.

**Camillo.**
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns. Please your High¬ness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

[Exeunt.]

## ACT II

### Scene I. A room in Leontes' palace

[Enter Hermione, Mamillius, and Ladies.]

**Hermione.**
Take the boy to you; he so troubles me,
’Tis past enduring.

**First Lady.**
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?

**Mamillius.**
No, I’ll none of you.

**First Lady.**
Why, my sweet lord?

**Mamillius.**
You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

**Second Lady.**
And why so, my lord?

**Mamillius.**
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they
say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

**Second Lady.**
Who taught you this?

**Mamillius.**
I learnt it out of women’s faces. Pray
now
What colour are your eyebrows?

**First Lady.**
Blue, my lord.

**Mamillius.**
Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s
nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

**First Lady.**
Hark ye;
The Queen your mother rounds apace. We shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you’d wanton with
us,
If we would have you.

**Second Lady.**
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!

**Hermione.**
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come,
sir, now
I am for you again. Pray you, sit by us,
And tell’s a tale.

**Mamillius.**
Merry or sad shall ’t be?

**Hermione.**
As merry as you will.

**Mamillius.**
A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

**Hermione.**
Let’s have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down; come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you’re powerful
at it.

**Mamillius.**
There was a man—

**Hermione.**
Nay, come, sit down; then on.

**Mamillius.**
Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it
softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

**Hermione.**
Come on, then,
And give ’t me in mine ear.

[Enter Leontes, with Antigonus, Lords, and others.]

**Leontes.**
Was he met there? his train? Camillo
with him?

**First Lord.**
Behind the tuft of pines I met them;
never
Saw I men scour so on their way. I eyed them
Even to their ships.

**Leontes.**
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep’d, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected; but if one present
The abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his
sides,

# ACT II

With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander.
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain
Whom I employed was pre-employed by him.
He has discovered my design, and I
Remain a pinched thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?

**FIRST LORD.**
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevailed than so
On your command.

**LEONTES.**
I know't too well.
Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.

**HERMIONE.**
What is this? sport?

**LEONTES.**
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she’s big with; for ’tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.

**HERMIONE.**
But I’d say he had not,
And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe’er you lean to the nayward.

**LEONTES.**
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say “she is a goodly lady,” and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add
“'Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable.”
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use — O, I am out —
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself; these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said “She’s goodly,” come between
Ere you can say, “She’s honest.” But be't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She’s an adulteress.

**HERMIONE.**
Should a villain say so,
The most replenished villain in the world,
He were as much more villain. You, my lord,
Do but mistake.

**LEONTES.**
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing!
Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar. I have said
She’s an adulteress; I have said with whom.
More, she’s a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she’s
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give boldest titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

**HERMIONE.**
No, by my life,
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have published me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

**LEONTES.**
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy’s top. Away with her! To prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.

**HERMIONE.**
There’s some ill planet reigns.
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are, the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities; but I have no
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The King’s will be performed!

**LEONTES.**
Shall I be heard?

**HERMIONE.**
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech
your Highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause. When you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out. This action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord.
I never wished to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

**LEONTES.**
Go, do our bidding; hence!
*[Exit Queen, guarded; with ladies.]*

**FIRST LORD.**
Beseech your Highness, call the Queen again.

**ANTIGONUS.**
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

**FIRST LORD.**
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the Queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.

**ANTIGONUS.**
If it prove
She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I’ll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her, no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh is false,
If she be.

**LEONTES.**
Hold your peaces.

**FIRST LORD.**
Good my lord —

**ANTIGONUS.**
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damned for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flawed,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they’ll pay for't. By mine honour,
I’ll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations. They are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

**LEONTES.**
Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man’s nose; but I do see't and feel't,
As you feel doing thus, and see withal
The instruments that feel.

**ANTIGONUS.**
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty.
There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

**LEONTES.**
What! lack I credit?

**FIRST LORD.**
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

**LEONTES.**
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupified
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice. The matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

**ANTIGONUS.**
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

**LEONTES.**
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touched conjecture,
That lacked sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding.
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatched in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuffed sufficiency. Now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

**FIRST LORD.**
Well done, my lord.

**LEONTES.**
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

**ANTIGONUS.**
*[Aside]* To laughter, as I take it,
If the good truth were known. *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene II. A prison

*[Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants.]*

**PAULINA.**
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
Let him have knowledge who I am.
*[Exit Gentleman.]*
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost thou then in prison?

*[Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler.]*

Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?

**GAOLER.**
For a worthy lady
And one whom much I honour.

**PAULINA.**
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the Queen.

**GAOLER.**
I may not, madam.
To the contrary I have express commandment.

**PAULINA.**
Here’s ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The access of gentle visitors! Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

**GAOLER.**
So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

**PAULINA.**
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.
*[Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants.]*

**GAOLER.**
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.

**PAULINA.**
Well, be't so, prithee. *[Exit Gaoler.]*
Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.

*[Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA.]*

Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

**EMILIA.**
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together. On her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath borne greater,
She is something before her time delivered.

**PAULINA.**
A boy?

**EMILIA.**
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live. The queen receives
Much comfort in't; says “My poor prisoner,
I am innocent as you.”

**PAULINA.**
I dare be sworn.
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the King, beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall. The office
Becomes a woman best; I’ll take't upon me.
If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister
And never to my red-looked anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen.
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I’ll show't the King and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loudest. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o' the child.
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

**EMILIA.**
Most worthy madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue. There is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, I’ll presently
Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammered of this design,
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be denied.

**PAULINA.**
Tell her, Emilia,
I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let't not be doubted
I shall do good.

**EMILIA.**
Now be you blest for it!
I’ll to the Queen. Please you, come something nearer.

**GAOLER.**
Madam, if't please the Queen to send the babe,
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.

**PAULINA.**
You need not fear it, sir.
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the King nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the Queen.

**GAOLER.**
I do believe it.

**PAULINA.**
Do not you fear. Upon mine honour, I
Will stand betwixt you and danger. *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene III. A room in Leontes' palace

*[Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants.]*

**LEONTES.**
Nor night nor day no rest. It is but weakness
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The cause were not in being — part o' the cause,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me. Say that she were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again. Who’s there?

**FIRST SERVANT.**
My lord?

**LEONTES.**
How does the boy?

**FIRST SERVANT.**
He took good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

**LEONTES.**
To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,
Fastened and fixed the shame on't in himself.
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languished. Leave me solely. Go,
See how he fares. *[Exit Servant.]* Fie, fie! no
thought of him.
The very thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me. In himself too mighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow;
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.

*[Enter PAULINA, with a child.]*

**FIRST LORD.**
You must not enter.

**PAULINA.**
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the Queen’s life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

**ANTIGONUS.**
That’s enough.

**SECOND SERVANT.**
Madam, he hath not slept to-night; commanded
None should come at him.

**PAULINA.**
Not so hot, good sir.
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking. I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep.

**LEONTES.**
What noise there, ho?

**PAULINA.**
No noise, my lord; but needful conference
About some gossips for your Highness.

**LEONTES.**
How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me.
I knew she would.

**ANTIGONUS.**
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

**LEONTES.**
What, canst not rule her?

**PAULINA.**
From all dishonesty he can. In this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

**ANTIGONUS.**
La you now, you hear.
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she’ll not stumble.

**PAULINA.**
Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours. I say, I come
From your good queen.

**LEONTES.**
Good queen!

**PAULINA.**
Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

**LEONTES.**
Force her hence.

**PAULINA.**
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me. On mine own accord I’ll off;
But first I’ll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
*[Laying down the child.]*

**LEONTES.**
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!

**PAULINA.**
Not so.
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I’ll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

**LEONTES.**
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

**PAULINA.**
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

**LEONTES.**
He dreads his wife.

**PAULINA.**
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You’d call your children yours.

**LEONTES.**
A nest of traitors!

**ANTIGONUS.**
I am none, by this good light.

**PAULINA.**
Nor I, nor any
But one that’s here, and that’s himself, for he
The sacred honour of himself, his queen’s,
His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will not —
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compelled to't — once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

**LEONTES.**
A callet
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes.
Hence with it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

**PAULINA.**
It is yours;
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of his frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger.
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
Her children not her husband’s!

**LEONTES.**
A gross hag!
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hanged,
That wilt not stay her tongue.

**ANTIGONUS.**
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

**LEONTES.**
Once more, take her hence.

**PAULINA.**
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

**LEONTES.**
I’ll ha' thee burnt.

**PAULINA.**
I care not.
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I’ll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

**LEONTES.**
On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!

**PAULINA.**
I pray you, do not push me; I’ll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours. Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so; farewell; we are gone. *[Exit.]*

**LEONTES.**
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child? Away with't! Even thou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.

**ANTIGONUS.**
I did not, sir.
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

**LORDS.**
We can. My royal liege,
He is not guilty of her coming hither.

**LEONTES.**
You’re liars all.

**FIRST LORD.**
Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

**LEONTES.**
I am a feather for each wind that blows.
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? Better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard’s life — for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard’s grey — what will you adventure
To save this brat’s life?

**ANTIGONUS.**
Anything, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose; at least thus much:
I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent. Anything possible.

**LEONTES.**
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

**ANTIGONUS.**
I will, my lord!

**LEONTES.**
Mark and perform it, see'st thou? for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

**ANTIGONUS.**
I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe.
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemned to loss!
*[Exit with the child.]*

**LEONTES.**
No, I’ll not rear
Another’s issue.

*[Enter a Servant.]*

**SERVANT.**
Please your Highness, posts
From those you sent to the oracle are come
An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the court.

**FIRST LORD.**
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.

**LEONTES.**
Twenty three days
They have been absent. 'Tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,
And think upon my bidding. *[Exeunt.]*

# ACT III

### Scene I. A sea-port in Sicilia

*[Enter CLEOMENES and DION.]*

**CLEOMENES.**
The climate’s delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

**DION.**
I shall report,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

**CLEOMENES.**
But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove’s thunder, so surprised my sense
That I was nothing.

**DION.**
If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the Queen — O be't so! —
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on't.

**CLEOMENES.**
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

**DION.**
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business. When the oracle,
Thus by Apollo’s great divine sealed up,
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go, fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue! *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene II. A court of Justice

*[Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers.]*

**LEONTES.**
This session, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

**OFFICER.**
It is his Highness’ pleasure that the Queen
Appear in person here in court. Silence!

*[Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending.]*

**LEONTES.**
Read the indictment.

**OFFICER.**
*[Reads]* “Hermione, Queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night.”

**HERMIONE.**
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say “Not guilty.” Mine integrity,
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And played to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare; for honour,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strained to appear thus; if one jot beyond
The bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, hardened be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my nearest of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

**LEONTES.**
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.

**HERMIONE.**
That’s true enough;
Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

**LEONTES.**
You will not own it.

**HERMIONE.**
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded;
Which not to have done I think had been in me

Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoken,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how. All I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

Leon. You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

Hermione. Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not.
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

Leon. Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame—
Those of your fact are so—so past all truth,
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it—which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it—so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

Hermione. Sir, spare your threats.
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity.
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort,
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder; myself on every post
Proclaim'd a strumpet; with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limb. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this; mistake me not; no life, no,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigour and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle.
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord. This your request
Is altogether just; therefore bring forth,
And in Apollo's name, his oracle.
[*Exeunt certain Officers.*]

Hermione. The Emperor of Russia was my father.
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!

Re-enter *Officers, with Cleomenes and Dion.*

Off. You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
This seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest, and that since then
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

Cleo. Dion. All this we swear.

Leon. Break up the seals and read.

Off. [*Reads*]
> Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not found.

Lords. Now blessed be the great Apollo!

Hermione. Praised!

Leon. Hast thou read truth?

Off. Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

Leon. There is no truth at all i' the oracle.
The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.

Enter *Servant.*

Serv. My lord the King, the King!

Leon. What is the business?

Serv. O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Of the Queen's speed, is gone.

Leon. How! gone!

Serv. Is dead.

Leon. Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice. [*Hermione swoons.*]
How now there!

Paulina. This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down
And see what death is doing.

Leon. Take her hence.

## SCENE II

### THE WINTER'S TALE

Her heart is but overcharged; she will recover.
I have too much believed mine own suspicion.
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
[*Exeunt Paulina and Ladies, with Hermione.*]
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes; which had been done,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing't and being done. He, most humane
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practice, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all incertainties himself commended,
No richer than his honour. How he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his piety
Does my deeds make the blacker!

Re-enter *Paulina.*

Paulina. Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too!

First Lord. What fit is this, good lady?

Paulina. What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful; nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
To have him kill a king; poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by; whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't;
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam; this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last—O lords,
When I have said, cry “woe!”—the Queen, the Queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord. The higher powers forbid!

Paulina. I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

Leontes. Go on, go on;
Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord. Say no more.
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' the boldness of your speech.

Paulina. I am sorry for't.
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman; he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.
The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!—
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

Leontes. Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son.
One grave shall be for both; upon them shall
The causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation. So long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows. [*Exeunt.*]

## SCENE III. Bohemia: a desert country near the sea

Enter *Antigonus* with a Child, and a Mariner.

Antigonus. Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner. Ay, my lord; and fear
We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon's.

Antigonus. Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark. I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

Mariner. Make your best haste, and go not to
Too far i' the land; 'tis like to be loud weather.
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Of prey that keep upon't.

Antigonus. Go thou away.
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner. I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business. [*Exit.*]

Antigonus. Come, poor babe.
I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the dead
May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming. In pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts; the fury spent, anon
Did this break from her: "Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia;
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business,
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more." And so, with shrieks,
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys;
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character; there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
[*Laying down the babe, with a paper and a bundle.*]
And still rest thine. The storm begins. Poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more; thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough. I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever. [*Exit, pursued by a bear.*]

Enter a Shepherd.

Shepherd. I would there were no age between sixteen and three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting—Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master: if anywhere I have them, 'tis by the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy will! what have we here? Mercy on's, a bairn; a very pretty bairn! A boy or a girl, I wonder? A pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape. Though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work; they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for pity; yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Enter a Clown.

Clown. Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd. What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What ailest thou, man?

Clown. I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point.

Shepherd. Why, boy, how is it?

Clown. I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! but that's not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you'd thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land-service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned it; but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.

Shepherd. Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown. Now, now; I have not winked since I saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman. He's at it now.

Shepherd. Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown. I would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her; there your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd. Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, boy. Now bless thyself; thou mettest with things dying, I with things new-born. Here's a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy; open 't. So, let's see. It was told me I should be rich by the fairies. This is some changeling; open 't. What's within, boy?

Clown. You're a made old man; if the sins of your youth are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd. This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so. Up with't, keep it close. Home, home, the next way. We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good boy, the next way home.

Clown. Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are never cursed but when they are hungry. If there be any of him left, I'll bury it.

Shepherd. That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the sight of him.

Clown. Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd. 'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't. [*Exeunt.*]

## ACT IV

### Scene I.

Enter *Time*, the Chorus.

Time. I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now received. I witness to
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As you had slept between. Leontes leaving,
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
In fair Bohemia; and remember well,
I mentioned a son o' the King's, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering. What of her ensues
I list not prophesy; but let Time's news
Be known when 'tis brought forth. A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may. [*Exit.*]

### Scene II. Bohemia: the palace of Polixenes

Enter *Polixenes* and *Camillo*.

Polixenes. I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate. 'Tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this.

Camillo. It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to think so, which is another spur to my departure.

Polixenes. As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough considered, as too much I cannot, to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.

Camillo. Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have missingly noted, he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

Polixenes. I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

Camillo. I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

Polixenes. That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

Camillo. I willingly obey your command.

Polixenes. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves. [*Exeunt.*]

### Scene III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage

Enter *Autolycus*, singing.

Autolycus.
> When daffodils begin to peer,
> With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
> Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
> For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
>
> The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
> With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
> Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
> For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
>
> The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
> With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
> Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
> While we lie tumbling in the hay.

I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore three-pile; but now I am out of service.

> But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
> The pale moon shines by night:
> And when I wander here and there,
> I then do most go right.
>
> If tinkers may have leave to live,
> And bear the sow-skin budget,
> Then my account I well may give,
> And in the stocks avouch it.

My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway; beating and hanging are terrors to me; for the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A prize! a prize!

Enter a Clown.

Clown. Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?

Autolycus. [*Aside.*] If the springe hold, the cock's mine.

Clown. I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants, rice—what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies; mace; dates?—none, that's out of my note; nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o' the sun.

Autolycus. O that ever I was born!
[*Grovelling on the ground.*]

Clown. I' the name of me—

Autolycus. O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!

Clown. Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather than have these off.

Autolycus. O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.

Clown. Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter.

Autolycus. I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon me.

Clown. What, by a horseman, or a footman?

Autolycus. A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown. Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee. If this be a horseman's coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee. Come, lend me thy hand.

Autolycus. O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown. Alas, poor soul!

Autolycus. O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my shoulder-blade is out.

Clown. How now! canst stand?

Autolycus. [*Picking his pocket.*] Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me a charitable office.

Clown. Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

Autolycus. No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir. I have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or anything I want. Offer me no money, I pray you; that kills my heart.

Clown. What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

Autolycus. A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of the Prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown. His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but abide.

Autolycus. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.

Clown. Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig. He haunts wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

Autolycus. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that put me into this apparel.

Clown. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him, he'd have run.

Autolycus. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant him.

Clown. How do you now?

Autolycus. Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and walk. I will even take my leave of you, and pace softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown. Shall I bring thee on the way?

Autolycus. No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown. Then fare thee well. I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.

Autolycus. Prosper you, sweet sir! [*Exit Clown.*] Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue!
[*Singing.*]
> Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
> And merrily hent the stile-a;
> A merry heart goes all the day,
> Your sad tires in a mile-a.
[*Exit.*]

### Scene IV. The Shepherd's cottage

Enter *Florizel* and *Perdita*.

Florizel. These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life; no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

Perdita. Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me.
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up. But that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

Florizel. I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.

Perdita. Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did. O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?

Florizel. Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

Perdita. O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the King.
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,
Or I my life.

Florizel. Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor anything to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with anything
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming.
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day

Florizel. She would to each one sip. You are retired.

# THE WINTER'S TALE

## SCENE IV

**Per.** Of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come.

**Per.** O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

**Flo.** See, your guests approach.
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let’s be red with mirth.

*Enter Shepherd, Clown, Mopsa, Dorcas, and others, with Polixenes and Camillo disguised.*

**Shep.** Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This day she was both pander, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o’ the table, now i’ the middle,
On his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting. Pray you, bid
These unknown friends to ’s welcome; for it is
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o’ the feast. Come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flock shall prosper.

**Per.** [To Polixenes] Sir, welcome.
It is my father’s will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o’ the day. [To Camillo] You’re welcome, sir.
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep
Seeming and savour all the winter long.
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
And welcome to our shearing!

**Pol.** Shepherdess —
A fair one are you — well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter.

**Per.** Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer’s death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ the season
Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,
Which some call Nature’s bastards. Of that kind
Our rustic garden’s barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

**Pol.** Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

**Per.** For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating Nature.

**Pol.** Say there be;
Yet Nature is made better by no mean;
But Nature makes that mean; so, over that art
Which you say adds to Nature, is an art
That Nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race. This is an art
Which does mend Nature, change it rather; but
The art itself is Nature.

**Per.** So it is.

**Pol.** Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

**Per.** I’ll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say ’twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram;
The marigold that goes to bed wi’ the sun
And with him rises weeping. These are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.

**Cam.** I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

**Per.** Out, alas! no:
You’d be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through. Now, my fairest friend,
I would I had some flowers o’ the spring that might
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let’st fall
From Dis’s waggon! daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes
Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses,
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength — a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and, my sweet friend,
To strew him o’er and o’er!

**Flo.** What, like a corse?

**Per.** No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers.
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

**Flo.** What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
I’d have you do it ever. When you sing,
I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you
A wave o’ the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function. Each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

**Per.** O Doricles,
Your praises are too large. But that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through ’t,
Do plainly give you out an unstain’d shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You woo’d me the false way.

**Flo.** I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to ’t. But come; our dance, I pray.
Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

**Per.** I’ll swear for ’em.

**Pol.** This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself,
Too noble for this place.

**Cam.** He tells her something
That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream.

**Clo.** Come on, strike up!

**Dor.** Mopsa must be your mistress; marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!

**Mop.** Now, in good time!

**Clo.** Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!

*Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses.*

**Pol.** Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

**Shep.** They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding; but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter.
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he’ll stand and read
As ’twere my daughter’s eyes; and, to be plain,
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

**Pol.** She dances featly.

**Shep.** So she does anything; though I report it,
That should be silent. If young Doricles
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of.

*Enter Servant.*

**Serv.** O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at
the door, you would never dance again after a
tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you.
He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money;
he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s
ears grew to his tunes.

**Clo.** He could never come better; he shall come in.
I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

**Serv.** He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes;
no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves.
He has the prettiest love-songs for maids;
so without bawdry, which is strange; with such
delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, “jump
her and thump her”; and where some stretch-mouthed
rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break
a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to
answer “Whoop, do me no harm good man”;
puts him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me
no harm, good man.”

**Pol.** This is a brave fellow.

**Clo.** Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable
conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

**Serv.** He hath ribbons of all the colours i’ the rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns. Why, he
sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on ’t.

**Clo.** Prithee bring him in; and let him approach
singing.

**Per.** Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous
words in ’s tunes. [Exit Servant.]

**Clo.** You have of these pedlars, that have more
in them than you’d think, sister.

**Per.** Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

*Enter Autolycus, singing.*

> Lawn as white as driven snow;
> 
> Cyprus black as e’er was crow;
> 
> Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
> 
> Masks for faces and for noses;
> 
> Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
> 
> Perfume for a lady’s chamber;
> 
> Golden quoifs and stomachers,
> 
> For my lads to give their dears;
> 
> Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
> 
> What maids lack from head to heel.
> 
> Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
> 
> Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry.
> 
> Come buy.

**Clo.** If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

**Mop.** I was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.

**Dor.** He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

**Mop.** He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe he has paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

**Clo.** Is there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whispering. Clamour your tongues, and not a word more.

**Mop.** I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace and a pair of sweet gloves.

**Clo.** Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money?

**Aut.** And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to be wary.

**Clo.** Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

**Aut.** I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

**Clo.** What hast here? ballads?

**Mop.** Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print o’ life, for then we are sure they are true.

**Aut.** Here’s one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed.

**Mop.** Is it true, think you?

**Aut.** Very true, and but a month old.

**Dor.** Bless me from marrying a usurer!

**Aut.** Here’s the midwife’s name to ’t, one Mistress Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

**Mop.** Pray you now, buy it.

**Clo.** Come on, lay it by, and let’s first see moe ballads. We’ll buy the other things anon.

**Aut.** Here’s another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful and as true.

**Dor.** Is it true too, think you?

**Aut.** Five justices’ hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold.

**Clo.** Lay it by too. Another.

**Aut.** This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

**Mop.** Let’s have some merry ones.

**Aut.** Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “Two maids wooing a man.” There’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it; ’tis in request, I can tell you.

**Mop.** We can both sing it. If thou’lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.

**Dor.** We had the tune on ’t a month ago.

**Aut.** I can bear my part; you must know ’tis my occupation; have at it with you.

*Song.*

**Aut.**
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

**Dor.** Whither? **Mop.** O, whither? **Dor.** Whither?

**Mop.**
It becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.

**Dor.**
Me too, let me go thither.

**Mop.**
Or thou goest to the grange or mill.

**Dor.**
If to either, thou dost ill.

**Aut.** Neither. **Dor.** What, neither? **Aut.** Neither.

**Dor.** Thou hast sworn my love to be.

**Mop.** Thou hast sworn it more to me.

Then whither goest? say, whither?

**Clo.** We’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first choice. Follow me, girls. [Exit with Dorcas and Mopsa.]

**Aut.** And you shall pay well for ’em.

*Follows singing.*

> Will you buy any tape,
> 
> Or lace for your cape,
> 
> My dainty duck, my dear-a?
> 
> Any silk, any thread,
> 
> Any toys for your head,
> 
> Of the new’st and finest, finest wear-a?
> 
> Come to the pedlar;
> 
> Money’s a medler,
> 
> That doth utter all men’s ware-a.

[Exit.]

*Re-enter Servant.*

**Serv.** Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair, they call themselves Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in ’t; but they themselves are o’ the mind, if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling, it will please plentifully.

**Shep.** Away! we’ll none on ’t. Here has been too much homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

**Pol.** You weary those that refresh us. Pray, let’s see these four threes of herdsmen.

**Serv.** One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the King; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squire.

**Shep.** Leave your prating. Since these good men are pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

*Servant exits.*

*Here a dance of twelve Satyrs.*

**Pol.** O father, you’ll know more of that hereafter. [To Camillo] Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to part them. He’s simple and tells much. [To Florizel] How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks. I would have ransack’d
The pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

**Flo.** Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are.
The gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d snow that’s bolted
By the northern blasts twice o’er.

**Pol.** What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out.
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.

**Flo.** Do, and be witness to ’t.

**Pol.** And this my neighbour too?

**Flo.** And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

**Pol.** Fairly offer’d.

**Cam.** This shows a sound affection.

**Shep.** But, my daughter,
Say you the like to him?

**Per.** I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better.
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

**Shep.** Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t.
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.

**Flo.** O, that must be
I’ the virtue of your daughter. One being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us ’fore these witnesses.

**Shep.** Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

**Pol.** Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?

**Flo.** I have; but what of him?

**Pol.** Knows he of this?

**Flo.** Neither does nor shall.

**Pol.** Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak?
Hear? know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?

**Flo.** No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

**Pol.** By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial. Reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

**Flo.** I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

**Pol.** Let him know’t.

**Flo.** He shall not.

**Pol.** Prithee, let him.

**Flo.** No, he must not.

**Shep.** Let him, my son. He shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.

**Flo.** Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

**Pol.** Mark your divorce, young sir.

*Discovering himself.*

Whom son I dare not call. Thou art too base
To be acknowledged. Thou a sceptre’s heir,
That thus affect’st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with—

**Shep.** O, my heart!

**Pol.** I’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt, we’ll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words.
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment—
Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too,
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
Unworthy thee—if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
As thou art tender to ’t. [Exit.]

**Per.** Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will’t please you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,
Of your own state take care. This dream of mine—
Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

**Cam.** Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

**Shep.** I cannot speak, nor think,
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
To lie close by his honest bones; but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That knew’st this was the Prince, and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire. [Exit.]

**Flo.** Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d,
But nothing alter’d. What I was, I am;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

**Cam.** Gracious my lord,
You know your father’s temper. At this time
He will allow no speech, which, I do guess,
You do not purpose to him; and, as hardly,
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear.
Then, till the fury of his Highness settle,
Come not before him.

**Flo.** I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

**Cam.** Even he, my lord.

**Per.** How often have I told you ’twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till ’twere known!

**Flo.** It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let Nature crush the sides o’ the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

**Cam.** Be advised.

**Flo.** I am, and by my fancy. If my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

**Cam.** This is desperate, sir.

**Flo.** So call it, but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean’d, for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound seas hide
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved; therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend,
When he shall miss me—as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more—cast your good counsels
Upon his passion. Let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver: I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

**Cam.** O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

**Flo.** Hark, Perdita. [Drawing her aside.] I’ll hear you by and by.

**Cam.** He’s irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

**Flo.** Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

**Cam.** Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i’ the love
That I have borne your father?

**Flo.** Very nobly
Have you deserved. It is my father’s music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.

**Cam.** Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the King
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction.
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your Highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There’s no disjunction to be made, but by—
As heavens forfend!—your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

**Flo.** How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.

**Cam.** Have you thought on
A place whereto you’ll go?

**Flo.** Not any yet;
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

**Cam.** Then list to me.
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes.
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As ’twere i’ the father’s person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him
’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

**Flo.** Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

**Cam.** Sent by the King your father
To greet him and to give him comforts, sir.
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down;
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father’s bosom there
And speak his very heart.

**Flo.** I am bound to you.
There is some sap in this.

**Cam.** A course more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides you know
Prosperity’s the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

**Per.** One of these is true.
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

**Cam.** Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father’s house these seven years
Be born another such.

**Flo.** My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as is
She is i’ the rear of our birth.

**Cam.** I cannot say ’tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach.

**Per.** Your pardon, sir; for this
I’ll blush you thanks.

**Flo.** My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

**Cam.** My lord,
Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there. It shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

*They talk aside.*

*Re-enter Autolycus.*

**Aut.** Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenches’ song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of...

lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival
purses; and had not the old man come in with a
whoo-bub against his daughter and the King’s
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had
not left a purse alive in the whole army. 630

*Camillo, Florizel, and Perdita come forward.*

**Camillo:** Nay, but my letters, by this means being
there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

**Florizel:** And those that you’ll procure from King
Leontes —

**Camillo:** Shall satisfy your father.

**Perdita:** Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

**Camillo:** Who have we here?
*Seeing Autolycus.*
We’ll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

**Autolycus:** If they have overheard me now, why,
hanging. 639

**Camillo:** How now, good fellow! why shakest
thou so? Fear not, man; here’s no harm in-
tended to thee.

**Autolycus:** I am a poor fellow, sir.

## SCENE IV

**Camillo:** Why, be so still; here's nobody will
steal that from thee. Yet for the outside of thy
poverty we must make an exchange; therefore
disguise thee instantly — thou must think there's
a necessity in’t — and change garments with this
gentleman. Though the pennyworth on his side
be the worse, yet hold thee, there’s some boot.

**Autolycus:** I am a poor fellow, sir. [*Aside*] I know
ye well enough.

**Camillo:** Nay, prithee, dispatch. The gentleman is
half flayed already.

**Autolycus:** Are you in earnest, sir? [*Aside*] I smell
the trick on’t.

**Florizel:** Dispatch, I prithee.

**Autolycus:** Indeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot
with conscience take it.

**Camillo:** Unbuckle, unbuckle. 660

*Florizel and Autolycus exchange garments.*
Fortunate mistress! — let my prophecy
Come home to ye! — you must retire yourself
Into some covert. Take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may —
For I do fear eyes over — to shipboard
Get undescried.

**Perdita:** I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.

**Camillo:** No remedy. 669
Have you done there?

**Florizel:** Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

**Camillo:** Nay, you shall have no hat.
*Giving it to Perdita.*
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

**Autolycus:** Adieu, sir.

**Florizel:** O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

**Camillo:** [*Aside*] What I do next shall be to tell
the King
Of this escape and whither they are bound;
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after; in whose company
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
I have a woman's longing.

**Florizel:** Fortune speed us! 680
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

**Camillo:** The swifter speed the better.

*Exeunt Florizel, Perdita, and Camillo.*

**Autolycus:** I understand the business, I hear it. To
have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble
hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose
is requisite also, to smell out work for the other
senses. I see this is the time that the unjust
man doth thrive. What an exchange had this
been without boot! What a boot is here with
this exchange! Sure the gods do this year
connive at us, and we may do anything ex-
tempore. The Prince himself is about a piece
of iniquity, stealing away from his father with
his clog at his heels. If I thought it were a piece
of honesty to acquaint the King withal, I would
not do 't. I hold it the more knavery to con-
ceal it; and therein am I constant to my pro-
fession.

*Re-enter Clown and Shepherd.*

Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot
brain. Every lane's end, every shop, church, ses-
sion, hanging, yields a careful man work. 701

**Clown:** See, see; what a man you are now! There
is no other way but to tell the King she's a
changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

**Shepherd:** Nay, but hear me.

**Clown:** Nay but hear me.

**Shepherd:** Go to, then. 708

**Clown:** She being none of your flesh and blood,
your flesh and blood has not offended the King;
and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished
by him. Show those things you found about
her, those secret things, all but what she has
with her. This being done, let the law go whistle.
I warrant you.

**Shepherd:** I will tell the King all, every word,
yea, and his son’s pranks too; who, I may say,
is no honest man, neither to his father nor to
me, to go about to make me the King’s brother-
in-law. 720

**Clown:** Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest
off you could have been to him and then your
blood had been the dearer by I know how much
an ounce.

**Autolycus:** [*Aside*] Very wisely, puppies!

**Shepherd:** Well, let us to the King. There is that
in this fardel will make him scratch his beard.

**Autolycus:** [*Aside*] I know not what impediment
this complaint may be to the flight of my master.

**Clown:** Pray heartily he be at the palace. 730

**Autolycus:** [*Aside*] Though I am not naturally
honest, I am so sometimes by chance. Let me
pocket up my pedlar’s excrement. [*Takes off
his false beard.*] How now, rustics! whither are
you bound?

**Shepherd:** To the palace, an it like your worship.

**Autolycus:** Your affairs there, what, with whom, the
condition of that fardel, the place of your dwell-
ing, your names, your ages, of what having,
breeding, and anything that is fitting to be
known, discover.

**Clown:** We are but plain fellows, sir.

**Autolycus:** A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me
have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen.
