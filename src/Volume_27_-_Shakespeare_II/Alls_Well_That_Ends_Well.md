## ACT I

### Scene i. Rousillon: the Count's palace

*Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rousillon, Helena, and Lafeu, all in black.*

**Count.** In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

**Ber.** And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

**Laf.** You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.

**Count.** What hope is there of his Majesty’s amendment?

**Laf.** He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.

**Count.** This young gentlewoman had a father—O, that “had”! how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the King’s sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the King’s disease.

**Laf.** How called you the man you speak of, madam?

**Count.** He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

**Laf.** He was excellent indeed, madam. The King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.

**Ber.** What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?

**Laf.** A fistula, my lord.

**Ber.** I heard not of it before.

**Laf.** I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

**Count.** His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

**Laf.** Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

**Count.** ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it.

**Hel.** I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

**Laf.** Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.

**Count.** If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.

**Ber.** Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

**Laf.** How understand we that?

**Count.** Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,
But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

**Laf.** He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.

**Count.** Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
*Exit.*

**Ber.** [To Helena] The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.

**Laf.** Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit of your father.
*Exeunt Bertram and Lafeu.*

**Hel.** O, were that all! I think not on my father;
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him. My imagination
Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.
I am undone; there is no living, none,
If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it, he is so above me.
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself.
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,
To see him every hour; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
In our heart’s table; heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

*Enter Parolles.*

[Aside] One that goes with him. I love him for his sake; no,
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him,
That they take place, when virtue’s steely bones
Look bleak i’ the cold wind. Withal, full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

**Par.** Save you, fair queen!

**Hel.** And you, monarch!

**Par.** No.

**Hel.** And no.

**Par.** Are you meditating on virginity?

**Hel.** Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?

**Par.** Keep him out.

**Hel.** But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.

**Par.** There is none. Man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.

**Hel.** Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men?

**Par.** Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion; away with ’t!

**Hel.** I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

**Par.** There’s little can be said in ’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin. Virginity murders itself; and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by ’t. Out with ’t! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with ’t!

**Hel.** How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

**Par.** Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with ’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion; richly suited, but unsuitable; just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it?

**Hel.** Not my virginity yet.
There shall your master have a thousand loves,
A mother and a mistress and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
His humble ambition, proud humility,
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
Of pretty, fond, adoptious Christendoms,
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he—
I know not what he shall. God send him well!
The court’s a learning place, and he is one—

**Par.** What one, i’ faith?

**Hel.** That I wish well. ’Tis pity—

**Par.** What’s pity?

**Hel.** That wishing well had not a body in’t,
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
Might with effects of them follow our friends,
And show what we alone must think, which never
Returns us thanks.

*Enter Page.*

**Page.** Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
*Exit.*

**Par.** Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.

**Hel.** Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

**Par.** Under Mars, I.

**Hel.** I especially think, under Mars.

**Par.** Why under Mars?

**Hel.** The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.

**Par.** When he was predominant.

**Hel.** When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

**Par.** Why think you so?

**Hel.** You go so much backward when you fight.

**Par.** That’s for advantage.

**Hel.** So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

**Par.** I am so full of business, I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So farewell.
*Exit.*

**Hel.** Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
To show her merit that did miss her love?
The King’s disease—my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix’d and will not leave me.
*Exit.*

### Scene ii. Paris: the King’s palace

*Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters, Lords, and divers attendants.*

**King.** The Florentines and Sienese are by the ears,
Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
A braving war.

**1st Lord.** So ’tis reported, sir.

**King.** Nay, ’tis most credible; we here receive it
A certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,
With caution that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial.

**1st Lord.** His love and wisdom,
Approved so to your Majesty, may plead
For amplest credence.

**King.** He hath arm’d our answer,
And Florence is denied before he comes.
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
To stand on either part.

**2nd Lord.** It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry who are sick
For breathing and exploit.

*Enter Bertram, Lafeu, and Parolles.*

**1st Lord.** It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
Young Bertram.

**King.** Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

**Ber.** My thanks and duty are your Majesty’s.

**King.** I would I had that corporal soundness now,
As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership! He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
But on us both did haggish age steal on
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
To talk of your good father. In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour
So like a courtier. Contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak, and at this time
His tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him
He used as creatures of another place
And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,
Making them proud of his humility,
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times;
Which, follow’d well, would demonstrate them now
But goers backward.

**Ber.** His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.

**King.** Would I were with him! He would always say—
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,
To grow there and to bear—“Let me not live”—
This is good melancholy oft began,
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
When it was out—“Let me not live,” quoth he,
“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.
I after him do after him wish too,
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
To give some labourers room.

**2nd Lord.** You are loved, sir;
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

**King.** I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,
Since the physician at your father’s died?
He was much famed.

**Ber.** Some six months since, my lord.

**King.** If he were living, I would try him yet.
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
With several applications. Nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
My son’s no dearer.

**Ber.** Thank your Majesty.
*Exeunt. Flourish.*

### Scene iii. Rousillon: The Count's palace

*Enter Countess, Steward, and Clown.*

**Count.** I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

**Stew.** Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.

**Count.** What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe. ’Tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.

**Clo.** ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

**Count.** Well, sir.

**Clo.** No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned; but, if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.

**Count.** Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

**Clo.** I do beg your good will in this case.

**Count.** In what case?

**Clo.** In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o’ my body; for they say barnes are blessings.

**Count.** Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

**Clo.** My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

**Count.** Is this all your worship’s reason?

**Clo.** Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.

**Count.** May the world know them?

**Clo.** I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.

**Count.** Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

**Clo.** I am out o’ friends, madam; and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.

**Count.** Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

**Clo.** You’re shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to eat the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome’er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may joul horns together, like any deer i’ the herd.

**Count.** Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?

**Clo.** A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
“For I the ballad will repeat,
Which men full true shall find;
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Your cuckoo sings by kind.”

**Count.** Get you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.

**Stew.** May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you. Of her I am to speak.

**Count.** Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen, I mean.

**Clo.** [Sings]
“Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Fond done, done fond,
Was this King Priam’s joy?
With that she sighed as she stood,
With that she sighed as she stood,
And gave this sentence then;
Among nine bad if one be good,
Among nine bad if one be good,
There’s yet one good in ten.”

**Count.** What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.

**Clo.** One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o’ the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! we’d find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a’! And we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’t would mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out, ere a’ pluck one.

**Count.** You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

**Clo.** That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
*Exit.*

**Count.** Well, now.

**Stew.** I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

**Count.** Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand.

**Stew.** Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.

**Count.** You have discharged this honestly; keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you, leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.
*Exit Steward.*

*Enter Helena.*

**Count.** Even so it was with me when I was young.
If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,
Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth.
By our remembrances of days foregone,
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
Her eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.

**Hel.** What is your pleasure, madam?

**Count.** You know, Helen,
I am a mother to you.

**Hel.** Mine honourable mistress.

**Count.** Nay, a mother.
Why not a mother? When I said “a mother,”
Methought you saw a serpent: what’s in “mother,”
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan
Yet I express to you a mother’s care.
God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,
That this distemper’d messenger of wet,
The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?
Why? that you are my daughter?

**Hel.** That I am not.

**Count.** I say, I am your mother.

**Hel.** Pardon, madam;
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother.
I am from humble, he from honour’d name;
No note upon my parents, his all noble.
My master, my dear lord he is; and I
His servant live, and will his vassal die.
He must not be my brother.

**Count.** Nor I your mother?

**Hel.** You are my mother, madam; would you were—
So that my lord your son were not my brother—
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
I care no more for than I do for heaven,
So I were not his sister. Can’t no other,
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

**Count.** Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
My fear hath catch’d your fondness. Now I see
The mystery of your loneliness, and find
Your salt tears’ head: Now to all sense ’tis gross
You love my son; invention is ashamed,
Against the proclamation of thy passion,
To say thou dost not; therefore tell me true;
But tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
Confess it, th’ one to th’ other; and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
That in their kind they speak it. Only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
If it be not, forswear ’t. Howe’er, I charge thee,
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
To tell me truly.

**Hel.** Good madam, pardon me!

**Count.** Do you love my son?

**Hel.** Your pardon, noble mistress!

**Count.** Love you my son?

**Hel.** Do not you love him, madam?

**Count.** Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond,
Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
The state of your affection; for your passions
Have to the full appeach’d.

**Hel.** Then, I confess,
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
That before you, and next unto high heaven,
I love your son.
My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love.
Be not offended; for it hurts not him
That he is loved of me. I follow him not
By any token of presumptuous suit;
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
Yet never know how that desert should be.
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
Religious in mine error, I adore
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
Let not your hate encounter with my love
For loving where you do; but if yourself,
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
Was both herself and love; O, then, give pity
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
That seeks not to find that her search implies,
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

**Count.** Had you not lately an intent—speak truly—
To go to Paris?

**Hel.** Madam, I had.

**Count.** Wherefore? tell true.

**Hel.** I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
You know my father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
And manifest experience had collected
For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me
In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
There is a remedy, approved, set down,
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
The King is render’d lost.

**Count.** For Paris, was it? speak.

**Hel.** My lord your son made me to think of this;
Else Paris and the medicine and the King
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then.

**Count.** But think you, Helen,
If you should tender your supposed aid,
He would receive it? he and his physicians
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
Embowell’d of their doctrine, have left off
The danger to itself?

**Hel.** There’s something in’t,
More than my father’s skill, which was the greatest
Of his profession, that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By the luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
But give me leave to try success, I’d venture
The well-lost life of mine on his Grace’s cure
By such a day and hour.

**Count.** Dost thou believe ’t?

**Hel.** Ay, madam, knowingly.

**Count.** Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
To those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home
And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt.
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.
*Exeunt.*

## ACT II

### Scene i. Paris: the King’s palace

*Flourish of cornets. Enter the King, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war, Bertram, and Parolles.*

**King.** Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
Do not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell!
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis received,
And is enough for both.

**1st Lord.** ’Tis our hope, sir,
After well enter’d soldiers, to return
And find your Grace in health.

**King.** No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
Will not confess he owes the malady
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
Whether I live or die, be you the sons
Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy—

Those bated that inherit but the fall
Of the last monarchy—see that you come
Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
That fame may cry you loud. I say, farewell.

2nd Lord. Health, at your bidding, serve your
majesty!

King. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them.
They say, our French lack language to deny,
If they demand. Beware of being captives,
Before you serve.

Both. Our hearts receive your warnings.

King. Farewell. Come hither to me.
[Exit, attended.]

1st Lord. O my sweet lord, that you will stay
behind us!

Par. ’Tis not his fault, the spark.

2nd Lord. O, ’tis brave wars!

Par. Most admirable. I have seen those wars!

Ber. I am commanded here, and kept a coil
with
“Too young” and “the next year” and “’tis too
early.”

Par. An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away
bravely.

Ber. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
But one to dance with! By heaven, I’ll steal
away.

1st Lord. There’s honour in the theft.

Par. Commit it, Count.

2nd Lord. I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

Ber. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

1st Lord. Farewell, captain.

2nd Lord. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

Par. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrenched it. Say to him, I live; and observe his reports for me.

1st Lord. We shall, noble captain.
[Exeunt lords.]

Par. Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

Ber. Stay. The King!
Re-enter King. Bertram and Parolles retire.

## ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL

### SCENE I

Par. [To Bertram.] Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and move under the influence of the most received star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.

Ber. And I will do so.

Par. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
[Exeunt Bertram and Parolles.]

Enter Lafeu.

Laf. [Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and
for my tidings.

King. I’ll fee thee to stand up.

Laf. Then here’s a man stands, that has brought
his pardon.
I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me
mercy,
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

King. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
And ask’d thee mercy for’t.

Laf. Good faith, across. But, my good lord, ’tis thus;
Will you be cured of your infirmity?

King. No.

Laf. O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
My royal fox could reach them. I have seen a
medicine
That’s able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With sprightly fire and motion; whose simple
touch
Is powerful to raise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemagne a pen in’s hand
And write to her a love-line.

King. What “her” is this?

Laf. Why, Doctor She. My lord, there’s one arrived,
If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom, and constancy, hath amazed me more
Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see
her,
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.

King. Now, good Lafeu,
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
By wondering how thou took’st it.

Laf. Nay, I’ll fit you.
And not be all day neither.
[Exit.]

King. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
Re-enter Lafeu, with Helena.

Laf. Nay, come your ways.

King. This haste hath wings indeed.

Laf. Nay, come your ways;
This is his majesty; say your mind to him.
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid’s uncle,
That dare leave two together; fare you well.
[Exit.]

King. Now, fair one, does your business follow
us?

Hel. Ay, my good lord.
Gerard de Narbon was my father;
In what he did profess, well found.

King. I knew him.

Hel. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death
Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
And of his old experience the only darling,
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
And, hearing your high Majesty is touch’d
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness.

King. We thank you, maiden;
But may not be so credulous of cure,
When our most learned doctors leave us and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her unaidable estate; I say we must not
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
To prostitute our past-cure malady
To empirics, or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit, to esteem
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

Hel. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
I will no more enforce mine office on you;
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one, to bear me back again.

King. I cannot give thee less, to be call’d
grateful.
Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I
give
As one near death to those that wish him live.
But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

Hel. What I can do can do no hurt to try,

## ACT II

Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister.
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown.
When judges have been babes; great floods have
flown
From simple sources, and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises, and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

King. I must not hear thee; fare thee well,
kind maid;
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid.
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

Hel. Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d.
It is not so with Him that all things knows,
As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim;
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure.

King. Art thou so confident? within what space
Hopest thou my cure?

Hel. The great’st grace lending grace,
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring.
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Moist Hesperus hath quench’d his sleepy lamp.
Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

King. Upon thy certainty and confidence
What darest thou venture?

Hel. Tax of impudence,
A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame
Traduced by odious ballads, my maiden’s name
Sear’d otherwise; nay, worse—if worse—extended
With vilest torture let my life be ended.

King. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth
speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak;
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense, sense saves another way.
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate.
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
That happiness and prime can happy call.
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
That ministers thine own death if I die.

Hel. If I break time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die.
And well deserved. Not helping, death’s my fee;
But, if I help, what do you promise me?

King. Make thy demand.

Hel. But will you make it even?

King. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of
heaven.

Hel. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly
hand
What husband in thy power I will command,
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

King. Here is my hand; the premises observed.
Thy will by my performance shall be served.
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
More should I question thee, and more I must,
Though more to know could not be more to
trust.
From whence thou camest, how tended on; but rest
Unquestion’d welcome and undoubted blest.
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.
[Flourish. Exeunt.]

### Scene II. Rousillon: The Count's Palace
Enter Countess and Clown.

Count. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to
the height of your breeding.

Clo. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.

Count. To the court! why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clo. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.

Count. Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.

Clo. It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.

Count. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clo. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

Count. Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?

Clo. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.

Count. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.

Clo. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.

Count. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clo. O Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.

Count. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clo. O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

Count. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clo. O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.

Count. You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clo. O Lord, sir! spare not me.

Count. Do you cry, “O Lord, sir!” at your whipping, and “spare not me”? Indeed your “O Lord, sir!” is very sequent to your whipping; you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.

Clo. I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my “O Lord, sir!” I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

Count. I play the noble housewife with the
time,
To entertain’t so merrily with a fool.

Clo. O Lord, sir! why, there serves well again.

Count. An end, sir; to your business. Give
Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back.
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son.
This is not much.

Clo. Not much commendation to them.

Count. Not much employment for you. You
understand me?

Clo. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.

Count. Haste you again.
[Exeunt severally.]

### Scene III. Paris: The King's Palace
Enter Bertram, Lafeu, and Parolles.

Laf. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.

Par. Why, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.

Ber. And so ’tis.

Laf. To be relinquished of the artists—

Par. So I say.

Laf. Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

Par. So I say.

Laf. Of all the learned and authentic fellows—

Par. Right; so I say.

Laf. That gave him out incurable—

Par. Why, there ’tis; so say I too.

Laf. Not to be helped—

Par. Right; as ’twere, a man assured of a—

Laf. Uncertain life, and sure death.

Par. Just, you say well; so would I have said.

Laf. I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

Par. It is, indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in—what do ye call there?

Laf. A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

Par. That’s it; I would have said the very same.

Laf. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. ’Fore me, I speak in respect—

Par. Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange, that is the brief and the tedious of it; and he’s of a most facinorous spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the—

Laf. Very hand of heaven.

Par. Ay, so I say.

Laf. In a most weak— [pausing] and debile minister, great power, great transcendence; which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the King, as to be— [pausing] generally thankful.

Par. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
Enter King, Helena, and Attendants. Lafeu and Parolles retire.

Laf. *Lustig*, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.

Par. *Mort du vinaigre!* is not this Helen?

Laf. ’Fore God, I think so.

King. Go, call before me all the lords in court.
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish’d
sense
Thou hast repeal’d, a second time receive
The confirmation of my promised gift,
Which but attends thy naming.
Enter three or four Lords.
Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful
parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s
voice
I have to use: thy frank election make;
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

Hel. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

Laf. I’d give bay Curtal and his furniture,
My mouth no more were broken than these boys’,
And writ as little beard.

King. Peruse them well.
Not one of those but had a noble father.

Hel. Gentlemen,
Heaven hath through me restored the King to
health.

All. We understand it, and thank heaven for
you.

Hel. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
That I protest I simply am a maid.
Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
‘We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
We’ll ne’er come there again.”

King. Make choice; and, see,
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

Hel. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

1st Lord. And grant it.

Hel. Thanks, sir; all the
rest is mute.

Laf. I had rather be in this choice than throw *ames-ace* for my life.

Hel. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair
eyes,
Before I speak, too threateningly replies.
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes and her humble love!

2nd Lord. No better, if you please.

Hel. My wish receive,
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

Laf. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine, I’d have them whipped; or I would send them to the Turk, to make eunuchs of.

Hel. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake.
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

Laf. These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.

Hel. You are too young, too happy, and too
good,
To make yourself a son out of my blood.

4th Lord. Fair one, I think not so.

Laf. There’s one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine. But if thou be’st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.

Hel. [To Bertram] I dare not say I take you;
but I give
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
Into your guiding power. This is the man.

King. Why, then, young Bertram, take her;
she’s thy wife.

Ber. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your
Highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.

King. Know’st thou not, Bertram,
What she has done for me?

Ber. Yes, my good lord;
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

King. Thou know’st she has raised me from my
sickly bed.

Ber. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Must answer for your raising? I know her well.
She had her breeding at my father’s charge.
A poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!

King. ’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the
which
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together,
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
A poor physician’s daughter, thou dislikest
Of virtue for the name. But do not so.
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
The place is dignified by the doer’s deed.
Where great additions swells, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Is good without a name. Vileness is so;
The property by what it is should go.
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she’s immediate heir,
And these breed honour. That is honour’s scorn,
Which challenges itself as honour’s born,
And is not like the sire. Honours thrive,
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our foregoers. The mere word’s a slave
Debosh’d on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb
Of honour’d bones indeed. What should be
said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
I can create the rest. Virtue and she
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

Ber. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do’t.

King. Thou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst
strive to choose.

Hel. That you are well restored, my lord, I’m
glad.
Let the rest go.

King. My honour’s at the stake; which to defeat,
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
We, poising us in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt.
Obey our will, which travails in thy good.
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and
hate
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

Ber. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
Is as ’twere born so.

King. Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.

Ber. I take her hand.

King. Good fortune and the favour of the King
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be perform’d to-night. The solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.
[Exeunt all but Lafeu and Parolles.]

Laf. [Advancing.] Do you hear, monsieur? a
word with you.

Par. Your pleasure, sir?

Laf. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.

Par. Recantation! My lord! my master!

Laf. Ay; is it not a language I speak?

Par. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!

Laf. Are you companion to the Count Roussillon?

Par. To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

Laf. To what is count’s man. Count’s master is of another style.

Par. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

Laf. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.

Par. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

Laf. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou’rt scarce worth.

Par. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—

Laf. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well. Thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.

Par. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

Laf. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

Par. I have not, my lord, deserved it.

Laf. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.

Par. Well, I shall be wiser.

Laf. Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ the contrary. If ever thou be’st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, “He is a man I know.”

Par. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

Laf. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.
[Exit.]

Par. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have of— I’ll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
Re-enter Lafeu.

Laf. Sirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you. You have a new mistress.

Par. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord. Whom I serve above is my master.

Laf. Who? God?

Par. Ay, sir.

Laf. The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? dost make hose of thy sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methinks, thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

Par. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

Laf. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and no true traveller; you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. I leave you.
[Exit.]

Par. Good, very good; it is so then. Good, very good; let it be concealed awhile.
Re-enter Bertram.

Ber. Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!

Par. What’s the matter, sweetheart?

Ber. Although before the solemn priest I have
sworn,
I will not bed her.

Par. What, what, sweetheart?

Ber. O my Parolles, they have married me!
I’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

Par. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
The tread of a man’s foot. To the wars!

Ber. There’s letters from my mother. What the
import is, I know not yet.

Par. Ay, that would be known. To the wars,
my boy, to the wars!
He wears his honour in a box unseen,
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,

Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
Therefore, to the war!

Ber. It shall be so. I'll send her to my house,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
That which I durst not speak: his present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.

Par. Will this *capriccio* hold in thee? Art sure?

Ber. Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

Par. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it.
'Tis hard!
A young man married is a man that's marr'd;
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.

[*Exeunt.*]

## Scene IV. Paris: the King's Palace

[*Enter Helena and Clown.*]

Hel. My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?

Clo. She is not well; but yet she has her health.
She's very merry; but yet she is not well; but
thanks be given, she's very well and wants noth-
ing i' the world; but yet she is not well.

Hel. If she be very well, what does she ail,
that she's not very well?

Clo. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two
things.

Hel. What two things?

Clo. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God
send her quickly! The other, that she's in earth,
from whence God send her quickly!

[*Enter Parolles.*]

Par. Bless you, my fortunate lady!

Hel. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have
mine own good fortunes.

Par. You had my prayers to lead them on; and
to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave,
how does my old lady?

Clo. So that you had her wrinkles and I her
money, I would she did as you say.

Par. Why, I say nothing.

Clo. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a
man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing.
To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing,
and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
title; which is within a very little of nothing.

Par. Away! Thou'rt a knave.

Clo. You should have said, sir, before a knave
thou'rt a knave; that's, before me thou'rt a
knave; this had been truth, sir.

Par. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found
thee.

Clo. Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were
you taught to find me? The search, sir, was
profitable; and much fool may you find in you,
even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
laughter.

Par. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which, as your due, time claims, he does ac-
knowledge;
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with
sweets,
Which they distil now in the curbed time,
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim.

Hel. What's his will else?

Par. That you take your instant leave o' the
King,
And make this haste as your own good proceed-
ing,
Strengthen'd with what apology you think
May make it probable need.

Hel. What more commands he?

Par. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.

Hel. In everything I wait upon his will.

Par. I shall report it so.

Hel. I pray you. [*Exit Parolles.*]
Come, sirrah. [*Exeunt.*]

## Scene V. Paris: the King's Palace

[*Enter Lafeu and Bertram.*]

Laf. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a
soldier.

Ber. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

Laf. You have it from his own deliverance.

Ber. And by other warranted testimony.

Laf. Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark
for a bunting.

Ber. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great
in knowledge and accordingly valiant.

Laf. I have then sinned against his experience
and transgressed against his valour; and my state
that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in
my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you,
make us friends; I will pursue the amity.

[*Enter Parolles.*]

Par. [*To Bertram*] These things shall be done,
sir.

Laf. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

Par. Sir?

Laf. O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
workman, a very good tailor.

Ber. [*Aside to Parolles*] Is she gone to the
King?

Par. She is.

Ber. Will she away to-night?

Par. As you'll have her.

Ber. I have writ my letters, casketed my treas-
ure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.

Laf. A good traveller is something at the latter
end of a dinner; but one that lies three-thirds
and uses a known truth to pass a thousand noth-
ings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
God save you, captain.

Ber. Is there any unkindness between my lord
and you, monsieur?

Par. I know not how I have deserved to run into
my lord's displeasure.

Laf. You have made shift to run into 't, boots
and spurs and all, like him that leaped into the
custard; and out of it you'll run again, rather
than suffer question for your residence.

Ber. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

Laf. And shall do so ever, though I took him
at 's prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and be-
lieve this of me, there can be no kernel in this
light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust
him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have
kept of them tame, and know their natures. Fare-
well, monsieur. I have spoken better of you than
you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
must do good against evil. [*Exit.*]

Par. An idle lord, I swear.

Ber. I think so.

Par. Why, do you not know him?

Ber. Yes, I do know him well, and common
speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

[*Enter Helena.*]

Hel. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the King and have procured his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.

Ber. I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepared I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
That presently you take your way for home;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not. This to my mother:

[*Giving a letter.*]

'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
I leave you to your wisdom.

Hel. Sir, I can nothing say,
But that I am your most obedient servant.

Ber. Come, come, no more of that.

Hel. And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
To equal my great fortune.

Ber. Let that go.
My hate is very great. Farewell; hie home.

Hel. Pray, sir, your pardon.

Ber. Well, what would you say?

Hel. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own.

Ber. What would you have?

Hel. Something; and scarce so much; nothing,
indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
Faith, yes;
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

Ber. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

Hel. I shall not break your bidding, good my
lord.

Ber. Where are my other men, monsieur? Fare-
well. [*Exit Helena.*]
Go thou toward home; where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.

Par. Bravely, *coragio*!

[*Exeunt.*]

## ACT III

### Scene I. Florence: the Duke's Palace

[*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, attended;
the two French Lords, with a troop of soldiers.*]

Duke. So that from point to point now have you
heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let
forth
And more thirsts after.

1st Lord. Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.

Duke. Therefore we marvel much our cousin
France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

2nd Lord. Good my lord,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
But like a common and an outward man,
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess'd.

Duke. Be it his pleasure.

1st Lord. But I am sure the younger of our na-
ture,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.

Duke. Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell.
To-morrow to the field. [*Flourish. Exeunt.*]

### Scene II. Rousillon: the Count's Palace

[*Enter Countess and Clown.*]

Count. It hath happened all as I would have had
it, save that he comes not along with her.

Clo. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a
very melancholy man.

Count. By what observance, I pray you?

Clo. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing;
mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing;
pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had
this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for
a song.

Count. Let me see what he writes, and when he
means to come. [*Opening a letter.*]

Clo. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court.
Our old ling and our Isbels o' the country are
nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' the
court. The brains of my Cupid's knocked out,
and I begin to love, as an old man loves money,
with no stomach.

Count. What have we here?

Clo. E'en that you have there. [*Exit.*]

Count. [*Reads*]
> "I have sent you a daughter-in-
> law. She hath recovered the King, and undone
> me. I have wedded her, not bedded her; and
> sworn to make the 'not' eternal. You shall hear
> I am run away. Know it before the report come.
> If there be breadth enough in the world, I will
> hold a long distance. My duty to you.
> Your unfortunate son,
> Bertram."

This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
To fly the favours of so good a King;
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.

[*Re-enter Clown.*]

Clo. O madam, yonder is heavy news within
between two soldiers and my young lady!

Count. What is the matter?

Clo. Nay, there is some comfort in the news,
some comfort; your son will not be killed so soon
as I thought he would.

Count. Why should he be killed?

Clo. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear
he does. The danger is in standing to't; that's the
loss of men, though it be the getting of children.
Here they come will tell you more; for my part,
I only hear your son was run away. [*Exit.*]

[*Enter Helena and two French Lords.*]

1st Lord. Save you, good madam.

Hel. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

2nd Lord. Do not say so.

Count. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentle-
men,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto't. Where is my son, I pray
you?

2nd Lord. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke
of Florence.
We met him thitherward; for thence we
came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Thither we bend again.

Hel. Look on his letter, madam; here's my
passport.

[*Reads*]
> "When thou canst get the ring upon my
> finger which never shall come off, and show me
> a child begotten of thy body that I am father to,
> then call me husband; but in such a 'then' I write
> a 'never.'"

This is a dreadful sentence.

Count. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

1st Lord. Ay, madam;
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our
pains.

Count. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is
he?

2nd Lord. Ay, madam.

Count. And to be a soldier?

2nd Lord. Such is his noble purpose; and, be-
lieve 't,
The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.

Count. Return you thither?

1st Lord. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of
speed.

Hel. [*Reads*]
> "Till I have no wife, I have noth-
> ing in France."

'Tis bitter.

Count. Find you that there?

Hel. Ay, madam.

1st Lord. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand, hap-
ly, which his heart was not consenting to.

Count. Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with
him?

1st Lord. A servant only, and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known.

Count. Parolles, was it not?

1st Lord. Ay, my good lady, he.

Count. A very tainted fellow, and full of wick-
edness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.

1st Lord. Indeed, good lady,
The fellow has a deal of that too much,
Which holds him much to have.

Count. You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.

2nd Lord. We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.

Count. Not so, but as we change our cour-
tesies.
Will you draw near?

[*Exeunt Countess and the two Lords.*]

Hel. "Till I have no wife, I have nothing in
France."
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! Is't I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where
thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't;
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected. Better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rou-
sillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all. I will be gone;
My being here it is that holds thee hence.
Shall I stay here to do't? No, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all. I will be gone,
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

[*Exit.*]

### Scene III. Florence: before the Duke's Palace

[*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram,
Parolles, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets.*]

Duke. The general of our horse thou art; and
we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.

Ber. Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To the extreme edge of hazard.

Duke. Then go thou forth;
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!

Ber. This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum, hater of love. [*Exeunt.*]

### Scene IV. Rousillon: the Count's Palace

[*Enter Countess and Steward.*]

Count. Alas! and would you take the letter of
her?
Might you not know she would do as she has
done,
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

Stew. [*Reads*]
> "I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
> Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
> That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
> With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
> Write, write, that from the bloody course of
> war
> My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
> Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
> His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
> His taken labours bid him me forgive;
> I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
> From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
> Where death and danger dogs the heels of
> worth.
> He is too good and fair for Death and me,
> Whom I myself embrace, to set him free."

Count. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest
words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented.

Stew. Pardon me, madam.
If I had given you this at over-night,
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she
writes,
Pursuit would be but vain.

Count. What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to
hear
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife;
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense
To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me
speak. [*Exeunt.*]

### Scene V. Florence: without the Walls. A Tucket afar off.

[*Enter an old Widow of Florence, Diana, Violenta,
and Mariana, with other Citizens.*]

Wid. Nay, come; for if they do approach the
city, we shall lose all the sight.

Dia. They say the French Count has done most
honourable service.

Wid. It is reported that he has taken their great-
est commander; and that with his own hand he
slew the Duke's brother. [*Tucket.*] We have lost
our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark!
you may know by their trumpets.

Mar. Come, let's return again, and suffice our-
selves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take
heed of this French Earl. The honour of a maid is
her name; and no legacy is so rich as honesty.

Wid. I have told my neighbour how you have
been solicited by a gentleman his companion.

Mar. I know that knave; hang him! One Parol-
les; a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for
the young Earl. Beware of them, Diana; their
promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
these engines of lust, are not the things they go
under. Many a maid hath been seduced by them;
and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows
in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
dissuade succession, but that they are limed with
the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not
to advise you further; but I hope your own grace
will keep you where you are, though there were
no further danger known but the modesty which
is so lost.

Dia. You shall not need to fear me.

Wid. I hope so.

[*Enter Helena, disguised like a Pilgrim.*]

Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
at my house; thither they send one another. I'll
question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are
you bound?

Hel. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

Wid. At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

Hel. Is this the way?

Wid. Ay, marry, is't.

[*A march afar.*]

Hark you! they come this way.
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
But till the troops come by,
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
The rather, for I think I know your hostess
As ample as myself.

Hel. Is it yourself?

Wid. If you shall please so, pilgrim.

Hel. I thank you, and will stay upon your lei-
sure.

Wid. You came, I think, from France?

Hel. I did so.

Wid. Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service.

Hel. His name, I pray you.

Dia. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a
one?

Hel. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of
him.
His face I know not.

Dia. Whatsome'er he is,
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
As 'tis reported, for the King had married him
Against his liking. Think you it is so?

Hel. Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his
lady.

Dia. There is a gentleman that serves the Count
Reports but coarsely of her.

Hel. What's his name?

Dia. Monsieur Parolles.

Hel. O, I believe with him,
In argument of praise, or to the worth
Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
To have her name repeated. All her deserving
Is a reserved honesty, and that
I have not heard examined.

Dia. Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord.

Wid. I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she
is,
Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might
do her
A shrewd turn, if she pleased.

Hel. How do you mean?
May be the amorous Count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose.

Wid. He does indeed;
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid.
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
In honestest defence.

Mar. The gods forbid else!

Wid. So, now they come.

[*Drum and Colours.*]

[*Enter Bertram, Parolles, and the whole army.*]

That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
That, Escalus.

Hel. Which is the Frenchman?

Dia. He;
That with the plume. 'Tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he loved his wife. If he were honester
He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome
gentleman?

Hel. I like him well.

Dia. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same
knave
That leads him to these places. Were I his lady,
I would poison that vile rascal.

Hel. Which is he?

Dia. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he
melancholy?

Hel. Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

Par. Lose our drum! well.

Mar. He's shrewdly vexed at something. Look,
he has spied us.

Wid. Marry, hang you!

Mar. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

[*Exeunt Bertram, Parolles, and army.*]

Wid. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will
bring you
Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
Already at my house.

Hel. I humbly thank you.
Please it this matron and this gentle maid
To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
Worthy the note.

Both. We'll take your offer kindly.

[*Exeunt.*]

### Scene VI. Camp before Florence

[*Enter Bertram and the two French Lords.*]

2nd Lord. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let
him have his way.

1st Lord. If your lordship find him not a hilding,
hold me no more in your respect.

2nd Lord. On my life, my lord, a bubble.

Ber. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

2nd Lord. Believe it, my lord, in mine own di-
rect knowledge, without any malice, but to speak
of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable cow-
ard, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly prom-
ise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality
worthy your lordship's entertainment.

1st Lord. It were fit you knew him; lest, repos-
ing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he
might at some great and trusty business in a main
danger fail you.

Ber. I would I knew in what particular action to
try him.

1st Lord. None better than to let him fetch off
his drum, which you hear him so confidently
undertake to do.

2nd Lord. I, with a troop of Florentines, will
suddenly surprise him; such I will have, whom I
am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will
bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose
no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of
the adversaries, when we bring him to our own
tents. Be but your lordship present at his exami-
nation. If he do not, for the promise of his life
and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer
to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in
his power against you, and that with the divine
forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
judgement in anything.

1st Lord. O, for the love of laughter, let him
fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't.
When your lordship sees the bottom of his suc-
cess in 't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump
of ore will be melted, if you give him not John
Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be
removed. Here he comes.

[*Enter Parolles.*]

2nd Lord. [*Aside to Bertram*] O, for the love of
laughter, hinder not the honour of his design. Let
him fetch off his drum in any hand.

Ber. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sore-
ly in your disposition.

1st Lord. A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

Par. "But a drum!" Is't "but a drum?" A drum
so lost! There was excellent command—to
charge in with our horse upon our own wings,
and to rend our own soldiers!

1st Lord. That was not to be blamed in the com-
mand of the service. It was a disaster of war that
*Caesar* himself could not have prevented, if he
had been there to command.

Ber. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our suc-
cess. Some dishonour we had in the loss of that
drum; but it is not to be recovered.

Par. It might have been recovered.

Ber. It might; but it is not now.

Par. It is to be recovered; but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
performer, I would have that drum or another,
or *hic jacet*.

Ber. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, mon-
sieur; if you think your mystery in stratagem
can bring this instrument of honour again into
his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enter-
prise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a
worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the Duke
shall both speak of it, and extend to you what
further becomes his greatness, even to the ut-
most syllable of your worthiness.

Par. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

Ber. But you must not now slumber in it.

Par. I'll about it this evening; and I will present-
ly pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in
my certainty, put myself into my mortal prepara-
tion; and by midnight look to hear further from
me.

Ber. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you
are gone about it?

Par. I know not what the success will be, my
lord; but the attempt I vow.

Ber. I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possi-
bility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee.
Farewell.

Par. I love not many words. [*Exit.*]

2nd Lord. No more than a fish loves water. Is
not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confi-
dently seems to undertake this business, which
he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do
and dares better be damned than to do 't?

1st Lord. You do not know him, my lord, as we
do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a
man's favour and for a week escape a great deal
of discoveries; but when you find him out, you
have him ever after.

Ber. Why, do you think he will make no deed
at all of this that so seriously he does address
himself unto?

2nd Lord. None in the world; but return with

an invention and clap upon you two or three
probable lies. But we have almost embossed
him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he
is not for your lordship's respect.

**First Lord.** We'll make you some sport with the
fox ere we case him. He was first smoked by the
old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and he is part¬
ed, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which
you shall see this very night.

**Second Lord.** I must go look my twigs. He shall be
caught.

**Bertram.** Your brother he shall go along with me.

**Second Lord.** As't please your lordship. I'll leave
you. *[Exit.]*

**Bertram.** Now will I lead you to the house, and show
you
The lass I spoke of.

**First Lord.** But you say she's honest.

**Bertram.** That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to
her,
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature.
Will you go see her?

**First Lord.** With all my heart, my lord.
*[Exeunt.]*

### Scene VII. Florence: The Widow's House
*Enter Helena and Widow.*

**Helena.** If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
I know not how I shall assure you further,
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

**Widow.** Though my estate be fallen, I was well
born,
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act.

**Helena.** Nor would I wish you.
First, give me trust, the Count he is my hus¬
band,
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
Err in bestowing it.

**Widow.** I should believe you;
For you have show'd me that which well ap¬
proves
You're great in fortune.

**Helena.** Take this purse of gold,
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
Which I will over-pay and pay again
When I have found it. The Count he wooes your
daughter,
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
Resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
Now his important blood will nought deny
That she'll demand. A ring the Count wears,
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son, some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
Howe'er repented after.

**Widow.** Now I see
The bottom of your purpose.

**Helena.** You see it lawful, then. It is no more,
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
Herself most chastely absent. After this,
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
To what is past already.

**Widow.** I have yielded.
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
As if his life lay on't.

**Helena.** Why then to-night
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
But let's about it. *[Exeunt.]*

## ACT IV

### Scene I. Without the Florentine Camp
*Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush.*

**Second Lord.** He can come no other way but by
this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him,
speak what terrible language you will. Though
you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for
we must not seem to understand him, unless some
one among us whom we must produce for an in¬
terpreter.

**First Soldier.** Good captain, let me be the inter¬
preter.

**Second Lord.** Art not acquainted with him? Knows
he not thy voice?

**First Soldier.** No, sir, I warrant you.

**Second Lord.** But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to
speak to us again?

**First Soldier.** E'en such as you speak to me.

**Second Lord.** He must think us some band of
strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. Now
he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages;
therefore we must every one be a man of his own
fancy, not to know what we speak one to another;
so we seem to know, is to know straight our pur¬
pose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good
enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem
very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to
beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return
and swear the lies he forges.

*Enter Parolles.*

**Parolles.** Ten o'clock; within these three hours
'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I
say I have done? It must be a very plausive in¬
vention that carries it. They begin to smoke
me; and disgraces have of late knocked too often
at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy;
but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it
and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
tongue.

**Second Lord.** *[Aside, in ambush.]* This is the first
truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.

**Parolles.** What the devil should move me to under¬
take the recovery of this drum, being not igno¬
rant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no
such purpose? I must give myself some hurts,
and say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will
not carry it; they will say, "Came you off with
so little?" and great ones I dare not give. Where¬
fore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put
you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy my¬
self another of Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me
into these perils.

**Second Lord.** Is it possible he should know what
he is, and be that he is?

**Parolles.** I would the cutting of my garments would
serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish
sword.

**Second Lord.** We cannot afford you so.

**Parolles.** Or the baring of my beard; and to say it
was in stratagem.

**Second Lord.** 'Twould not do.

**Parolles.** Or to drown my clothes, and say I was
stripped.

**Second Lord.** Hardly serve.

**Parolles.** Though I swore I leaped from the window
of the citadel—

**Second Lord.** How deep?

**Parolles.** Thirty fathom.

**Second Lord.** Three great oaths would scarce make
that be believed.

**Parolles.** I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I
would swear I recovered it.

**Second Lord.** You shall hear one anon.

**Parolles.** A drum now of the enemy's—
*[Alarum within.]*

**Second Lord.** *Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.*
**All.** *Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo,
cargo.*

**Parolles.** O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.

*They seize and blindfold him.*

**First Soldier.** *Boskos thromuldo boskos.*

**Parolles.** I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
And I shall lose my life for want of language.
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

**First Soldier.** *Boskos vauvado*: I understand thee, and
can speak thy tongue. *Kerelybonto*, sir, betake
thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at
thy bosom.

**Parolles.** O!

**First Soldier.** O, pray, pray, pray! *Manka revania
dulche.*

**Second Lord.** *Oscorbidulchos volivorco.*

**First Soldier.** The general is content to spare thee
yet;
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life.

**Parolles.** O, let me live!
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
Which you will wonder at.

**First Soldier.** But wilt thou faithfully?

**Parolles.** If I do not, damn me.

**First Soldier.** *Acordo linta.*
Come on; thou art granted space.
*[Exit, with Parolles guarded. A short
alarum within.]*

**Second Lord.** Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and
my brother,
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep
him muffled
Till we do hear from them.

**Second Soldier.** Captain, I will.

**Second Lord.** A' will betray us all unto ourselves;
Inform on that.

**Second Soldier.** So I will, sir.

**Second Lord.** Till then I'll keep him dark and
safely lock'd. *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene II. Florence: The Widow's House
*Enter Bertram and Diana.*

**Bertram.** They told me that your name was Fontibell.

**Diana.** No, my good lord, Diana.

**Bertram.** Titled goddess;
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
You are no maiden, but a monument.
When you are dead, you should be such a one
As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.

**Diana.** She then was honest.

**Bertram.** So should you be.

**Diana.** No.
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
As you owe to your wife.

**Bertram.** No more o' that;
I prithee, do not strive against my vows.
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service.

**Diana.** Ay, so you serve us
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
And mock us with our bareness.

**Bertram.** How have I sworn!

**Diana.** 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the
truth,
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
But take the Highest to witness. Then, pray you,
tell me,
If I should swear by God's great attributes,
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
To swear by Him whom I protest to love,
That I will work against Him; therefore your
oaths
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
At least in my opinion.

**Bertram.** Change it, change it;
Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Who then recover. Say thou art mine, and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever.

**Diana.** I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

**Bertram.** I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no
power
To give it from me.

**Diana.** Will you not, my lord?

**Bertram.** It is an honour 'longing to our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose.

**Diana.** Mine honour's such a ring,
My chastity's the jewel of our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
Against your vain assault.

**Bertram.** Here, take my ring.
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
And I'll be bid by thee.

**Diana.** When midnight comes, knock at my
chamber-window.
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.
My reasons are most strong; and you shall
know them
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd;
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

**Bertram.** A heaven on earth I have won by wooing
thee. *[Exit.]*

**Diana.** For which live long to thank both heaven
and me!
You may so in the end.
My mother told me just how he would woo,
As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win. *[Exit.]*

### Scene III. The Florentine Camp.
*Enter the Two French Lords and some two or three
Soldiers.*

**First Lord.** You have not given him his mother's
letter?

**Second Lord.** I have delivered it an hour since.
There is something in't that stings his nature; for
on the reading it he changed almost into another
man.

**First Lord.** He has much worthy blame laid upon
him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet
a lady.

**Second Lord.** Especially he hath incurred the ever¬
lasting displeasure of the King, who had even
tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will
tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
with you.

**First Lord.** When you have spoken, 'tis dead,
and I am the grave of it.

**Second Lord.** He hath perverted a young gentle¬
woman here in Florence, of a most chaste re¬
nown, and this night he fleshes his will in the
spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monu¬
mental ring, and thinks himself made in the
unchaste composition.

**First Lord.** Now, God delay our rebellion! As we
are ourselves, what things are we!

**Second Lord.** Merely our own traitors. And as in
the common course of all treasons, we still see
them reveal themselves, till they attain to their
abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives
against his own nobility, in his proper stream
o'erflows himself.

**First Lord.** Is it not meant damnable in us to be
trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall
not then have his company to-night?

**Second Lord.** Not till after midnight; for he is
dieted to his hour.

**First Lord.** That approaches apace; I would
gladly have him see his company anatomized,
that he might take a measure of his own judge¬
ments, wherein so curiously he had set this coun¬
terfeit.

**Second Lord.** We will not meddle with him till he
come; for his presence must be the whip of the
other.

**First Lord.** In the mean time, what hear you of
these wars?

**Second Lord.** I hear there is an overture of peace.

**First Lord.** Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

**Second Lord.** What will Count Rousillon do then?
Will he travel higher, or return again into
France?

**First Lord.** I perceive, by this demand, you are
not altogether of his council.

**Second Lord.** Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a
great deal of his act.

**First Lord.** Sir, his wife some two months since
fled from his house. Her pretence is a pilgri¬
mage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy
undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
accomplished; and, there residing, the tenderness
of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in
fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she
sings in heaven.

**Second Lord.** How is this justified?

**First Lord.** The stronger part of it by her own
letters, which makes her story true, even to the
point of her death. Her death itself, which could
not be her office to say is come, was faithfully
confirmed by the rector of the place.

**Second Lord.** Hath the Count all this intelligence?

**First Lord.** Ay, and the particular confirmations,
point from point, to the full arming of the verity.

**Second Lord.** I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad
of this.

**First Lord.** How mightily sometimes we make
us comforts of our losses!

**Second Lord.** And how mightily some other times
we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity
that his valour hath here acquired for him shall
at home be encountered with a shame as ample.

**First Lord.** The web of our life is of a mingled
yarn, good and ill together. Our virtues would be
proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our
crimes would despair, if they were not cherished
by our virtues.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**First Lord.** How now! Where's your master?

**Messenger.** He met the Duke in the street, sir, of
whom he hath taken a solemn leave. His lord¬
ship will next morning for France. The Duke
hath offered him letters of commendations to the
King.

**Second Lord.** They shall be no more than needful
there, if they were more than they can commend.

**First Lord.** They cannot be too sweet for the
King's tartness. Here's his lordship now.

*Enter Bertram.*

**First Lord.** How now, my lord! Is 't not after midnight?

**Bertram.** I have to-night dispatched sixteen busi¬
nesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract
of success. I have congied with the Duke, done
my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife,
mourned for her; writ to my lady mother I am
returning; entertained my convoy; and between
these main parcels of dispatch effected many
nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I
have not ended yet.

**Second Lord.** If the business be of any difficulty,
and this morning your departure hence, it re¬
quires haste of your lordship.

**Bertram.** I mean, the business is not ended, as fear¬
ing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, has de¬
ceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

**Second Lord.** Bring him forth. Has sat i' the stocks
all night, poor gallant knave.

**Bertram.** No matter; his heels have deserved it, in
usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry
himself?

**Second Lord.** I have told your lordship already, the
stocks carry him. But to answer you as you
would be understood; he weeps like a wench
that had shed her milk. He hath confessed him¬
self to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar,
from the time of his remembrance to this very
instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks; and
what think you he hath confessed?

**Bertram.** Nothing of me, has he?

**Second Lord.** His confession is taken, and it shall
be read to his face. If your lordship be in't,
as I believe you are, you must have the patience
to hear it.

*Enter Parolles guarded, and First Soldier.*

**Bertram.** A plague upon him! Muffled! He can say
nothing of me. Hush, hush!

**First Lord.** Hoodman comes! *Portotartarosa.*

**First Soldier.** He calls for the tortures. What will
you say without 'em?

**Parolles.** I will confess what I know without con¬
straint. If ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say
no more.

**First Soldier.** *Bosko chimurcho.*

**First Lord.** *Boblibindo chicurmurco.*

**First Soldier.** You are a merciful general. Our
general bids you answer to what I shall ask you
out of a note.

**Parolles.** And truly, as I hope to live.

**First Soldier.** *[Reads]* "First demand of him how
many horse the Duke is strong." What say you
to that?

**Parolles.** Five or six thousand; but very weak and
unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my
reputation and credit and as I hope to live.

**First Soldier.** Shall I set down your answer so?

**Parolles.** Do. I'll take the sacrament on't, how and
which way you will.

**Bertram.** All's one to him. What a past-saving slave
is this!

**First Lord.** You're deceived, my lord; this is
Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist—that
was his own phrase—that had the whole theoric
of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice
in the chape of his dagger.

**Second Lord.** I will never trust a man again for
keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have
everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.

**First Soldier.** Well, that's set down.

**Parolles.** Five or six thousand horse, I said—I will
say true—or thereabouts, set down, for I'll
speak truth.

**First Lord.** He's very near the truth in this.

**Bertram.** But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature
he delivers it.

**Parolles.** Poor rogues, I pray you, say.

**First Soldier.** Well, that's set down.

**Parolles.** I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth,
the rogues are marvellous poor.

**First Soldier.** *[Reads]* "Demand of him, of what
strength they are a-foot." What say you to that?

**Parolles.** By my troth, sir, if I were to live this
present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio,
a hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Coram¬
bus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo,
Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred and fifty
each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond,
Bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the
muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life,
amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the
which dare not shake the snow from off their
cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

**Bertram.** What shall be done to him?

**First Lord.** Nothing, but let him have thanks.
Demand of him my condition, and what credit I
have with the Duke.

**First Soldier.** Well, that's set down. *[Reads]* "You
shall demand of him, whether one Captain
Dumain be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his
reputation is with the Duke; what his valour,
honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he
thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing
sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt."
What say you to this? What do you know of it?

**Parolles.** I beseech you, let me answer to the par¬
ticular of the interrogatories. Demand them singly.

**First Soldier.** Do you know this Captain Dumain?

**Parolles.** I know him. A' was a botcher's 'prentice
in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting
the shrieve's fool with child—a dumb innocent,
that could not say him nay.

*First Lord raises his hand as if to strike him.*

**Bertram.** Nay, by your leave, hold your hands;
though I know his brains are forfeit to the next
tile that falls.

**First Soldier.** Well, is this captain in the Duke of
Florence's camp?

**Parolles.** Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

**First Lord.** Nay, look not so upon me; we shall
hear of your lordship anon.

**First Soldier.** What is his reputation with the Duke?

**Parolles.** The Duke knows him for no other but a
poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other
day to turn him out o' the band. I think I have
his letter in my pocket.

**First Soldier.** Marry, we'll search.

**Parolles.** In good sadness, I do not know; either it is
there, or it is upon a file with the Duke's other
letters in my tent.

**First Soldier.** Here 'tis; here's a paper; shall I read
it to you?

**Parolles.** I do not know if it be it or no.

**Bertram.** Our interpreter does it well.

**First Lord.** Excellently.

**First Soldier.** *[Reads]* "Dian, the Count's a fool, and
full of gold"—

**Parolles.** That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is
an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence,
one Diana to take heed of the allurement of one
Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all
that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.

**First Soldier.** Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

**Parolles.** My meaning in't, I protest, was very
honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the
young Count to be a dangerous and lascivious
boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up
all the fry it finds.

**Bertram.** Damnable both-sides rogue!

**First Soldier.** *[Reads]*
> "When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
> After he scores, he never pays the score.
> Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
> He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
> And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
> Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss.
> For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
> Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
> Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
> Parolles"

**Bertram.** He shall be whipped through the army
with this rhyme in his forehead.

**Second Lord.** This is your devoted friend, sir, the
manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.

**Bertram.** I could endure anything before but a cat,
and now he's a cat to me.

**First Soldier.** I perceive, sir, by the general's looks,
we shall be fain to hang you.

**Parolles.** My life, sir, in any case. Not that I am
afraid to die; but that, my offences being many,
I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let
me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any
where, so I may live.

**First Soldier.** We'll see what may be done, so you
confess freely; therefore, once more to this Cap¬
tain Dumain. You have answered to his reputa¬
tion with the Duke and to his valour. What is
his honesty?

**Parolles.** He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister;
for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus;
he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking
'em he is stronger than Hercules; he will lie, sir,
with such volubility, that you would think truth
were a fool; drunkenness is his best virtue, for he
will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does
little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him;
but they know his conditions and lay him in
straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his
honesty. He has everything that an honest man
should not have; what an honest man should have,
he has nothing.

**First Lord.** I begin to love him for this.

**Bertram.** For this description of thine honesty?
A pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat.

**First Soldier.** What say you to his expertness in
war?

**Parolles.** Faith, sir, has led the drum before the
English tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and
more of his soldiership I know not; except, in
that country he had the honour to be the officer
at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for
the doubling of files. I would do the man what
honour I can, but of this I am not certain.

**First Lord.** He hath out-villained villainy so far
that the rarity redeems him.

**Bertram.** A pox on him, he's a cat still.

**First Soldier.** His qualities being at this poor price,
I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to
revolt.

**Parolles.** Sir, for a *quart d'écu* he will sell the fee-
simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and
cut the entail from all remainders, and a per¬
petual succession for it perpetually.

**First Soldier.** What's his brother, the other Captain
Dumain?

**Second Lord.** Why does he ask him of me?

**First Soldier.** What's he?

**Parolles.** E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether
so great as the first in goodness, but greater a
great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a
coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the
best that is; in a retreat he outruns any lackey;
marry, in coming on he has the cramp.

**First Soldier.** If your life be saved, will you under¬
take to betray the Florentine?

**Parolles.** Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count
Rousillon.

**First Soldier.** I'll whisper with the general, and know
his pleasure.

**Parolles.** *[Aside]* I'll no more drumming; a plague
of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and
to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young
boy the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet
who would have suspected an ambush where I
was taken?

**First Soldier.** There is no remedy, sir, but you must
die. The general says, you that have so traitor¬
ously discovered the secrets of your army and
made such pestiferous reports of men very
nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use;
therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off
with his head.

**Parolles.** O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my
death!

**First Soldier.** That shall you, and take your leave
of all your friends. *[Unblinding him.]*
So, look about you. Know you any here?

**Bertram.** Good morrow, noble captain.

**Second Lord.** God bless you, Captain Parolles.

**First Lord.** God save you, noble captain.

**Second Lord.** Captain, what greeting will you to
my Lord Lafeu? I am for France.

**First Lord.** Good captain, will you give me a
copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf
of the Count Rousillon? An I were not a very
coward, I'd compel it of you: but fare you
well.
*[Exeunt Bertram and Lords.]*

**First Soldier.** You are undone, captain, all but your
scarf; that has a knot on't yet.

**Parolles.** Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

**First Soldier.** If you could find out a country where

but women were that had received so much
shame, you might begin an impudent nation.
Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too. We shall
speak of you there.

*Exit with SOLDIERS.*

Par. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more;
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
That every braggart shall be found an ass.
Rust, sword! cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
Safest in shame! being fool’d, by foolery thrive!
There’s place and means for every man alive.
I’ll after them. *Exit.*

### Scene iv. Florence: the Widow's house
*Enter Helena, Widow, and Diana.*

Hel. That you may well perceive I have not
wrong’d you,
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my surety; ’fore whose throne ’tis needful
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
Time was, I did him a desired office,
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth,
And answer, thanks. I duly am inform’d
His Grace is at Marseilles; to which place
We have convenient convoy. You must know
I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
And by the leave of my good lord the King,
We’ll be before our welcome.

Wid. Gentle madam,
You never had a servant to whose trust
Your business was more welcome.

Hel. Nor you, mistress,
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
When saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts
Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
With what it loathes for that which is away.
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf.

Dia. Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

Hel. Yet, I pray you.
But with the word the time will bring on summer.
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
Our waggon is prepared, and time revives us.
All’s well that ends well. Still the fine’s the
crown;
Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.

*Exeunt.*

### Scene v. Rousillon: the Count's palace
*Enter Countess, Lafeu, and Clown.*

Laf. No, no, no, your son was misled with a
snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron
would have made all the unbaked and doughy
youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-
in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son
here at home, more advanced by the King than
by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

Count. I would I had not known him; it was the
death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that
ever nature had praise for creating. If she had
partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest
groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a
more rooted love.

Laf. ’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady;
we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on
such another herb.

Clo. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram
of the salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

Laf. They are not herbs, you knave; they are
nose-herbs.

Clo. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have
not much skill in grass.

Laf. Whither dost thou profess thyself, a
knave or a fool?

Clo. A fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a
knave at a man’s.

Laf. Your distinction?

Clo. I would cozen the man of his wife and do
his service.

Laf. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

Clo. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir,
to do her service.

Laf. I will subscribe for thee, thou art both
knave and fool.

Clo. At your service.

Laf. No, no, no.

Clo. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can
serve as great a prince as you are.

Laf. Who’s that? a Frenchman?

Clo. Faith, sir, a’ has an English name; but his
fisnomy is more hotter in France than there.

Laf. What prince is that?

Clo. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of
Darkness; alias, the devil.

Laf. Hold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee
not this to suggest thee from thy master thou
talkest of; serve him still.

Clo. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always
loved a great fire; and the master I speak of ever
keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of
the world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I
am for the house with the narrow gate, which I
take to be too little for pomp to enter. Some that
humble themselves may; but the many will be
too chill and tender, and they’ll be for the flowery
way that leads to the broad gate and the great
fire.

Laf. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee;
and I tell thee so before, because I would not
fall out with thee. Go thy ways. Let my horses
be well looked to, without any tricks.

Clo. If I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall
be jades’ tricks; which are their own right by
the law of nature. *Exit.*

Laf. A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

Count. So he is. My lord that’s gone made
himself much sport out of him. By his authority
he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for
his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace, but
runs where he will.

Laf. I like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I
was about to tell you, since I heard of the good
lady’s death and that my lord your son was upon
his return home, I moved the King my master to
speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in
the minority of them both, his Majesty, out of a
self-gracious remembrance, did first propose. His
Highness hath promised me to do it; and, to stop
up the displeasure he hath conceived against your
son, there is no fitter matter. How does your
ladyship like it?

Count. With very much content, my lord;
and I wish it happily effected.

Laf. His Highness comes post from Marseilles,
of as able body as when he numbered thirty. He
will be here to-morrow, or I am deceived by him
that in such intelligence hath seldom failed.

Count. It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see
him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be
here to-night. I shall beseech your lordship to remain
with me till they meet together.

Laf. Madam, I was thinking with what manners
I might safely be admitted.

Count. You need but plead your honourable
privilege.

Laf. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter;
but I thank my God it holds yet.

*Re-enter Clown.*

Clo. O madam, yonder’s my lord your son
with a patch of velvet on’s face. Whether there
be a scar under ’t or no, the velvet knows; but
’tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek
is worn bare.

Laf. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a
good livery of honour; so belike is that.

Clo. But it is your carbonadoed face.

Laf. Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long
to talk with the young noble soldier.

Clo. Faith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate
fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow
the head and nod at every man. *Exeunt.*

# ACT V

### Scene i. Marseilles: a street
*Enter Helena, Widow, and Diana, with two Attendants.*

Hel. But this exceeding posting day and night
Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
But since you have made the days and nights as
one,
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
Be bold you do so grow in my requital
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

*Enter a Gentleman, a Stranger.*

This man may help me to his Majesty’s ear,
If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

Gent. And you.

Hel. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

Gent. I have been sometimes there.

Hel. I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
From the report that goes upon your goodness;
And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
The use of your own virtues, for the which
I shall continue thankful.

Gent. What’s your will?

Hel. That it will please you
To give this poor petition to the King,
And aid me with that store of power you have
To come into his presence.

Gent. The King’s not here.

Hel. Not here, sir!

Gent. Not, indeed.
He hence removed last night and with more haste
Than is his use.

Wid. Lord, how we lose our pains!

Hel. All’s well that ends well yet,
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

Gent. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon,
Whither I am going.

Hel. I do beseech you, sir,
Since you are like to see the King before me,
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
Which I presume shall render you no blame
But rather make you thank your pains for it.
I will come after you with what good speed
Our means will make us means.

Gent. This I’ll do for you.

Hel. And you shall find yourself to be well
thank’d,
Whate’er falls more. We must to horse again.
Go, go, provide. *Exeunt.*

### Scene ii. Rousillon: before the Count's palace
*Enter Clown, and Parolles, following.*

Par. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord
Lafeu this letter. I have ere now, sir, been better
known to you, when I have held familiarity with
fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in
fortune’s mood, and smell somewhat strong of
her strong displeasure.

Clo. Truly, fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish,
if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of. I will
henceforth eat no fish of fortune’s buttering.
Prithee, allow the wind.

Par. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir;
I spake but by a metaphor.

Clo. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will
stop my nose; or against any man’s metaphor.
Prithee, get thee further.

Par. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

Clo. Foh! prithee, stand away. A paper from
fortune’s close-stool to give to a nobleman!
Look, here he comes himself.

*Enter Lafeu.*

Here is a parr of fortune’s, sir, or of fortune’s cat
— but not a musk-cat — that has fallen into the
unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the
carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do
pity his distress in my similes of comfort and
leave him to your lordship. *Exit.*

Par. My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath
cruelly scratched.

Laf. And what would you have me to do? ’Tis
too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have
you played the knave with fortune, that she
would scratch you, who of herself is a good lady
and would not have knaves thrive long under
her? There’s a *quart d'ecu* for you. Let the
justices make you and fortune friends. I am for
other business.

Par. I beseech your honour to hear me one
single word.

Laf. You beg a single penny more. Come, you
shall ha’t; save your word.

Par. My name, my good Lord, is Parolles.

Laf. You beg more than “word,” then. Cox
my passion! give me your hand. How does your
drum?

Par. O my good lord, you were the first that
found me!

Laf. Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that
lost thee.

Par. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in
some grace, for you did bring me out.

Laf. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon
me at once both the office of God and the devil?
One brings thee in grace and the other brings
thee out. *Trumpets sound.* The King’s coming;
I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further
after me; I had talk of you last night. Though
you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to,
follow.

Par. I praise God for you. *Exeunt.*

### Scene iii. Rousillon: the Count's palace
*Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafeu, the two French Lords, with Attendants.*

King. We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
As mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know
Her estimation home.

Count. ’Tis past, my liege;
And I beseech your Majesty to make it
Natural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth;
When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,
O’erbears it and burns on.

King. My honour’d lady,
I have forgiven and forgotten all;
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
And watch’d the time to shoot.

Laf. This I must say,
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady
Offence of mighty note; but to himself
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to
serve
Humbly call’d mistress.

King. Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him
hither;
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
The nature of his great offence is dead,
And deeper than oblivion we do bury
The incensing relics of it. Let him approach,
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
So ’tis our will he should.

First Lord. I shall, my liege. *Exit.*

King. What says he to your daughter? have
you spoke?

Laf. All that he is hath reference to your highness.

King. Then shall we have a match. I have
letters sent me
That set him high in fame.

*Enter Bertram.*

Laf. He looks well on’t.

King. I am not a day of season,
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once; but to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
The time is fair again.

Ber. My high-repented blames,
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

King. All is whole;
Not one word more of the consumed time.
Let’s take the instant by the forward top;
For we are old, and on our quickest decrees
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
The daughter of this lord?

Ber. Admiringly, my liege, at first
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
Which warp’d the line of every other favour;
Scorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen;
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object; thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
The dust that did offend it.

King. Well excused.
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores
away
From the great compt; but love that comes too
late,
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
To the great sender turns a sour offence,
Crying, “That’s good that’s gone.” Our rash
faults
Make trivial price of serious things we have,
Not knowing them until we know their grave.
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust.
Our own love waking cries to see what’s done.
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
The main consents are had; and here we’ll stay
To see our widower’s second marriage day.

Count. Which better than the first, O dear
heaven, bless!
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cease!

Laf. Come on, my son, in whom my house’s
name
Must be digested, give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
That she may quickly come. *Bertram gives a ring.* By my old beard,
And every hair that’s on’t, Helen, that’s dead,
Was a sweet creature. Such a ring as this,
The last that e’er I took her leave at court,
I saw upon her finger.

Ber. Hers it was not.

King. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine
eye,
While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to’t.
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
Necessitied to help, that by this token
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
her
Of what should stead her most?

Ber. My gracious sovereign,
Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,
The ring was never hers.

Count. Son, on my life,
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it
At her life’s rate.

Laf. I am sure I saw her wear it.

Ber. You are deceived, my lord; she never saw
it.
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name
Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
I stood engaged; but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and inform’d her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture, she ceased
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again.

King. Plutus himself,
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
Hath not in nature’s mystery more science
Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas
Helen’s,
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
That you are well acquainted with yourself,
Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
You got it from her. She call’d the saints to
surety
That she would never put it from her finger,
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
Where you have never come, or sent it us
Upon her great disaster.

Ber. She never saw it.

King. Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine
honour;
And makest conjectural fears to come into me,
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
That thou art so inhuman — ’twill not prove so —
And yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe.
More than to see this ring. Take him away.
*Guards seize Bertram.*

My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him!
We’ll sift this matter further.

Ber. If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was. *Exit, guarded.*

King. I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.

*Enter a Gentleman.*

Gent. Gracious sovereign,
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.
Here’s a petition from a Florentine,
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
Is here attending. Her business looks in her
With an importing visage; and she told me,
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
Your Highness with herself.

King. *Reads*
> “Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower. His vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. Diana Capilet”

Laf. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and
toll for this. I’ll none of him.

King. The heavens have thought well on thee,
Lafeu,
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors.
Go speedily and bring again the Count.
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
Was foully snatch’d.

Count. Now, justice on the doers!

*Re-enter Bertram, guarded.*

King. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to
you,
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
Yet you desire to marry.

*Enter Widow and Diana.*

Dia. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
Derived from the ancient Capilet.
My suit, as I do understand, you know,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Wid. I am her mother, sir, whose age and
honour
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

King. Come hither, Count; do you know these
women?

Ber. My lord, I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them. Do they charge me further?

Dia. Why do you look so strange upon your
wife?

Ber. She’s none of mine, my lord.

Dia. If you shall marry,
You give away this hand, and that is mine;
You give away heaven’s vows, and those are
mine;
You give away myself, which is known mine;
For I by vow am so embodied yours,
That she which marries you must marry me,
Either both or none.

Laf. Your reputation comes too short for my
daughter; you are no husband for her.

Ber. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
Whom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your
Highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

King. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to
friend
Till your deeds gain them; fairer prove your
honour
Than in my thought it lies.

Dia. Good my lord,
Ask him upon his oath if he does think
He had not my virginity.

King. What say’st thou to her?

Ber. She’s impudent, my lord.
And was a common gamester to the camp.

Dia. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
He might have bought me at a common price.
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o’ the camp,
If I be one.

Count. He blushes, and ’tis it.
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
Conferr’d by testament to the sequent issue,
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
That ring’s a thousand proofs.

King. Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it.

Dia. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument. His name’s Parolles.

Laf. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

King. Find him, and bring him hither.
*Exit an Attendant.*

Ber. What of him?
He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,
With all the spots o’ the world tax’d and deboshed;
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,
That will speak anything?

King. She hath that ring of yours.

Ber. I think she has. Certain it is I liked her,
And boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth.
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancy’s course
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring;
And I had that which any inferior might
At market-price have bought.

Dia. I must be patient.
You, that have turn’d off a first so noble wife,
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again.

Ber. I have it not.

King. What ring was yours, I pray you?

Dia. Sir, much like
The same upon your finger.

King. Know you this ring? this ring was his of
late.

Dia. And this was it I gave him, being abed.

King. The story then goes false, you threw it
him
Out of a casement.

Dia. I have spoke the truth.

*Enter Parolles.*

Ber. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

King. You boggle shrewdly, every feather
starts you.
Is this the man you speak of?

Dia. Ay, my lord.

King. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge
you,
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
Which on your just proceeding I’ll keep off,
By him and by this woman here what know you?

Par. So please your Majesty, my master hath
been an honourable gentleman. Tricks he hath
had in him, which gentlemen have.

King. Come, come, to the purpose. Did he love
this woman?

Par. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

King. How, I pray you?

Par. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a
woman.

King. How is that?

Par. He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

King. As thou art a knave, and no knave. What
an equivocal companion is this!

Par. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty’s
command.

Laf. He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty
orator.

Dia. Do you know he promised me marriage?

Par. Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.

King. But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

Par. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between
them, as I said; but more than that, he
loved her; for indeed he was mad for her, and
talked of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I
know not what; yet I was in that credit with

SCENE III.

them at that time that I knew of their going to
bed, and of other motions, as promising her mar-
riage, and things which would derive me ill will
to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I
know.

King. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou
canst say they are married; but thou art too fine
in thy evidence; therefore stand aside.
This ring, you say, was yours?

Dia. Ay, my good lord.

King. Where did you buy it? or who gave it
you?

Dia. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

King. Who lent it you?

Dia. It was not lent me neither.

King. Where did you find it, then?

Dia. I found it not.

King. If it were yours by none of all these ways,
How could you give it him?

Dia. I never gave it him.

Laf. This woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she
goes off and on at pleasure.

King. This ring was mine; I gave it his first
wife.

Dia. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

King. Take her away; I do not like her now;
To prison with her; and away with him.
Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,
Thou diest within this hour.

Dia. I’ll never tell you.

King. Take her away.

Dia. I’ll put in bail, my liege.

King. I think thee now some common cus-
tomer.

Dia. By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.

King. Wherefore hast thou accused him all this
while?

Dia. Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty;
He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t:
I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.

King. She does abuse our ears. To prison with
her.

Dia. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal
sir.
[Exit Widow.
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him.
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
And at that time he got his wife with child.
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.
So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick:
And now behold the meaning.

[Re-enter Widow, with Helena.

King. Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is’t real that I see?

Hel. No, my good lord;
’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
The name and not the thing.

Ber. Both, both. O, pardon!

Hel. O my good lord, when I was like this
maid,
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
And, look you, here’s your letter; this it says:
“When from my finger you can get this ring
And are by me with child,” &c. This is done.
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

Ber. If she, my liege, can make me know this
clearly,
I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

Hel. If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
Deadly divorce step between me and you!
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

Laf. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep
anon:
[To Parolles] Good Tom Drum, lend me a
handkercher. So,
I thank thee; wait on me home, I’ll make sport
with thee.
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

King. Let us from point to point this story
know,
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
[To Diana] If thou be’st yet a fresh uncropped
flower,
Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower;
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Of that and all the progress, more and less,
Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

[Flourish.

### EPILOGUE

King. The king’s a beggar, now the play is
done.
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
That you express content; which we will pay,
With trifle to please you, day exceeding day.
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

[Exeunt.

### ACT I

#### Scene i. An apartment in the Duke's palace

[Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords and Attendants.]

Duke. Escalus.

Escal. My lord.

Duke. Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and dis-
course;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you. Then no more re-
mains,
But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city’s institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you’re as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call
hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.

[Exit an Attendant.]

What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress’d him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power. What think you of it?

Escal. If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

Duke. Look where he comes.

[Enter Angelo.]

Ang. Always obedient to your Grace’s will,
I come to know your pleasure.

Duke. Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely
touch’d
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

Ang. Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp’d upon it.

Duke. No more evasion.
We have with a leaven’d and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion’d
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

Ang. Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

Duke. My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
I’ll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes.
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and *Aves* vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

Ang. The heavens give safety to your purposes!

Escal. Lead forth and bring you back in happi-
ness!

Duke. I thank you. Fare you well.

[Exit.]

Escal. I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns
me
To look into the bottom of my place.
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

Ang. ’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw to-
gether,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

Escal. I’ll wait upon your honour.

#### Scene ii. A street

[Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.]

Lucio. If the Duke with the other dukes come
not to composition with the King of Hungary,
why then all the dukes fall upon the King.

1st Gent. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the
King of Hungary’s!

2nd Gent. Amen.

Lucio. Thou concludest like the sanctimonious
pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Command-
ments, but scraped one out of the table.

2nd Gent. “Thou shalt not steal”?

Lucio. Ay, that he razed.

1st Gent. Why, ’twas a commandment to com-
mand the captain and all the rest from their func-
tions; they put forth to steal. There’s not a sol-
dier of us all, that, in the thanksgiving before
meat, do relish the petition well that prays for
peace.

2nd Gent. I never heard any soldier dislike it.

Lucio. I believe thee; for I think thou never
wast where grace was said.

2nd Gent. No? a dozen times at least.

1st Gent. What, in metre?

Lucio. In any proportion or in any language.

1st Gent. I think, or in any religion.

Lucio. Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of
all controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art
a wicked villain, despite of all grace.

1st Gent. Well, there went but a pair of shears
between us.

Lucio. I grant; as there may between the lists
and the velvet. Thou art the list.

1st Gent. And thou the velvet. Thou art good
velvet; thou’rt a three-piled piece, I warrant
thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey
as be piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet.
Do I speak feelingly now?

Lucio. I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most
painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine
own confession, learn to begin thy health; but,
whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

1st Gent. I think I have done myself wrong, have
I not?

2nd Gent. Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art
tainted or free.

Lucio. Behold, behold, where Madam Mitiga-
tion comes! I have purchased as many diseases
under her roof as come to—

2nd Gent. To what, I pray?

Lucio. Judge.

2nd Gent. To three thousand dolours a year.

1st Gent. Ay, and more.

Lucio. A French crown more.

1st Gent. Thou art always figuring diseases in
me; but thou art full of error; I am sound.

Lucio. Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but
so sound as things that are hollow. Thy bones
are hollow; impiety has made a feast of thee.

[Enter Mistress Overdone.]

1st Gent. How now! which of your hips has the
most profound sciatica?

Mrs. Ov. Well, well; there’s one yonder arrest-
ed and carried to prison was worth five thousand
of you all.

2nd Gent. Who’s that, I pray thee?

Mrs. Ov. Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior
Claudio.

1st Gent. Claudio to prison? ’tis not so.

Mrs. Ov. Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him
arrested, saw him carried away; and, which is
more, within these three days his head to be
chopped off.

Lucio. But, after all this fooling, I would not
have it so. Art thou sure of this?
