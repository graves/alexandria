## ACT I

### Scene i. The Duke's palace
Enter Duke, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians attending.

Duke. If music be the food of love, play on;
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so die.
That strain again! it had a dying fall:
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
But falls into abatement and low price,
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical.

Cur. Will you go hunt, my lord?

Duke. What, Curio?

Cur. The hart.

Duke. Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
E'er since pursue me.

Enter Valentine.

How now! what news from her?

Val. So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
But from her handmaid do return this answer:
The element itself, till seven years' heat,
Shall not behold her face at ample view;
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
And water once a day her chamber round
With eye-offending brine: all this to season
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
And lasting in her sad remembrance.

Duke. O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
Her sweet perfections with one self king!
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with
bowers.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene ii. The sea-coast
Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.

Vio. What country, friends, is this?

Cap. This is Illyria, lady.

Vio. And what should I do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you,
sailors?

Cap. It is perchance that you yourself were
saved.

Vio. O my poor brother! and so perchance may
he be.

Cap. True, madam: and, to comfort you with
chance,
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
When you and those poor numbers saved with
you
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Most provident in peril, bind himself,
Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see.

Vio. For saying so, there's gold:
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

Cap. Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
Not three hours' travel from this very place.

Vio. Who governs here?

Cap. A noble duke, in nature as in name.

Vio. What is his name?

Cap. Orsino.

Vio. Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
He was a bachelor then.

Cap. And so is now, or was so very late;
For but a month ago I went from hence,
And then 'twas fresh in murmur—as, you know,
What great ones do the less will prattle of—
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

Vio. What's she?

Cap. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving
her
In the protection of his son, her brother,
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
They say, she hath abjured the company
And sight of men.

Vio. O that I served that lady
And might not be delivered to the world,
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
What my estate is!

Cap. That were hard to compass;
Because she will admit no kind of suit,
No, not the Duke's.

Vio. There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall become
The form of my intent. I'll serve this Duke:
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him:
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music
That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap to time I will commit;
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

Cap. Be you his eunuch, and your mute
I'll be:
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not
see.

Vio. I thank thee: lead me on.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene iii. Olivia's house
Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.

Sir To. What a plague means my niece, to take
the death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an
enemy to life.

Mar. By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in
earlier o' nights: your cousin, my lady, takes
great exceptions to your ill hours.

Sir To. Why, let her except, before excepted.

Mar. Ay, but you must confine yourself within
the modest limits of order.

Sir To. Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than
I am: these clothes are good enough to drink in;
and so be these boots too: an they be not, let
them hang themselves in their own straps.

Mar. That quaffing and drinking will undo you:
I heard my lady talk of it yesterday: and of a
foolish knight that you brought in one night here
to be her wooer.

Sir To. Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

Mar. Ay, he.

Sir To. He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.

Mar. What's that to the purpose?

Sir To. Why, he has three thousand ducats a
year.

Mar. Ay, he'll have but a year in all these
ducats: he's a very fool and a prodigal.

Sir To. Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
*viol-de-gamboys*, and speaks three or four lan¬
guages word for word without book, and hath
all the good gifts of nature.

Mar. He hath indeed, almost natural: for be¬
sides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller; and
but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the
gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among
the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a
grave.

Sir To. By this hand, they are scoundrels and
substractors that say so of him. Who are they?

Mar. They that add, moreover, he's drunk
nightly in your company.

Sir To. With drinking healths to my niece: I'll
drink to her as long as there is a passage in my
throat and drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a
coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his
brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top. What,
wench! *Castiliano vulgo!* for here comes Sir
Andrew Agueface.

Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.

Sir And. Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby
Belch!

Sir To. Sweet Sir Andrew!

Sir And. Bless you, fair shrew.

Mar. And you too, sir.

Sir To. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

Sir And. What's that?

Sir To. My niece's chambermaid.

Sir And. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better
acquaintance.

Mar. My name is Mary, sir.

Sir And. Good Mistress Mary Accost—

Sir To. You mistake, knight: “accost” is front
her, board her, woo her, assail her.

Sir And. By my troth, I would not undertake
her in this company. Is that the meaning of
“accost”?

Mar. Fare you well, gentlemen.

Sir To. An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would
thou mightst never draw sword again.

Sir And. An you part so, mistress, I would I
might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you
think you have fools in hand?

Mar. Sir, I have not you by the hand.

Sir And. Marry, but you shall have; and here's
my hand.

Mar. Now, sir, “thought is free.” I pray you,
bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it
drink.

Sir And. Wherefore, sweetheart? what's your
metaphor?

Mar. It's dry, sir.

Sir And. Why, I think so: I am not such an ass
but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your
jest?

Mar. A dry jest, sir.

Sir And. Are you full of them?

Mar. Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends:
marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.
[Exit.]

Sir To. O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary:
when did I see thee so put down?

Sir And. Never in your life, I think; unless you
see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes
I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordi¬
nary man has: but I am a great eater of beef and
I believe that does harm to my wit.

Sir To. No question.

Sir And. An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll
ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.

Sir To. *Pourquoi*, my dear knight?

Sir And. What is *pourquoi*? do or not do? I
would I had bestowed that time in the tongues
that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting:
O, had I but followed the arts!

Sir To. Then hadst thou had an excellent head
of hair.

Sir And. Why, would that have mended my
hair?

Sir To. Past question; for thou seest it will not
curl by nature.

Sir And. But it becomes me well enough, does't
not?

Sir To. Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff;
and I hope to see a housewife take thee between
her legs and spin it off.

Sir And. Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby:
your niece will not be seen; or if she be, it's four
to one she'll none of me: the Count himself here
hard by woos her.

Sir To. She'll none o' the Count: she'll not
match above her degree, neither in estate, years,
nor wit; I have heard her swear't. Tut, there's
life in't, man.

Sir And. I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow
o' the strangest mind i' the world; I delight in
masques and revels sometimes altogether.

Sir To. Art thou good at these kickshawses,
knight?

Sir And. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he
be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will
not compare with an old man.

Sir To. What is thy excellence in a galliard,
knight?

Sir And. Faith, I can cut a caper.

Sir To. And I can cut the mutton to't.

Sir And. And I think I have the back-trick
simply as strong as any man in Illyria.

Sir To. Wherefore are these things hid? where¬
fore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? are
they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's pic¬
ture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard
and come home in a coranto? My very walk
should be a jig; I would not so much as make
water but in a *sink-a-pace*. What dost thou mean?
Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the
excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed
under the star of a galliard.

Sir And. Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent
well in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about
some revels?

Sir To. What shall we do else? were we not
born under Taurus?

Sir And. Taurus! That's sides and heart.

Sir To. No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see
thee caper: ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
[Exeunt.]

### Scene iv. The Duke's palace
Enter Valentine, and Viola in man's attire.

Val. If the Duke continue these favours towards
you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced:
he hath known you but three days, and already
you are no stranger.

Vio. You either fear his humour or my negli¬
gence, that you call in question the continuance
of his love: is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

Val. No, believe me.

Vio. I thank you. Here comes the Count.

Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants.

Duke. Who saw Cesario, ho?

Vio. On your attendance, my lord; here.

Duke. Stand you a while aloof. Cesario,
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
To thee the book even of my secret soul:
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience.

Vio. Sure, my noble lord,
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

Duke. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
Rather than make unprofited return.

Vio. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what
then?

Duke. O, then unfold the passion of my love,
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
It shall become thee well to act my woes;
She will attend it better in thy youth
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.

Vio. I think not so, my lord.

Duke. Dear lad, believe it;
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
And all is semblative a woman's part.
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
All, if you will; for I myself am best
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
To call his fortunes thine.

Vio. I'll do my best
To woo your lady: [Aside] yet, a barful strife!
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene v. Olivia's house
Enter Maria and Clown.

Mar. Nay, either tell me where thou hast been,
or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may
enter in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang
thee for thy absence.

Clo. Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in
this world needs to fear no colours.

Mar. Make that good.

Clo. He shall see none to fear.

Mar. A good lenten answer: I can tell thee
where that saying was born, of “I fear no
colours.”

Clo. Where, good Mistress Mary?

Mar. In the wars; and that may you be bold to
say in your foolery.

Clo. Well, God give them wisdom that have it;
and those that are fools, let them use their talents.

Mar. Yet you will be hanged for being so long
absent; or to be turned away, is not that as good
as a hanging to you?

Clo. Many a good hanging prevents a bad mar¬
riage; and, for turning away, let summer bear it
out.

Mar. You are resolute, then?

Clo. Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two
points.

Mar. That if one break, the other will hold; or,
if both break, your gaskins fall.

Clo. Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy
way; if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou
wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in
Illyria.

Mar. Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here
comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you
were best.
[Exit.]

Clo. Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good
fooling! Those wits, that think they have thee,
do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I
lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what
says Quinapalus? “Better a witty fool than a
foolish wit.”

Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio.

God bless thee, lady!

Oli. Take the fool away.

Clo. Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the
lady.

Oli. Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of
you: besides, you grow dishonest.

Clo. Two faults, madonna, that drink and good
counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink,
then is the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man
mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer dis¬
honest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him.
Any thing that's mended is but patched: virtue
that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin
that amends is but patched with virtue. If that
this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade
take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take
her away.

Oli. Sir, I bade them take away you.

Clo. Misprision in the highest degree! Lady,
*cucullus non facit monachum*; that's as much to say
as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna,
give me leave to prove you a fool.

Oli. Can you do it?

Clo. Dexteriously, good madonna.

Oli. Make your proof.

Clo. I must catechize you for it, madonna: good
my mouse of virtue, answer me.

Oli. Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll
bide your proof.

Clo. Good madonna, why mournest thou?

Oli. Good fool, for my brother's death.

Clo. I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

Oli. I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

Clo. The more fool, madonna, to mourn for
your brother's soul being in heaven. Take away
the fool, gentlemen.

Oli. What think you of this fool, Malvolio?
doth he not mend?

Mal. Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death
shall seize him: infirmity, that decays the wise, doth
ever make the better fool.

Clo. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for
the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
word for two pence that you are no fool.

Oli. How say you to that, Malvolio?

Mal. I marvel your ladyship takes delight in
such a barren rascal: I saw him put down the
other day with an ordinary fool that has no more
brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of
his guard already; unless you laugh and minister
occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest, I take
these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of
fools, no better than the fools' zanies.

Oli. O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and
taste with a distempered appetite. To be gene¬
rous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take
those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-
bullets: there is no slander in an allowed fool,
though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in
a known discreet man, though he do nothing but
reprove.

Clo. Now Mercury endue thee with leasing,
for thou speakest well of fools!

Re-enter Maria.

Mar. Madam, there is at the gate a young gentle¬
man much desires to speak with you.

Oli. From the Count Orsino, is it?

Mar. I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man,
and well attended.

Oli. Who of my people hold him in delay?

Mar. Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

Oli. Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks
nothing but madman: fie on him!
[Exit Maria.]
Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the Count,
I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dis¬
miss it.
[Exit Malvolio.]
Now you see, sir, how
your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.

Clo. Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy
eldest son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram
with brains! for—here he comes—one of thy kin
has a most weak *pia mater*.

Enter Sir Toby.

Oli. By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at
the gate, cousin?

Sir To. A gentleman.

Oli. A gentleman! what gentleman?

Sir To. 'Tis a gentleman here—a plague o' these
pickle-herring! How now, sot!

Clo. Good Sir Toby!

Oli. Cousin, cousin, how have you come so
early by this lethargy?

Sir To. Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at
the gate.

Oli. Ay, marry, what is he?

Sir To. Let him be the devil, an he will, I care
not: give me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
[Exit.]

Oli. What's a drunken man like, fool?

Clo. Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman:
one draught above heat makes him a fool;
the second mads him; and a third drowns him.

Oli. Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him
sit o' my coz; for he's in the third degree of
drink, he's drowned: go, look after him.

Clo. He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool
shall look to the madman.
[Exit.]

Re-enter Malvolio.

Mal. Madam, yond young fellow swears he will
speak with you. I told him you were sick; he
takes on him to understand so much, and there¬
fore comes to speak with you. I told him you
were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge
of that too, and therefore comes to speak with
you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's forti¬
fied against any denial.

Oli. Tell him he shall not speak with me.

Mal. Has been told so; and he says he'll stand
at your door like a sheriff's post and be the sup¬
porter to a bench, but he'll speak with you.

Oli. What kind o' man is he?

Mal. Why, of mankind.

Oli. What manner of man?

Mal. Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you,
will you or no.

Oli. Of what personage and years is he?

Mal. Not yet old enough for a man, nor young
enough for a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a
peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple:
'tis with him in standing water, between boy and
man. He is very well-favoured and he speaks
very shrewishly; one would think his mother's
milk were scarce out of him.

Oli. Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

Mal. Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
[Exit.]

Re-enter Maria.

Oli. Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my
face.
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

Enter Viola, and Attendants.

Vio. The honourable lady of the house, which
is she?

Oli. Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your
will?

Vio. Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable
beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of
the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath
to cast away my speech, for besides that it is
excellently well penned, I have taken great pains
to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn;
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister
usage.

Oli. Whence came you, sir?

Vio. I can say little more than I have studied,
and that question's out of my part. Good gentle
one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady
of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.

Oli. Are you a comedian?

Vio. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the
very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play.
Are you the lady of the house?

Oli. If I do not usurp myself, I am.

Vio. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not
yours to reserve. But this is from my commis¬
sion: I will on with my speech in your praise,
and then show you the heart of my message.

Oli. Come to what is important in't: I forgive
you the praise.

Vio. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis
poetical.

Oli. It is the more like to be feigned: I pray
you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my
gates, and allowed your approach rather to won¬
der at you than to hear you. If you be not mad,
be gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not
that time of moon with me to make one in so
skipping a dialogue.

Mar. Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your
way.

Vio. No, good swabber; I am to hull here a
little longer. Some mollification for your giant,
sweet lady. Tell me your mind: I am a mes¬
senger.

Oli. Sure, you have some hideous matter to
deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful.
Speak your office.

Vio. It alone concerns your ear. I bring no
overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold
the olive in my hand; my words are as full of
peace as matter.

Oli. Yet you began rudely. What are you?
what would you?

Vio. The rudeness that hath appeared in me
have I learned from my entertainment. What I
am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden¬
head; to your ears, divinity, to any other's pro¬
fanation.

Oli. Give us the place alone: we will hear this
divinity.
[Exeunt Maria and Attendants.]
Now,
sir, what is your text?

Vio. Most sweet lady—

Oli. A comfortable doctrine, and much may be
said of it. Where lies your text?

Vio. In Orsino's bosom.

Oli. In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

Vio. To answer by the method, in the first of
his heart.

Oli. O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you
no more to say?

Vio. Good madam, let me see your face.

Oli. Have you any commission from your lord
to negotiate with my face? You are now out of
your text: but we will draw the curtain and show
you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was
this present: is't not well done?
[Unveiling.]

Vio. Excellently done, if God did all.

Oli. 'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and
weather.

Vio. 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and
white
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
If you will lead these graces to the grave
And leave the world no copy.

Oli. O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will
give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall
be inventoried, and every particle and utensil
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips, indifferent
red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them;
item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you
sent hither to praise me?

Vio. I see you what you are, you are too
proud;
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
My lord and master loves you. O such love
Could be but recompensed, though you were
crown'd
The nonpareil of beauty!

Oli. How does he love me?

Vio. With adorations, fertile tears,
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

Oli. Your lord does know my mind; I cannot
love him:
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
In voices well divulged, free, learn'd, and valiant;
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
He might have took his answer long ago.

Vio. If I did love you in my master's flame,
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
In your denial I would find no sense;
I would not understand it.

Oli. Why, what would you?

Vio. Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
And call upon my soul within the house;
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Cry out “Olivia!” O, you should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth,
But you should pity me!

Oli. You might do much.
What is your parentage?

Vio. Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
I am a gentleman.

Oli. Get you to your lord:
I cannot love him: let him send no more;
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.

Vio. I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
And let your fervour, like my master's, be
Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
[Exit.]

Oli. “What is your parentage?”
“Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
I am a gentleman.” I'll be sworn thou art;
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and
spirit,
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast: soft,
soft!
Unless the master were the man. How now!
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

With an invisible and subtle stealth
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.

What ho, Malvolio!

*Re-enter Malvolio.*

Mal. Here, madam, at your service.

Oli. Run after that same peevish messenger,
  The County's man: he left this ring behind him,
  Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
  Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
  Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
  If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
  I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.

Mal. Madam, I will. *[Exit.]*

Oli. I do I know not what, and fear to find
  Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
  Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
  What is decreed must be, and be this so. *[Exit.]*

## ACT II

### Scene i. The sea-coast

*Enter Antonio and Sebastian.*

Ant. Will you stay no longer? nor will you not
that I go with you?

Seb. By your patience, no. My stars shine
darkly over me: the malignancy of my fate might
perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave
of your leave that I may bear my evils alone:
it were a bad recompense for your love, to lay
any of them on you.

Ant. Let me yet know of you whither you are
bound.

Seb. No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is
mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so ex-
cellent a touch of modesty that you will not
extort from me what I am willing to keep in;
therefore it charges me in manners the rather to
express myself. You must know of me then, An-
tonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Rode-
rigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline,
whom I know you have heard of. He left behind
him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if
the heavens had been pleased, would we had so
ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour
before you took me from the breach of the sea
was my sister drowned.

Ant. Alas the day!

Seb. A lady, sir, though it was said she much
resembled me, was yet of many accounted beau-
tiful: but, though I could not with such estimable
wonder over far believe that, yet thus far I will
boldly publish her; she bore a mind that envy
could not but call fair. She is drowned already,
sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her
remembrance again with more.

Ant. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

Seb. O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

Ant. If you will not murder me for my love, let
me be your servant.

Seb. If you will not undo what you have done,
that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire
it not. Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full
of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of
my mother, that upon the least occasion more
mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to
the Count Orsino’s court: farewell. *[Exit.]*

Ant. The gentleness of all the gods go with
  thee!
  I have many enemies in Orsino’s court,
  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
  But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
  That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
*[Exit.]*

### Scene ii. A street

*Enter Viola, Malvolio following.*

Mal. Were not you even now with the Countess
Olivia?

Vio. Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have
since arrived but hither.

Mal. She returns this ring to you, sir: you
might have saved me my pains, to have taken it
away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you
should put your lord into a desperate assurance
she will none of him: and one thing more, that
you be never so hardy to come again in his af-
fairs, unless it be to report your lord’s taking of
this. Receive it so.

Vio. She took the ring of me: I’ll none of it.

Mal. Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her;
and her will is, it should be so returned: if it be
worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if
not, be it his that finds it. *[Exit.]*

Vio. I left no ring with her: what means this
  lady?
  Fortune forbid my outside have not charm’d her!
  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
  That sure methought her eyes had lost her ton-
  gue,
  For she did speak in starts distractedly.
  She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
  Invites me in this churlish messenger.
  None of my lord’s ring! why, he sent her none.
  I am the man: if it be so, as ’tis,
  Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
  Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
  Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
  How easy is it for the proper-false
  In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!
  Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
  For such as we are made of, such we be.
  How will this fadge? my master loves her
  dearly;
  And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
  And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
  What will become of this? As I am man,
  My state is desperate for my master’s love;
  As I am woman—now alas the day!—
  What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
  O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
  It is too hard a knot for me to untie! *[Exit.]*

### Scene iii. Olivia's house

*Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.*

Sir To. Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed
after midnight is to be up betimes; and "*udiluculo
surgere*," thou know’st—

Sir And. Nay, by my troth, I know not: but I
know, to be up late is to be up late.

Sir To. A false conclusion: I hate it as an un-
filled can. To be up after midnight and to go to
bed then, is early: so that to go to bed after mid-
night is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life
consist of the four elements?

Sir And. Faith, so they say; but I think it rather
consists of eating and drinking.

Sir To. Thou’rt a scholar; let us therefore eat
and drink. Maria, I say! a stoup of wine!

*Enter Clown.*

Sir And. Here comes the fool, i’ faith.

Clo. How now, my hearts! did you never see
the picture of “we three”?

Sir To. Welcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch.

Sir And. By my troth, the fool has an excellent
breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had
such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the
fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious
fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigro-
gromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial
of Queubus: ’twas very good, i’ faith. I sent thee
sixpence for thy leman: hadst it?

Clo. I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvo-
lio’s nose is no whipstock: my lady has a white
hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale
houses.

Sir And. Excellent! why, this is the best fooling,
when all is done. Now, a song.

Sir To. Come on; there is sixpence for you: let’s
have a song.

Sir And. There’s a testril of me too: if one
knight give a—

Clo. Would you have a love-song, or a song of
good life?

Sir To. A love-song, a love-song.

Sir And. Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

Clo. *[Sings]*
  “O mistress, where are you roaming?
  O, stay and hear; your true love’s coming,
  That can sing both high and low:
  Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
  Journeys end in lovers meeting,
  Every wise man’s son doth know.”

Sir And. Excellent good, i’ faith.

Sir To. Good, good.

Clo. *[Sings]*
  “What is love? ’tis not hereafter;
  Present mirth hath present laughter;
  What’s to come is still unsure:
  In delay there lies no plenty;
  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
  Youth’s a stuff will not endure.”

Sir And. A mellifluous voice, as I am true
knight.

Sir To. A contagious breath.

Sir And. Very sweet and contagious, i’ faith.

Sir To. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in con-
tagion. But shall we make the welkin dance in-
deed? shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that
will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall
we do that?

Sir And. An you love me, let’s do’t: I am dog at
a catch.

Clo. By’r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch
well.

Sir And. Most certain. Let our catch be, “Thou
knave.”

Clo. “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight? I
shall be constrained in’t to call thee knave,
knight.

Sir And. ’Tis not the first time I have con-
strained one to call me knave. Begin, fool: it
begins “Hold thy peace.”

Clo. I shall never begin if I hold my peace.

Sir And. Good, i’ faith. Come, begin.

*Catch sung.*

*Enter Maria.*

Mar. What a caterwauling do you keep here!
If my lady have not called up her steward Mal-
volio and bid him turn you out of doors, never
trust me.

Sir To. My lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians,
Malvolio’s a Peg-a-Ramsey, and “Three merry
men be we.” Am not I consanguineous? am I not
of her blood? Tilly-vally. Lady! *[Sings]*
“There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!”

Clo. Beshrew me, the knight’s in admirable
fooling.

Sir And. Ay, he does well enough if he be dis-
posed, and so do I too: he does it with a better
grace, but I do it more natural.

Sir To. *[Sings]* “O, the twelfth day of Decem-
ber”—

Mar. For the love o’ God, peace!

*Enter Malvolio.*

Mal. My masters, are you mad? or what are
you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty,
but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?
Do ye make an alehouse of my lady’s house, that
ye squeak out your coziers’ catches without any
mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no
respect of place, persons, nor time in you?

Sir To. We did keep time, sir, in our catches.
Sneck up!

Mal. Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My
lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbours
you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your
disorders. If you can separate yourself and your
misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house;
if not, an it would please you to take leave of her,
she is very willing to bid you farewell.

Sir To. “Farewell, dear heart, since I must
needs be gone.”

Mar. Nay, good Sir Toby.

Clo. “His eyes do show his days are almost
done.”

Mal. Is’t even so?

Sir To. “But I will never die.”

Clo. Sir Toby, there you lie.

Mal. This is much credit to you.

Sir To. “Shall I bid him go?”

Clo. “What an if you do?”

Sir To. “Shall I bid him go, and spare not?”

Clo. “O no, no, no, no, you dare not.”

Sir To. Out o’ tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more
than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou
art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and
ale?

Clo. Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot
i’ the mouth too.

Sir To. Thou’rt i’ the right. Go, sir, rub your
chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!

Mal. Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s
favour at any thing more than contempt, you
would not give means for this uncivil rule: she
shall know of it, by this hand. *[Exit.]*

Mar. Go shake your ears.

Sir And. ’Twere as good a deed as to drink
when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the
field, and then to break promise with him and
make a fool of him.

Sir To. Do’t, knight: I’ll write thee a challenge;
or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of
mouth.

Mar. Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night:
since the youth of the Count’s was to-day with
my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur
Malvolio, let me alone with him: if I do not gull
him into a nayword, and make him a common
recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie
straight in my bed: I know I can do it.

Sir To. Possess us, possess us; tell us some-
thing of him.

Mar. Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of
puritan.

Sir And. O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like
a dog!

Sir To. What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite
reason, dear knight?

Sir And. I have no exquisite reason for’t, but
I have reason good enough.

Mar. The devil a puritan that he is, or any
thing constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affec-
tioned ass, that cons state without book and ut-
ters it by great swarths: the best persuaded
of himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with ex-
cellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that
all that look on him love him; and on that vice
in him will my revenge find notable cause to
work.

Sir To. What wilt thou do?

Mar. I will drop in his way some obscure
epistles of love; wherein, by the colour of his
beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait,
the expressure of his eye, forehead, and com-
plexion, he shall find himself most feelingly per-
sonated. I can write very like my lady your
niece: on a forgotten matter we can hardly make
distinction of our hands.

Sir To. Excellent! I smell a device.

Sir And. I have’t in my nose too.

Sir To. He shall think, by the letters that thou
wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and
that she’s in love with him.

Mar. My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that
colour.

Sir And. And your horse now would make him
an ass.

Mar. Ass, I doubt not.

Sir And. O, ’twill be admirable!

Mar. Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my
physic will work with him. I will plant you two,
and let the fool make a third, where he shall find
the letter: observe his construction of it. For
this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Fare-
well. *[Exit.]*

Sir To. Good night, Penthesilea.

Sir And. Before me, she’s a good wench.

Sir To. She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that
adores me: what o’ that?

Sir And. I was adored once too.

Sir To. Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need
send for more money.

Sir And. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a
foul way out.

Sir To. Send for money, knight: if thou hast her
not i’ the end, call me cut.

Sir And. If I do not, never trust me, take it how
you will.

Sir To. Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack; ’tis
too late to go to bed now: come, knight; come,
knight. *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene iv. The Duke’s palace

*Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and others.*

Duke. Give me some music. Now, good mor-
  row, friends.
  Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
  That old and antique song we heard last night:
  Methought it did relieve my passion much,
  More than light airs and recollected terms
  Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
  Come, but one verse.

Cur. He is not here, so please your lordship,
that should sing it.

Duke. Who was it?

Cur. Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the
lady Olivia’s father took much delight in. He
is about the house.

Duke. Seek him out, and play the tune the
while. *[Exit Curio. Music plays.]*
  Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
  In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
  For such as I am all true lovers are,
  Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
  Save in the constant image of the creature
  That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

Vio. It gives a very echo to the seat
  Where Love is throned.

Duke. Thou dost speak masterly:
  My life upon’t, young though thou art, thine eye
  Hath stay’d upon some favour that it loves:
  Hath it not, boy?

Vio. A little, by your favour.

Duke. What kind of woman is’t?

Vio. Of your complexion.

Duke. She is not worth thee, then. What years,
i’ faith?

Vio. About your years, my lord.

Duke. Too old, by heaven: let still the woman
  take
  An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
  So sways she level in her husband’s heart:
  For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
  Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
  More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
  Than women’s are.

Vio. I think it well, my lord.

Duke. Then let thy love be younger than thy-
  self,
  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
  For women are as roses, whose fair flower
  Being once display’d, doth fall that very hour.

Vio. And so they are: alas, that they are so;
  To die, even when they to perfection grow!

*Re-enter Curio and Clown.*

Duke. O, fellow, come, the song we had last
  night.
  Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
  The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
  And the free maids that weave their thread with
  bones
  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
  And dallies with the innocence of love,
  Like the old age.

Clo. Are you ready, sir?

Duke. Ay; prithee, sing.

*Music.*

*Song.*

Clo. “Come away, come away, death,
  And in sad cypress let me be laid;
  Fly away, fly away, breath;
  I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
  My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
  O, prepare it!
  My part of death, no one so true
  Did share it.
  Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
  On my black coffin let there be strown;
  Not a friend, not a friend greet
  My poor corpse, where my bones shall
  be thrown:
  A thousand thousand sighs to save,
  Lay me, O, where
  Sad true lover never find my grave,
  To weep there!”

Duke. There’s for thy pains.

Clo. No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing,
sir.

Duke. I’ll pay thy pleasure then.

Clo. Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one
time or another.

Duke. Give me now leave to leave thee.

Clo. Now, the melancholy god protect thee;
and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable
taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would
have men of such constancy put to sea, that
their business might be everything and their
intent everywhere; for that’s it that always
makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
*[Exit.]*

Duke. Let all the rest give place.
*[Curio and Attendants retire.]*
  Once more, Cesario,
  Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
  Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  The parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon
  her,
  Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
  But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems
  That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

Vio. But if she cannot love you, sir?

Duke. I cannot be so answer’d.

Vio. Sooth, but you must.
  Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
  Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
  As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
  You tell her so; must she not then be answer’d?

Duke. There is no woman’s sides
  Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
  As love doth give my heart; no woman’s
  heart
  So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.
  Alas, their love may be call’d appetite,
  No motion of the liver, but the palate,
  That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
  But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
  And can digest as much: make no compare
  Between that love a woman can bear me
  And that I owe Olivia.

Vio. Ay, but I know—

Duke. What dost thou know?

Vio. Too well what love women to men may
  owe:
  In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
  My father had a daughter loved a man,
  As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
  I should your lordship—

Duke. And what’s her history?

Vio. A blank, my lord. She never told her
  love,
  But let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,
  Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
  And with a green and yellow melancholy
  She sat like patience on a monument,
  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
  We men may say more, swear more: but in-
  deed
  Our shows are more than will; for still we
  prove
  Much in our vows, but little in our love.

Duke. But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

Vio. I am all the daughters of my father’s house,
  And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
  Sir, shall I to this lady?

Duke. Ay, that’s the theme.
  To her in haste; give her this jewel; say
  My love can give no place, bide no denay.
*[Exeunt.]*

### Scene v. Olivia’s garden

*Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.*

Sir To. Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

Fab. Nay, I’ll come: if I lose a scruple of
this sport, let me be boiled to death with melan-
choly.

Sir To. Wouldst thou not be glad to have the
niggardly rascal sheep-biter come by some not-
able shame?

Fab. I would exult, man: you know, he brought
me out o’ favour with my lady about a bear-bait-
ing here.

Sir To. To anger him we’ll have the bear
again; and we will fool him black and blue: shall
we not, Sir Andrew?

Sir And. An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

Sir To. Here comes the little villain.

*Enter Maria.*

Mar. How now, my metal of India!

Mar. Get ye all three into the box-tree: Mal-
volio’s coming down this walk: he has been
yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own
shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love
of mockery; for I know this letter will make a
contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name
of jesting! Lie thou there *[throws down a letter]*;
for here comes the trout that must be caught
with tickling. *[Exit.]*

*Enter Malvolio.*

Mal. ’Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria
once told me she did affect me: and I have heard
herself come thus near, that, should she fancy, it
should be one of my complexion. Besides, she
uses me with a more exalted respect than any
one else that follows her. What should I think
on’t?

Sir To. Here’s an overweening rogue!

Fab. O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare
turkey-cock of him: how he jets under his ad-
vanced plumes!

Sir And. ’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

Sir To. Peace, I say.

Mal. To be Count Malvolio!

Sir To. Ah, rogue!

Sir And. Pistol him, pistol him.

Sir To. Peace, peace!

Mal. There is example for’t; the lady of the
Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.

Sir And. Fie on him, Jezebel!

Fab. O, peace! now he’s deeply in: look how
imagination blows him.

Mal. Having been three months married to
her, sitting in my state—

Sir To. O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the
eye!

Mal. Calling my officers about me, in my
branched velvet gown; having come from a day-
bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping—

Sir To. Fire and brimstone!

Fab. O, peace, peace!

Mal. And then to have the humour of state;
and after a demure travel of regard, telling them
I know my place as I would they should do theirs,
to ask for my kinsman Toby—

Sir To. Bolts and shackles!

Fab. O peace, peace, peace! now, now.

Mal. Seven of my people, with an obedient
start, make out for him: I frown the while; and
perchance wind up my watch, or play with my—
some rich jewel. Toby approaches; courtesies
there to me—

Sir To. Shall this fellow live?

Fab. Though our silence be drawn from us
with cords, yet peace.

Mal. I extend my hand to him thus, quench-
ing my familiar smile with an austere regard of
control—

Sir To. And does not Toby take you a blow
o’ the lips then?

Mal. Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes hav-
ing cast me on your niece give me this preroga-
tive of speech”—

Sir To. What, what?

Mal. “You must amend your drunkenness.”

Sir To. Out, scab!

Fab. Nay, patience, or we break the sinews
of our plot.

Mal. “Besides, you waste the treasure of your
time with a foolish knight”—

Sir And. That’s me, I warrant you.

Mal. “One Sir Andrew”—

Sir And. I knew ’twas I; for many do call me
fool.

Mal. What employment have we here?
*[Taking up the letter.]*

Fab. Now is the woodcock near the gin.

Sir To. O, peace! and the spirit of humours
intimate reading aloud to him!

Mal. By my life, this is my lady’s hand: these
be her very C’s, her I’s and her T’s; and thus
makes she her great T’s. It is, in contempt of
question, her hand.

Sir And. Her C’s, her I’s and her T’s: why
that?

Mal. *[Reads]* “To the unknown beloved, this,
and my good wishes”—her very phrases! By
your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her
*Lucrece*, with which she uses to seal: ’tis my
lady. To whom should this be?

Fab. This wins him, liver and all.

Mal. *[Reads]*
  “Jove knows I love:
  But who?
  Lips, do not move;
  No man must know.”
“No man must know.” What follows? the num-
bers altered! “No man must know.” If this
should be thee, Malvolio?

Sir To. Marry, hang thee, brock!

Mal. *[Reads]*
  “I may command where I adore;
  But silence, like a *Lucrece* knife,
  With bloodless stroke my heart doth
  gore:
  M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.”

Fab. A fustian riddle!

Sir To. Excellent wench, say I.

Mal. “M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.” Nay,
but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.

Fab. What dish o’ poison has she dressed him!

Sir To. And with what wing the staniel checks
at it!

Mal. “I may command where I adore.” Why,
she may command me: I serve her; she is my
lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capac-
ity; there is no obstruction in this: and the
end—what should that alphabetical position por-
tend? If I could make that resemble something
in me—Softly! M, O, A, I—

Sir To. O, ay, make up that: he is now at a
cold scent.

Fab. Souter will cry upon’t for all this, though
it be as rank as a fox.

Mal. M—Malvolio; M—why, that begins my
name.

Fab. Did not I say he would work it out? the
cur is excellent at faults.

Mal. M—but then there is no consonancy in
the sequel; that suffers under probation: A
should follow, but O does.

Fab. And O shall end, I hope.

Sir To. Ay, or I’ll cudgel him, and make him
cry O!

Mal. And then I comes behind.

Fab. Ay, an you had any eye behind you,
you might see more detraction at your heels than
fortunes before you.

Mal. M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the
former: and yet, to crush this a little, it would
bow to me, for every one of these letters are
in my name. Soft! here follows prose.

*[Reads]* “If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In
my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of
greatness: some are born great, some achieve
greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon
’em. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood
and spirit embrace them; and, to inure thyself to
what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough
and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman,
surly with servants; let thy tongue tang argu-
ments of state; put thyself into the trick of sin-
gularity: she thus advises thee that sighs for thee.
Remember who commended thy yellow stock-
ings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered:
I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou
desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee a stew-
ard still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy
to touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell. She that
would alter services with thee,
The Fortunate-Unhappy”
Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this
is open. I will be proud, I will read politic
authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off
gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the
very man. I do not now fool myself, to let ima-
gination jade me; for every reason excites to
this, that my lady loves me. She did commend
my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my
leg being cross-gartered; and in this she mani-
fests herself to my love, and with a kind of in-
junction drives me to these habits of her liking.
I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange,
stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered,
even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and
my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.
*[Reads]* “Thou canst not choose but know who I
am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear
in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well;
therefore in my presence still smile, dear my
sweet, I prithee.”

Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
everything that thou wilt have me. *[Exit.]*

Fab. I will not give my part of this sport for

a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.

Sir To. I could marry this wench for this device.
Sir And. So could I too.
Sir To. And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
Sir And. Nor I neither.
Fab. Here comes my noble gull-catcher.

Re-enter Maria.

Sir To. Wilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck?
Sir And. Or o’ mine either?
Sir To. Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave?
Sir And. I’ faith, or I either?
Sir To. Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.

# TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL

Mar. Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
Sir To. Like *aqua-vitae* with a midwife.
Mar. If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady: he will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me.
Sir To. To the gates of Tartarus, thou most excellent devil of wit!
Sir And. I’ll make one too.
* [Exeunt.]

## ACT III

### Scene i. Olivia's garden

*Enter Viola, and Clown with a tabor.*

Vio. Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by thy tabor?
Clo. No, sir, I live by the church.
Vio. Art thou a churchman?
Clo. No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
Vio. So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.
Clo. You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!
Vio. Nay, that’s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.
Clo. I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
Vio. Why, man?
Clo. Why, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
Vio. Thy reason, man?
Clo. Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.
Vio. I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Clo. Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Vio. Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?
Clo. No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings; the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.
Vio. I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.
Clo. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
Vio. Nay, an thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee.
Clo. Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
Vio. By my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one;
* [Aside] *though I would not have it grow on my chin.*
Is thy lady within?
Clo. Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
Vio. Yes, being kept together and put to use.
Clo. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.
Vio. I understand you, sir; ’tis well begged.
Clo. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will construe to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say “element,” but the word is over-worn.
* [Exit.]

Vio. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
And to do that well craves a kind of wit.
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
The quality of persons, and the time,
And, like the haggard, check at every feather
That comes before his eye. This is a practice
As full of labour as a wise man’s art:
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
But wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.

*Enter Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew.*

Sir To. Save you, gentleman.
Vio. And you, sir.
Sir And. *Dieu vous garde, monsieur.*
Vio. *Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.*
Sir And. I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
Sir To. Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
Vio. I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the list of my voyage.
Sir To. Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
Vio. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
Sir To. I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

# TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL

Vio. I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented.

*Enter Olivia and Maria.*

Vio. Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!
Sir And. That youth’s a rare courtier: “Rain odours”; well.
Vio. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
Sir And. “Odours,” “pregnant,” and “vouchsafed”; I’ll get ’em all three all ready.
Oli. Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
* [Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria.]
Give me your hand, sir.
Vio. My duty, madam, and most humble service.
Oli. What is your name?
Vio. Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.
Oli. My servant, sir! ’Twas never merry world
Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment:
You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
Vio. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.
Oli. For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
Would they were blanks, rather than fill’d with me!
Vio. Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
On his behalf.
Oli. O, by your leave, I pray you,
I bade you never speak again of him:
But, would you undertake another suit,
I had rather hear you to solicit that
Than music from the spheres.
Vio. Dear lady—
Oli. Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
After the last enchantment you did here,
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you:
Under your hard construction must I sit,
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
Have you not set mine honour at the stake
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
Enough is shown: a cyprus, not a bosom,
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
Vio. I pity you.
Oli. That’s a degree to love.
Vio. No, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof,
That very oft we pity enemies.
Oli. Why, then, methinks ’tis time to smile again.
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
If one should be a prey, how much the better
To fall before the lion than the wolf!
* [Clock strikes.]
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
Your wife is like to reap a proper man:
There lies your way, due west.
Vio. Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
Attend your ladyship!
You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
Oli. Stay:
I prithee, tell me what thou think’st of me.
Vio. That you do think you are not what you are.
Oli. If I think so, I think the same of you.
Vio. Then think you right: I am not what I am.
Oli. I would you were as I would have you be!
Vio. Would it be better, madam, than I am?
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
Oli. O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
In the contempt and anger of his lip!
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
Than love that would seem hid: love’s night is noon.
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.
Vio. By innocence I swear, and by my youth,
I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,
And that no woman has; nor never none
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
And so adieu, good madam: never more
Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.
Oli. Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
* [Exeunt.]

### Scene ii. Olivia's house

*Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.*

Sir And. No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.
Sir To. Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
Fab. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
Sir And. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count’s serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw ’t i’ the orchard.
Sir To. Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.
Sir And. As plain as I see you now.
Fab. This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
Sir And. ’Slight, will you make an ass o’ me?
Fab. I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgement and reason.
Sir To. And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
Fab. She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her; and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
Sir And. An’t be any way, it must be with valour; for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
Sir To. Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places; my niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour.
Fab. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
Sir And. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
Sir To. Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention: taunt him with the license of ink: if thou thou’st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down: go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.
Sir And. Where shall I find you?
Sir To. We’ll call thee at the *cubiculo*: go.
* [Exit Sir Andrew.]

Fab. This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
Sir To. I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.
Fab. We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver’t?
Sir To. Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of the anatomy.
Fab. And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.

*Enter Maria.*

Sir To. Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
Mar. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.
Sir To. And cross-gartered?
Mar. Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ the church. I have dogged him, like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies: You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do, he’ll smile and take’t for a great favour.
Sir To. Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
* [Exeunt.]

### Scene iii. A street

*Enter Sebastian and Antonio.*

Seb. I would not by my will have troubled you;
But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
I will no further chide you.
Ant. I could not stay behind you: my desire,
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
And not all love to see you, though so much
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
But jealousy what might befall your travel,
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
Unguided and unfriended, often prove
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
The rather by these arguments of fear,
Set forth in your pursuit.
Seb. My kind Antonio,
I can no other answer make but thanks,
And thanks; and ever thanks; and oft good turns
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
You should find better dealing. What’s to do?
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
Ant. To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
Seb. I am not weary, and ’tis long to night:
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city.
Ant. Would you’ld pardon me;
I do not without danger walk these streets:
Once, in a sea-fight, ’gainst the Count his galleys
I did some service; of such note indeed,
That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answer’d.
Seb. Belike you slew great number of his people.
Ant. The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Might well have given us bloody argument.
It might have since been answer’d in repaying
What we took from them; which, for traffic’s sake,
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
I shall pay dear.
Seb. Do not then walk too open.
Ant. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
Seb. Why I your purse?
Ant. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase; and your store,
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
Seb. I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you
For an hour.
Ant. To the Elephant.
Seb. I do remember.
* [Exeunt.]

### Scene iv. Olivia's garden

*Enter Olivia and Maria.*

Oli. I have sent after him: he says he’ll come;
How shall I feast him? what bestow on him?
For youth is bought more oft than begg’d or borrow’d.
I speak too loud.
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
Where is Malvolio?
Mar. He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is, sure, possessed, madam.
Oli. Why, what’s the matter? does he rave?
Mar. No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in’s wits.
Oli. Go call him hither.
* [Exit Maria.]
I am as mad as he,
If sad and merry madness equal be.

*Re-enter Maria, with Malvolio.*

Oli. How now, Malvolio!
Mal. Sweet lady, ho, ho.
Oli. Smilest thou?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
Mal. Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.”
Oli. Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
Mal. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
Oli. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
Mal. To bed! ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.
Oli. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft?
Mar. How do you, Malvolio?
Mal. At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
Mar. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
Mal. “Be not afraid of greatness”: ’twas well writ.
Oli. What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
Mal. “Some are born great”—
Oli. Ha!
Mal. “Some achieve greatness”—
Oli. What sayest thou?
Mal. “And some have greatness thrust upon them.”
Oli. Heaven restore thee!
Mal. “Remember who commended thy yellow stockings”—
Oli. Thy yellow stockings!
Mal. “And wished to see thee cross-gartered.”
Oli. Cross-gartered!
Mal. “Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so”—
Oli. Am I made?
Mal. “If not, let me see thee a servant still.”
Oli. Why, this is very midsummer madness.

*Enter Servant.*

Serv. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyship’s pleasure.
Oli. I’ll come to him.
* [Exit Servant.]
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.
* [Exeunt Olivia and Maria.]

Mal. O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. “Cast thy humble slough,” says she; “be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity”; and consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to”: “fellow!” not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, every thing adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

*Re-enter Maria, with Sir Toby and Fabian.*

Sir To. Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.
Fab. Here he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? how is’t with you, man?
Mal. Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go off.
Mar. Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.
Mal. Ah, ha! does she so?
Sir To. Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how is’t with you? What, man! defy the devil: consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.
Mal. Do you know what you say?
Mar. La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
Fab. Carry his water to the wise woman.
Mar. Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.
Mal. How now, mistress!
Mar. O Lord!
Sir To. Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
Fab. No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used.
Sir To. Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
Mal. Sir!
Sir To. Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! ’tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang him, foul collier!
Mar. Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
Mal. My prayers, minx!
Mar. No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
Mal. Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I am not of your element: you shall know more hereafter.
* [Exit.]

Sir To. Is’t possible?
Fab. If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
Sir To. His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
Mar. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
Fab. Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
Mar. The house will be the quieter.
Sir To. Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad: we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him: at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see.

*Enter Sir Andrew.*

Fab. More matter for a May morning.
Sir And. Here’s the challenge, read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in’t.
Fab. Is’t so saucy?
Sir And. Ay, is’t, I warrant him: do but read.
Sir To. Give me.
* [Reads]
“Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.”
Fab. Good, and valiant.
Sir To.
* [Reads]
“Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for’t.”
Fab. A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.

# TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL

Sir To.
* [Reads]
“Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.”
Fab. Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.
Sir To.
* [Reads]
“I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me”—
Fab. Good.
Sir To.
* [Reads]
“Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.”
Fab. Still you keep o’ the windy side of the law: good.
Sir To.
* [Reads]
“Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy. Andrew Aguecheek.”
Sir To. If this letter move him not, his legs cannot: I’ll give’t him.
Mar. You may have very fit occasion for’t. He is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
Sir To. Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-bailiff: so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and, as thou drawest, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away!
Sir And. Nay, let me alone for swearing.
* [Exit.]

Sir To. Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.

*Re-enter Olivia, with Viola.*

Fab. Here he comes with your niece: give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.
Sir To. I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.
* [Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian, and Maria.]

Oli. I have said too much unto a heart of stone
And laid mine honour too unchary out:
There’s something in me that reproves my fault;
But such a headstrong potent fault it is
That it but mocks reproof.
Vio. With the same ’haviour that your passion bears
Goes on my master’s grief.
Oli. Here, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture;
Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,
That honour saved may upon asking give?
Vio. Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
Oli. How with mine honour may I give him that
Which I have given to you?
Vio. I will acquit you.
Oli. Well, come again to-morrow. Fare thee well:
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
* [Exit.]

*Re-enter Sir Toby and Fabian.*

Sir To. Gentleman, God save thee.
Vio. And you, sir.
Sir To. That defence thou hast, betake thee to’t: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end: dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
Vio. You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.
Sir To. You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
Vio. I pray you, sir, what is he?
Sir To. He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl; souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give’t or take’t.
Vio. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk.
Sir To. Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury: therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with

which with as much safety you might answer
him: therefore, on, or strip your sword stark
naked; for meddle you must, that’s certain, or
forswear to wear iron about you.

Vio. This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech
you, do me this courteous office, as to know of
the knight what my offence to him is: it is some-
thing of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.

Sir To. I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you
by this gentleman till my return. *[Exit.]*

Vio. Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

Fab. I know the knight is incensed against you,
even to a mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the
circumstance more.

Vio. I beseech you, what manner of man is
he?

Fab. Nothing of that wonderful promise, to
read him by his form, as you are like to find him
in the proof of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the
most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you
could possibly have found in any part of Illyria.
Will you walk towards him? I will make your
peace with him if I can.

Vio. I shall be much bound to you for’t. I am
one that had rather go with sir priest than sir
knight. I care not who knows so much of my
mettle. *[Exeunt.]*

Re-enter Sir Toby, with Sir Andrew.

Sir To. Why, man, he’s a very devil; I have
not seen such a virago. I had a pass with him,
rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the
stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is in-
evitable; and on the answer, he pays you as
surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.

Sir And. Pox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.

Sir To. Ay, but he will not now be pacified:
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.

Sir And. Plague on’t, an I thought he had been
valiant and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen
him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let
him let the matter slip and I’ll give him my
horse, grey Capilet.

Sir To. I’ll make the motion: stand here, make
a good show on’t: this shall end without the
perdition of souls. *[Aside]* Marry, I’ll ride your
horse as well as I ride you.

Re-enter Fabian and Viola.

Sir To. *[To Fabian]* I have his horse to take up the quar-
rel: I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.

Fab. He is as horribly conceited of him; and
pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his
heels.

Sir To. *[To Viola]* There’s no remedy, sir; he
will fight with you for’s oath sake: marry, he
hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he
finds that now scarce to be worth talking of;
therefore draw, for the supportance of his vow;
he protests he will not hurt you.

Vio. *[Aside]* Pray God defend me! A little thing
would make me tell them how much I lack of a
man.

Fab. Give ground, if you see him furious.

Sir To. Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy;
the gentleman will, for his honour’s sake, have
one bout with you; he cannot by the *duello* avoid
it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman
and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on;
to’t.

Sir And. Pray God, he keep his oath!

Vio. I do assure you, ’tis against my will.

*[They draw.]*

Enter Antonio.

Ant. Put up your sword. If this young gentle-
man
Have done offence, I take the fault on me;
If you offend him, I for him defy you.

Sir To. You, sir! why, what are you?

Ant. One, sir, that for his love dares yet do
more
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.

Sir To. Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for
you.

*[They draw.]*

Enter Officers.

Fab. O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the
officers.

Sir To. I’ll be with you anon.

Vio. Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.

Sir And. Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I prom-
ised you, I’ll be as good as my word: he will bear
you easily and reins well.

First Off. This is the man; do thy office.

Second Off. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of
Count Orsino.

Ant. You do mistake me, sir.

First Off. No, sir, no jot; I know your favour
well,
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
Take him away: he knows I know him well.

Ant. I must obey. *[To Viola]* This comes with
seeking you.
But there’s no remedy; I shall answer it.
What will you do, now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
Much more for what I cannot do for you
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
But be of comfort.

Second Off. Come, sir, away.

Ant. I must entreat of you some of that money.

Vio. What money, sir?
For the fair kindness you have show’d me here,
And, part, being prompted by your present
trouble,
Out of my lean and low ability
I’ll lend you something: my having is not much;
I’ll make division of my present with you:
Hold, there’s half my coffer.

Ant. Will you deny me now?
Is’t possible that my deserts to you
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
Lest that it make me so unsound a man
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
That I have done for you.

Vio. I know of none;
Nor know I you by voice or any feature.
I hate ingratitude more in a man
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
Inhabits our frail blood.

Ant. O heavens themselves!

Second Off. Come, sir, I pray you, go.

Ant. Let me speak a little. This youth that you
see here
I snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death,
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
And to his image, which methought did promise
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.

First Off. What’s that to us? The time goes by:
away!

Ant. But O how vile an idol proves this god!
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
In nature there’s no blemish but the mind;
None can be call’d deform’d but the unkind:
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
Are empty trunks o’erflourish’d by the devil.

First Off. The man grows mad: away with him!
Come, come, sir.

Ant. Lead me on. *[Exit with Officers.]*

Vio. Methinks his words do from such passion
fly
That he believes himself: so do not I.
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!

Sir To. Come hither, knight; come hither, Fa-
bian: we’ll whisper o’er a couplet or two of most
sage saws.

Vio. He named Sebastian: I my brother know
Yet living in my glass; even such and so
In favour was my brother, and he went
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
For him I imitate. O, if it prove,
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.

*[Exit.]*

Sir To. A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a
coward than a hare: his dishonesty appears in
leaving his friend here in necessity and denying
him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.

Fab. A coward, a most devout coward, religious
in it.

Sir And. ’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.

Sir To. Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw
thy sword.

Sir And. An I do not— *[Exit.]*

Fab. Come, let’s see the event.

Sir To. I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing
yet. *[Exeunt.]*

## ACT IV
### Scene I. Before Olivia’s house

Enter Sebastian and Clown.

Clo. Will you make me believe that I am not
sent for you?

Seb. Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
Let me be clear of thee.

Clo. Well held out, i’ faith! No, I do not know
you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid
you come speak with her; nor your name is not
Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither.
Nothing that is so is so.

Seb. I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else:
Thou know’st not me.

Clo. Vent my folly! He has heard that word of
some great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent
my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

Seb. I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me:
There’s money for thee: if you tarry longer,
I shall give worse payment.

Clo. By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These
wise men that give fools money get themselves a
good report—after fourteen years’ purchase.

Enter Sir Andrew, Sir Toby, and Fabian.

Sir And. Now, sir, have I met you again?
there’s for you.

Seb. Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there.
Are all the people mad?

Sir To. Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er
the house.

Clo. This will I tell my lady straight: I would
not be in some of your coats for two pence. *[Exit.]*

Sir To. Come on, sir; hold.

Sir And. Nay, let him alone: I’ll go another way
to work with him; I’ll have an action of battery
against him, if there be any law in Illyria: though
I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.

Seb. Let go thy hand.

Sir To. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come,
my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well
fleshed; come on.

Seb. I will be free from thee. What wouldst
thou now?
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.

Sir To. What, what? Nay, then I must have an
ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.

Enter Olivia.

Oli. Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!

Sir To. Madam!

Oli. Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
Where manners ne’er were preach’d! out of my
sight!
Be not offended, dear Cesario.
Rudesby, begone!

*[Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.]*

I prithee, gentle friend,
Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
In this uncivil and unjust extent
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
This ruffian hath botch’d up, that thou thereby
Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.

Seb. What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

Oli. Nay, come, I prithee; would thou’ldst be
ruled by me!

Seb. Madam, I will.

Oli. O, say so, and so be! *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene II. Olivia’s house

Enter Maria and Clown.

Mar. Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this
beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the
curate: do it quickly; I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.

*[Exit.]*

Clo. Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble
myself in’t; and I would I were the first that ever
dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough
to become the function well, nor lean enough to
be thought a good student; but to be said an
honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly
as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The
competitors enter.

Enter Sir Toby and Maria.

Sir To. Jove bless thee, Master Parson.

Clo. *Bonos dies*, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit
of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very
wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, “That
that is is”; so I, being Master Parson, am Master
Parson; for, what is “that” but “that,” and “is”
but “is”?

Sir To. To him, Sir Topas.

Clo. What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

Sir To. The knave counterfeits well; a good
knave.

Mal. *[Within]* Who calls there?

Clo. Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit
Malvolio the lunatic.

Mal. Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go
to my lady.

Clo. Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou
this man! talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

Sir To. Well said, Master Parson.

Mal. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged:
good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad: they have
laid me here in hideous darkness.

Clo. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the
most modest terms; for I am one of those gentle
ones that will use the devil himself with cour-
tesy: sayest thou that house is dark?

Mal. As hell, Sir Topas.

Clo. Why, it hath bay windows transparent as
barricadoes, and the clear-stories toward the
south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet
complainest thou of obstruction?

Mal. I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you,
this house is dark.

Clo. Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no
darkness but ignorance; in which thou art more
puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.

Mal. I say, this house is as dark as ignorance,
though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say,
there was never man thus abused. I am no more
mad than you are: make the trial of it in any
constant question.

Clo. What is the opinion of Pythagoras con-
cerning wild fowl?

Mal. That the soul of our grandam might haply
inhabit a bird.

Clo. What thinkest thou of his opinion?

Mal. I think nobly of the soul, and no way
approve his opinion.

Clo. Fare thee well. Remain thou still in dark-
ness: thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras
ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a
woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy
grandam. Fare thee well.

Mal. Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

Sir To. My most exquisite Sir Topas!

Clo. Nay, I am for all waters.

Mar. Thou mightst have done this without thy
beard and gown: he sees thee not.

Sir To. To him in thine own voice, and bring
me word how thou findest him: I would we were
well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveni-
ently delivered, I would he were, for I am now
so far in offence with my niece that I cannot
pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.
Come by and by to my chamber.

*[Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria.]*

Clo. *[Singing]* “Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
Tell me how thy lady does.”

Mal. Fool!

Clo. “My lady is unkind, perdy.”

Mal. Fool!

Clo. “Alas, why is she so?”

Mal. Fool, I say!

Clo. “She loves another”—Who calls, ha?

Mal. Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well
at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink
and paper: as I am a gentleman, I will live to be
thankful to thee for’t.

Clo. Master Malvolio?

Mal. Ay, good fool.

Clo. Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five
wits?

Mal. Fool, there was never man so notoriously
abused: I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

Clo. But as well? then you are mad indeed, if
you be no better in your wits than a fool.

Mal. They have here propertied me; keep me
in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do
all they can to face me out of my wits.

Clo. Advise you what you say; the minister is
here. Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens
restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy
vain bibble babble.

Mal. Sir Topas!

Clo. Maintain no words with him, good fellow.
Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi’ you, good Sir
Topas. Marry, amen. I will, sir, I will.

Mal. Fool, fool, fool, I say!

Clo. Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I
am shent for speaking to you.

Mal. Good fool, help me to some light and some
paper: I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any
man in Illyria.

Clo. Well-a-day that you were, sir!

Mal. By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink,
paper, and light; and convey what I will set down
to my lady: it shall advantage thee more than
ever the bearing of letter did.

Clo. I will help you to’t. But tell me true, are
you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?

Mal. Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

Clo. Nay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see
his brains. I will fetch you light and paper and
ink.

Mal. Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree:
I prithee, be gone.

Clo. *[Singing]* “I am gone, sir,
And anon, sir,
I’ll be with you again,
In a trice,
Like to the old Vice,
Your need to sustain;
Who, with dagger of lath,
In his rage and his wrath,
Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
Like a mad lad,
Pare thy nails, dad;
Adieu, good man devil.”

*[Exit.]*

### Scene III. Olivia’s garden

Enter Sebastian.

Seb. This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
This pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see’t;
And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?
I could not find him at the Elephant:
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
That he did range the town to seek me out.
His counsel now might do me golden service;
For though my soul disputes well with my sense
That this may be some error, but no madness,
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad
Or else the lady’s mad; yet, if ’twere so,
She could not sway her house, command her
followers,
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
As I perceive she does: there’s something in’t
That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.

Enter Olivia and Priest.

Oli. Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean
well,
Now go with me and with this holy man
Into the chantry by: there, before him,
And underneath that consecrated roof,
Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
May live at peace. He shall conceal it
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
What time we will our celebration keep
According to my birth. What do you say?

Seb. I’ll follow this good man and go with
you;
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

Oli. Then lead the way, good father; and
heavens so shine,
That they may fairly note this act of mine!

*[Exeunt.]*

## ACT V
### Scene I. Before Olivia’s house

Enter Clown and Fabian.

Fab. Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his
letter.

Clo. Good Master Fabian, grant me another re-
quest.

Fab. Anything.

Clo. Do not desire to see this letter.

Fab. This is, to give a dog, and in recompense
desire my dog again.

Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and Lords.

Duke. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

Clo. Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.

Duke. I know thee well: how dost thou, my
good fellow?

Clo. Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the
worse for my friends.

Duke. Just the contrary; the better for thy
friends.

Clo. No, sir, the worse.

Duke. How can that be?

Clo. Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass
of me; now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass:
so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge
of myself, and by my friends I am abused: so
that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four
negatives make your two affirmatives, why then,
the worse for my friends and the better for my
foes.

Duke. Why, this is excellent.

Clo. By my troth, sir, no; though it please you
to be one of my friends.

Duke. Thou shalt not be the worse for me:
there’s gold.

Clo. But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I
would you could make it another.

Duke. O, you give me ill counsel.

Clo. Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this
once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.

Duke. Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
double-dealer: there’s another.

Clo. *Primo, secundo, tertio*, is a good play; and
the old saying is, the third pays for all: the
*triplex*, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the
bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind;
one, two, three.

Duke. You can fool no more money out of me
at this throw: if you will let your lady know I am
here to speak with her, and bring her along with
you, it may awake my bounty further.

Clo. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I
come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you
to think that my desire of having is the sin of
covetousness: but, as you say, sir, let your bounty
take a nap, I will awake it anon. *[Exit.]*

Vio. Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue
me.

Enter Antonio and Officers.

Duke. That face of his I do remember well;
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear’d
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,
With which such scathful grapple did he make
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
That very envy and the tongue of loss
Cried fame and honour on him. What’s the
matter?

First Off. Orsino, this is that Antonio
That took the *Phoenix* and her fraught from
Candy;
And this is he that did the *Tiger* board,
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
In private brabble did we apprehend him.

Vio. He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
I know not what ’twas but distraction.

Duke. Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mer-
cies,
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
Hast made thine enemies?

Ant. Orsino, noble sir,
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give
me:
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love, without retention or restraint,
All his in dedication; for his sake
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
Into the danger of this adverse town;
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink; denied me mine own
purse,
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before.

Vio. How can this be?

Duke. When came he to this town?

Ant. To-day, my lord; and for three months
before,
No interim, not a minute’s vacancy,
Both day and night did we keep company.

Enter Olivia and Attendants.

Duke. Here comes the Countess: now heaven
walks on earth.
But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are mad-
ness:
Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
But more of that anon. Take him aside.

Oli. What would my lord, but that he may not
have,
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

Vio. Madam!

Duke. Gracious Olivia—

Oli. What do you say, Cesario? Good my
lord—

Vio. My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

Oli. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music.

Duke. Still so cruel?

Oli. Still so constant, lord.

Duke. What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
My soul the faithfull’st offerings hath breathed
out
That e’er devotion tender’d! What shall I do?

Oli. Even what it please my lord, that shall be-
come him.

Duke. Why should I not, had I the heart to do
it,
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
Kill what I love?—a savage jealousy
That sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
And that I partly know the instrument
That screws me from my true place in your
favour,
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
But this your minion, whom I know you love,
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite.
Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in
mischief:
I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.

Vio. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,
To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

Oli. Where goes Cesario?

Vio. After him I love
More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
More, by all mores, than e’er I shall love wife.
If I do feign, you witnesses above
Punish my life for tainting of my love!

Oli. Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!

Vio. Who does beguile you? who does do you
wrong?

Oli. Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Call forth the holy father.

Duke. Come, away!

Oli. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.

Duke. Husband!

Oli. Ay, husband: can he that deny?

Duke. Her husband, sirrah!

Vio. No, my lord, not I.

Oli. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art
As great as that thou fear’st.

Enter Priest.

O, welcome, father!
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
Here to unfold, though lately we intended
To keep in darkness what occasion now
Reveals before ’tis ripe, what thou dost know
Hath newly pass’d between this youth and me.

Priest. A contract of eternal bond of love,
Confirm’d by mutual joinder of your hands,
Attested by the holy close of lips,
Strengthen’d by interchangement of your rings;
And all the ceremony of this compact
Seal’d in my function, by my testimony:
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my
grave
I have travell’d but two hours.

Duke. O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou
be
When time hath sow’d a grizzle on thy case?
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.

Vio. My lord, I do protest—

Oli. O, do not swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much
fear.

# ACT V

## TWELFTH NIGHT; OR, WHAT YOU WILL

*Enter Sir Andrew.*

**Sir And.** For the love of God, a surgeon! Send
one presently to Sir Toby.

**Oli.** What’s the matter?

**Sir And.** He has broke my head across and has
given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too: for the
love of God, your help! I had rather than forty
pound I were at home.

**Oli.** Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

**Sir And.** The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario:
we took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil
incarnate.

**Duke.** My gentleman, Cesario?

**Sir And.** ’Od’s lifelings, here he is! You broke
my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was
set on to do’t by Sir Toby.

**Vio.** Why do you speak to me? I never hurt
you:
You drew your sword upon me without cause;
But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not.

**Sir And.** If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you
have hurt me: I think you set nothing by a bloody
coxcomb.

*Enter Sir Toby and Clown.*

Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear
more: but if he had not been in drink, he would
have tickled you othergates than he did.

**Duke.** How now, gentleman! how is’t with
you?

**Sir To.** That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s
the end on’t. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?

**Clo.** O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone;
his eyes were set at eight i’ the morning.

**Sir To.** Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures
pavin: I hate a drunken rogue.

**Oli.** Away with him! Who hath made this havoc
with them?

**Sir And.** I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll
be dressed together.

**Sir To.** Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb
and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!

**Oli.** Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look’d
to.
*Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew.*

*Enter Sebastian.*

**Seb.** I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;
But, had it been the brother of my blood,
I must have done no less with wit and safety.
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
I do perceive it hath offended you:
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago.

**Duke.** One face, one voice, one habit, and two
persons,
A natural perspective, that is and is not!

**Seb.** Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
How have the hours rack’d and tortured me,
Since I have lost thee!

**Ant.** Sebastian are you?

**Seb.** Fear’st thou that, Antonio?

**Ant.** How have you made division of yourself?
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

**Oli.** Most wonderful!

**Seb.** Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
Of here and everywhere. I had a sister,
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour’d.
Of charity, what kin are you to me?
What countryman? what name? what parentage?

**Vio.** Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
So went he suited to his watery tomb.
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us.

**Seb.** A spirit I am indeed;
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate.
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
And say “Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!”

**Vio.** My father had a mole upon his brow.

**Seb.** And so had mine.

**Vio.** And died that day when Viola from her
birth
Had number’d thirteen years.

**Seb.** O, that record is lively in my soul!
He finished indeed his mortal act
That day that made my sister thirteen years.

**Vio.** If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurp’d attire,
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
That I am Viola: which to confirm,
I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle
help
I was preserved to serve this noble count.
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord.

**Seb.** *[To Olivia]* So comes it, lady, you have
been mistook:
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid;
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
You are betroth’d both to a maid and man.

**Duke.** Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
*[To Viola]* Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand
times
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

**Vio.** And all those sayings will I over-swear;
And all those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night.

**Duke.** Give me thy hand;
And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.

**Vio.** The captain that did bring me first on
shore
Hath my maid’s garments: he upon some action
Is now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,
A gentleman, and follower of my lady’s.

**Oli.** He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio
hither:
And yet, alas, now I remember me,
They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.

*Re-enter Clown with a letter, and Fabian.*

A most extracting frenzy of mine own
From my remembrance clearly banish’d his.
How does he, sirrah?

**Clo.** Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the
stave’s end as well as a man in his case may do:
has here writ a letter to you; I should have given
’t you to-day morning, but as a madman’s epis¬
tles are no gospels, so it skills not much when
they are delivered.

**Oli.** Open ’t, and read it.

**Clo.** Look then to be well edified when the fool
delivers the madman. *[Reads]* “By the Lord, ma¬
dam”—

**Oli.** How now! art thou mad?

**Clo.** No, madam, I do but read madness: an
your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you
must allow *Vox*.

**Oli.** Prithee, read i’ thy right wits.

**Clo.** So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits
is to read thus: therefore perpend, my princess,
and give ear.

**Oli.** Read it you, sirrah. *[To Fabian.]*

**Fab.** *[Reads]* “By the Lord, madam, you wrong
me, and the world shall know it: though you
have put me into darkness and given your drunk¬
en cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of
my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your
own letter that induced me to the semblance I
put on; with the which I doubt not but to do my¬
self much right, or you much shame. Think of me
as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought
of and speak out of my injury.
The madly-used Malvolio.”

**Oli.** Did he write this?

**Clo.** Ay, madam.

**Duke.** This savours not much of distraction.

**Oli.** See him deliver’d, Fabian; bring him hither.
*Exit Fabian.*
My lord, so please you, these things further
thought on,
To think me as well a sister as a wife,
One day shall crown the alliance on’t, so please
you,
Here at my house and at my proper cost.

**Duke.** Madam, I am most apt to embrace your
offer.
*[To Viola]* Your master quits you; and for your
service done him,
So much against the mettle of your sex,
So far beneath your soft and tender breed¬
ing,
And since you call’d me master for so long,
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
Your master’s mistress.

**Oli.** A sister! you are she.

*Re-enter Fabian, with Malvolio.*

**Duke.** Is this the madman?

**Oli.** Ay, my lord, this same.
How now, Malvolio!

**Mal.** Madam, you have done me wrong,
Notorious wrong.

**Oli.** Have I, Malvolio? no.

**Mal.** Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that
letter.
You must not now deny it is your hand:
Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention:
You can say none of this: well, grant it then
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
Why you have given me such clear lights of
favour,
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to
you,
To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
And, acting this in an obedient hope,
Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
And made the most notorious geek and gull
That e’er invention play’d on? tell me why.

**Oli.** Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
Though, I confess, much like the character:
But out of question ’tis Maria’s hand.
And now I do bethink me, it was she
First told me thou wast mad; then earnest in
my smiling,
And in such forms which here were presup¬
posed
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
This practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon
thee;
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Of thine own cause.

**Fab.** Good madam, hear me speak,
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Taint the condition of this present hour,
Which I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
Set this device against Malvolio here,
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
The letter at Sir Toby’s great importunity;
In recompense whereof he hath married her.
How with a sportful malice it was follow’d,
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
If that the injuries be justly weigh’d
That have on both sides pass’d.

**Oli.** Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

**Clo.** Why, “some are born great, some achieve
greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon
them.” I was one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir
Topas, sir; but that’s all one. “By the Lord, fool,
I am not mad.” But do you remember? “Madam,
why laugh you at such a barren rascal? an you
smile not, he’s gagged”; and thus the whirligig
of time brings in his revenges.

**Mal.** I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
*Exit.*

**Oli.** He hath been most notoriously abused.

**Duke.** Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace:
He hath not told us of the captain yet:
When that is known and golden time convents,
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
For so you shall be, while you are a man;
But when in other habits you are seen,
Orsino’s mistress and his fancy’s queen.
*Exeunt all, except Clown.*

**Clo.** *[Sings]*
“When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came to man’s estate,
With hey, ho, &c.
’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their
gate,
For the rain, &c.

But when I came, alas! to wive,
With hey, ho, &c.
By swaggering could I never thrive,
For the rain, &c.

But when I came unto my beds,
With hey, ho, &c.
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
For the rain, &c.

A great while ago the world begun,
With hey, ho, &c.
But that’s all one, our play is done,
And we’ll strive to please you every day.”
*Exit.*

## ACT I

### Scene i. Elsinore: a platform before the castle

*Francisco at his post. Enter to him Bernardo.*

**Ber.** Who’s there?

**Fran.** Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

**Ber.** Long live the king!

**Fran.** Bernardo?

**Ber.** He.

**Fran.** You come most carefully upon your hour.

**Ber.** ’Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,
Francisco.

**Fran.** For this relief much thanks: ’tis bitter
cold,
And I am sick at heart.

**Ber.** Have you had quiet guard?

**Fran.** Not a mouse stirring.

**Ber.** Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

**Fran.** I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who’s
there?

*Enter Horatio and Marcellus.*

**Hor.** Friends to this ground.

**Mar.** And liegemen to the Dane.

**Fran.** Give you good night.

**Mar.** O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

**Fran.** Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
*Exit.*

**Mar.** Holla! Bernardo!

**Ber.** Say,
What, is Horatio there?

**Hor.** A piece of him.

**Ber.** Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Mar¬
cellus.

**Mar.** What, has this thing appear’d again to¬
night?

**Ber.** I have seen nothing.

**Mar.** Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

**Hor.** Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.

**Ber.** Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we have two nights seen.

**Hor.** Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

**Ber.** Last night of all,
When yond same star that’s westward from the
pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one—

*Enter Ghost.*

**Mar.** Peace, break thee off; look, where it
comes again!

**Ber.** In the same figure, like the King that’s
dead.

**Mar.** Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

**Ber.** Looks it not like the King? mark it,
Horatio.

**Hor.** Most like: it harrows me with fear and
wonder.

**Ber.** It would be spoke to.

**Mar.** Question it, Horatio.

**Hor.** What art thou that usurp’st this time of
night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee,
speak!

**Mar.** It is offended.

**Ber.** See, it stalks away!

**Hor.** Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
*Exit Ghost.*

**Mar.** ’Tis gone, and will not answer.

**Ber.** How now, Horatio! you tremble and look
pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on’t?

**Hor.** Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

**Mar.** Is it not like the King?

**Hor.** As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
’Tis strange.

**Mar.** Thus twice before, and jump at this dead
hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

**Hor.** In what particular thought to work I know
not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

**Mar.** Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that
knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore
task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is’t that can inform me?

**Hor.** That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear’d to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Ham¬
let—
For so this side of our known world esteem’d
him—
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d com¬
pact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return’d
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same coven¬
ant,
And carriage of the article design’d,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other—
As it doth well appear unto our state—
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

**Ber.** I think it be no other but e’en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the
King
That was and is the question of these wars.

**Hor.** A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted
dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire
stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

*Re-enter Ghost.*

I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in
death,
Speak of it: *[Cock crows.]* stay, and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus.

**Mar.** Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

**Hor.** Do, if it will not stand.

**Ber.** ’Tis here!

**Hor.** ’Tis here!

**Mar.** ’Tis gone!
*Exit Ghost.*
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

**Ber.** It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

**Hor.** And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.

**Mar.** It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.

**Hor.** So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

**Mar.** Let’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning
know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
*Exeunt.*

### Scene ii. A room of state in the castle

*Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants.*

**King.** Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s
death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole king¬
dom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy—
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole—
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr’d
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras—
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew’s purpose—to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists, and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

**Cor. and Vol.** In that and all things will we show our
duty.

**King.** We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
*Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.*
And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is’t, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg,
Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

**Laer.** My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Den¬
mark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward
France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

**King.** Have you your father’s leave? What
says Polonius?

**Pol.** He hath, my lord, wrung from me my
slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

**King.** Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be
thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—

**Ham.** *[Aside]* A little more than kin, and less
than kind.

**King.** How is it that the clouds still hang on
you?

**Ham.** Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the
sun.

**Queen.** Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailèd lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must
die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

**Ham.** Ay, madam, it is common.

**Queen.** If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?

**Ham.** Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not
“seems.”
’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected ’haviour of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

**King.** ’Tis sweet and commendable in your
nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool’d:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd; whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to
earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

**Queen.** Let not thy mother lose her prayers,
Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Witten¬
berg.

**Ham.** I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

**King.** Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the King’s rouse the heavens shall bruit
again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
*Exeunt all but Hamlet.*

**Ham.** O, that this too too solid flesh would
melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d
His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in
nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month—
Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is
woman!—
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow’d my poor father’s body,
Like Niobe, all tears: why she, even she—
O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn’d longer—married with my
uncle,
My father’s brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

*Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.*

**Hor.** Hail to your lordship!

**Ham.** I am glad to see you well:
Horatio—or I do forget myself.

**Hor.** The same, my lord, and your poor servant
ever.

**Ham.** Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that
name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Marcellus?

**Mar.** My good lord—

**Ham.** I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

**Hor.** A truant disposition, good my lord.

**Ham.** I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,

# Hamlet

To make it truer of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

Hor. My lord, I came to see your father’s
funeral.

Ham. I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.

Hor. Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.

Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked
meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!—methinks I see my father.

Hor. Where, my lord?

Ham. In my mind’s eye, Horatio.

Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.

Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

Ham. Saw? who?

Hor. My lord, the King your father.

Ham. The King my father!

Hor. Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.

Ham. For God’s love, let me hear.

Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d
By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.

Ham. But where was this?

Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we
watch’d.

Ham. Did you not speak to it?

Hor. My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish’d from our sight.

Ham. ’Tis very strange.

Hor. As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.

Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?

All. We do, my lord.

Ham. Arm’d, say you?

All. Arm’d, my lord.

Ham. From top to toe?

All. My lord, from head to foot.

Ham. Then saw you not his face?

Hor. O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

Ham. What, look’d he frowningly?

Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in
anger.

Ham. Pale or red?

Hor. Nay, very pale.

Ham. And fix’d his eyes upon you?

Hor. Most constantly.

Ham. I would I had been there.

Hor. It would have much amazed you.

Ham. Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?

Hor. While one with moderate haste might
tell a hundred.

Mar. Longer, longer.

Hor. Not when I saw’t.

Ham. His beard was grizzled, no?

Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver’d.

Ham. I will watch to-night;
Perchance ’twill walk again.

Hor. I warrant it will.

Ham. If it assume my noble father’s person,
I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,
I’ll visit you.

All. Our duty to your honour.

Ham. Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
My father’s spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were
come!
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s
eyes.
[Exit.]

### Scene III. A room in Polonius’ house

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

Laer. My necessaries are embark’d: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.

Oph. Do you doubt that?

Laer. For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
No more.

Oph. No more but so?

Laer. Think it no more:
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves
you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster’d importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

Oph. I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff’d and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.

Laer. O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.

Enter Polonius.

A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

Pol. Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for
shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with
thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgement.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Pol. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my
lord.

Pol. The time invites you; go; your servants
tend.

Laer. Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.

Oph. ’Tis in my memory lock’d,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

Laer. Farewell.
[Exit.]

Pol. What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

Oph. So please you, something touching the
Lord Hamlet.

Pol. Marry, well bethought:
’Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so ’tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.

Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many
tenders
Of his affection to me.

Pol. Affection! pooh! you speak like a green
girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should
think.

Pol. Marry, I’ll teach you: think yourself a
baby;
That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more
dearly;
Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.

Oph. My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.

Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

Oph. And hath given countenance to his
speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so squander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to’t, I charge you: come your ways.

Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene IV. The platform

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.

Ham. What hour now?

Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.

Mar. No, it is struck.

Hor. Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near
the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off,
within.]
What does this mean, my lord?

Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes
his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring
reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.

Hor. Is it a custom?

Ham. Ay, marry, is’t:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour’d in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax’d of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform’d at
height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth—wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin—
By the o’ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o’er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star—
Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo—
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.

Hor. Look, my lords, it comes!

Enter Ghost.

Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from
hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we
do?
[Ghost beckons Hamlet.]

Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.

Mar. Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.

Hor. No, by no means.

Ham. It will not speak; then I will follow it.

Hor. Do not, my lord.

Ham. Why what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin’s fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I’ll follow it.

Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood,
my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o’er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.

Ham. It waves me still.
Go on; I’ll follow thee.

Mar. You shall not go, my lord.

Ham. Hold off your hands.

Hor. Be ruled; you shall not go.

Ham. My fate cries out.
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.
Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I’ll follow thee.
[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]

Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.

Mar. Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.

Hor. Have after. To what issue will this come?

Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

Hor. Heaven will direct it.

Mar. Nay, let’s follow him.
[Exeunt.]

### Scene V. Another part of the platform

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I’ll
go no further.

Ghost. Mark me.

Ham. I will.

Ghost. My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.

Ham. Alas, poor ghost!

Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.

Ham. Speak; I am bound to hear.

Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt
hear.

Ham. What?

Ghost. I am thy father’s spirit,
Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young
blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their
spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand an end,
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—

Ham. O God!

Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural
murder.

Ham. Murder!

Ghost. Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

Ham. Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings
as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.

Ghost. I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet,
hear:
’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father’s life
Now wears his crown.

Ham. O my prophetic soul!
My uncle!

Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate
beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark’d about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel’d, disappointed, unaneled,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head.
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
[Exit.]

Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! what
else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my
heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark:
[Writing.]
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is “Adieu, adieu! remember me.”
I have sworn’t.

Hor. [Within] My lord, my lord—

Mar. [Within] Lord Hamlet—

Hor. [Within] Heaven secure him!

Ham. So be it!

Hor. [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

Mar. How is’t, my noble lord?

Hor. What news, my lord?

Ham. O, wonderful!

Hor. Good my lord, tell it.

Ham. No; you’ll reveal it.

Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven.

Mar. Nor I, my lord.

Ham. How say you, then; would heart of man
once think it?
But you’ll be secret?

Hor. Ay, by heaven, my lord.

Ham. There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all
Denmark
But he’s an arrant knave.

Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from
the grave
To tell us this.

Ham. Why, right; you are i’ the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I’ll go pray.

Hor. These are but wild and whirling words,
my lord.

Ham. I’m sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, ’faith, heartily.

Hor. There’s no offence, my lord.

Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is,
Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you,
For your desire to know what is between us,
O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.

Hor. What is’t, my lord? we will.

Ham. Never make known what you have seen
to-night.

Hor. My lord, not I.

Mar. Nor I, my lord, in faith.

Ham. Nay, but swear’t.
Upon my sword.

Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.

Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

Ghost. [Beneath] Swear.

Ham. Ah, ha, boy! say’st thou so? art thou
there, truepenny?
Come on—you hear this fellow in the cellarage—
Consent to swear.

Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.

Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.

Ghost. [Beneath] Swear.

Ham. *Hic et ubique*? then we’ll shift our ground.
Come higher, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.

Ghost. [Beneath] Swear.

Ham. Well said, old mole! canst work i’ the
earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good
friends.

Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous
strange!

Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it wel-
come.
There are more things in heaven and earth,
Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could, an if
we would,”
Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be, an if
they might,”
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
Swear.

Ghost. [Beneath] Swear.

Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
[They swear.]
So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in to-
gether;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let’s go together.
[Exeunt.]

## ACT II

### Scene I. A room in Polonius’ house

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

Pol. Give him this money and these notes,
Reynaldo.

Rey. I will, my lord.

Pol. You shall do marvellous wisely, good
Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behaviour.

Rey. My lord, I did intend it.

Pol. Marry, well said; very well said. Look
you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they
keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more
nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of
him;
As thus, “I know his father and his friends,
And in part him”: do you mark this, Reynaldo?

Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.

Pol. “And in part him; but” you may say
“not well:
But, if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;
Addicted so and so”: and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.

Rey. As gaming, my lord.

Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.

Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.

Pol. ’Faith, no; as you may season it in the
charge.
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so
quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.

Rey. But, my good lord—

Pol. Wherefore should you do this?

Rey. Ay, my lord,
I would know that.

Pol. Marry, sir, here’s my drift;
And, I believe, it is a fetch of wit.
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ the working,
Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominated crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
“Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.

Rey. Very good, my lord.

Pol. And then, sir, does he this—he does—
what was I about to say? By the mass, I was
about to say something. Where did I leave?

Rey. At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend
or so,” and “gentleman.”

Pol. At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry;
He closes thus: “I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t’other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you
say,
There was a’ gaming; there o’ertook in’s rouse;
There falling out at tennis”: or perchance,
“I saw him enter such a house of sale,”
*Videlicet*, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out.
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

Rey. My lord, I have.

Pol. God be wi’ you; fare you well.

Rey. Good my lord!

Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.

Rey. I shall, my lord.

Pol. And let him ply his music.

Rey. Well, my lord.

Pol. Farewell!
[Exit Reynaldo.]

Enter Ophelia.

How now, Ophelia! what’s the matter?

Oph. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so af-
frighted!

Pol. With what, i’ the name of God?

Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul’d,
Ungarter’d, and down-gyved to his ankle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors—he comes before me.

Pol. Mad for thy love?

Oph. My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.

Pol. What said he?

Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,

He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being. That done, he lets me go;
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o'doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bent their light on me.

Pol. Come, go with me: I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?

Oph. No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me.

Pol. That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

*Exeunt.*

## Scene II. A room in the castle

*Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.*

King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbor'd to his youth and humor,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time; so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.

Ros. Both your Majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.

Guil. But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.

King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him!

Queen. Ay, amen!

*Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants.*

*Enter Polonius.*

Pol. The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully return'd.

King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.

Pol. Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath us'd to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

King. O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

Pol. Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

*Exit Polonius.*

He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.

Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

King. Well, we shall sift him.

*Re-enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.*

Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?

Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your Highness: whereat grieved,
That so to his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your Majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,

*Giving a paper.*

That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.

King. It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor.
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home!

*Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.*

Pol. This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad.
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.

Queen. More matter, with less art.

Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then; and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause.
Thus it remains and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter — have while she is mine —
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.

*Reads.*

"To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia"—
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; "beautified" is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:

*Reads.*

"In her excellent white bosom, these, etc."

Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?

Pol. Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.

*Reads.*

"Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.

"O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I
have not art to reckon my groans; but that I love
thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.

"Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this
machine is to him, Hamlet"

This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
All given to mine ear.

King. But how hath she
Received his love?

Pol. What do you think of me?

King. As of a man faithful and honorable.

Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you
think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing —
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me — what might you,
Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be": and then I prescripts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed — a short tale to make —
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.

King. Do you think 'tis this?

Queen. It may be, very likely.

Pol. Hath there been such a time — I'd fain
know that —
That I have positively said "'Tis so,"
When it proved otherwise?

King. Not that I know.

Pol. *[Pointing to his head and shoulder.]* Take
this from this, if this be otherwise:
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the center.

King. How may we try it further?

Pol. You know, sometimes he walks four hours
together
Here in the lobby.

Queen. So he does indeed.

Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter. If he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.

King. We will try it.

Queen. But, look, where sadly the poor wretch
comes reading.

Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.

*Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.*

*Enter Hamlet, reading.*

O, give me leave,
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.

Pol. Do you know me, my lord?

Ham. Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.

Pol. Not I, my lord.

Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.

Pol. Honest, my lord!

Ham. Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.

Pol. That's very true, my lord.

Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead
dog, being a god kissing carrion — Have you a
daughter?

Pol. I have, my lord.

Ham. Let her not walk i' the sun. Conception
is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to't.

Pol. *[Aside.]* How say you by that? Still harping
on my daughter: yet he knew me not at
first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone,
far gone, and truly in my youth I suffered much
extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to
him again. What do you read, my lord?

Ham. Words, words, words.

Pol. What is the matter, my lord?

Ham. Between who?

Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue
says here that old men have gray beards, that
their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick
amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak
hams; all which, sir, though I most powerfully
and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to
have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be
old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.

Pol. *[Aside.]* Though this be madness, yet there
is method in't. Will you walk out of the air, my
lord?

Ham. Into my grave.

Pol. Indeed, that is out o' the air. *[Aside.]* How
pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and
sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means
of meeting between him and my daughter. — My
honorable lord, I will most humbly take my
leave of you.

Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me any thing
that I will more willingly part withal: except my
life, except my life, except my life.

Pol. Fare you well, my lord.

Ham. These tedious old fools!

*Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.*

Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he
is.

Ros. *[To Polonius.]* God save you, sir!

*Exit Polonius.*

Guil. My honored lord!

Ros. My most dear lord!

Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost
thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads,
how do ye both?

Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.

Guil. Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?

Ros. Neither, my lord.

Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the
middle of her favors?

Guil. 'Faith, her privates we.

Ham. In the secret parts of fortune? O, most
true; she is a strumpet. What's the news?

Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown
honest.

Ham. Then is doomsday near. But your news
is not true. Let me question more in particular.
What have you, my good friends, deserved at the
hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison
hither?

Guil. Prison, my lord!

Ham. Denmark's a prison.

Ros. Then is the world one.

Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many
confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being
one o' the worst.

Ros. We think not so, my lord.

Ham. Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is
nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes
it so. To me it is a prison.

Ros. Why then, your ambition makes it one;
'tis too narrow for your mind.

Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell
and count myself a king of infinite space, were it
not that I have bad dreams.

Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition, for
the very substance of the ambitious is merely the
shadow of a dream.

Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.

Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and
light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.

Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our
monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars'
shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay,
I cannot reason.

Guil. We wait upon you.

Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with
the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like
an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended.
But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make
you at Elsinore?

Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in
thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends,
my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you
not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come,
come; nay, speak.

Guil. What should we say, my lord?

Ham. Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You
were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in
your looks which your modesties have not craft
enough to color. I know the good king and
queen have sent for you.

Ros. To what end, my lord?

Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure
you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the
consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our
ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal, be even
and direct with me, whether you were sent for,
or no?

Ros. *[Aside to Guildenstern.]* What say you?

Ham. *[Aside.]* Nay, then, I have an eye of you.
— If you love me, hold not off.

Guil. My lord, we were sent for.

Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to
the king and queen moult no feather. I have of
late — but wherefore I know not — lost all my
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed
it goes so heavily with my disposition that
this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile
promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air,
look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it
appears no other thing to me than a foul and
pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece
of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite
in faculty! in form and moving how express
and admirable! in action how like an angel! in
apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights
not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your
smiling you seem to say so.

Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my
thoughts.

Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said
"man delights not me"?

Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in
man, what lenten entertainment the players shall
receive from you. We coted them on the way;
and hither are they coming, to offer you service.

Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome;
his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous
knight shall use his foil and target; the
lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make
those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' the sere; and
the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank
verse shall halt for't. What players are they?

Ros. Even those you were wont to take delight
in, the tragedians of the city.

Ham. How chances it they travel? their residence,
both in reputation and profit, was better
both ways.

Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means
of the late innovation.

Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they
did when I was in the city? are they so followed?

Ros. No, indeed, are they not.

Ham. How comes it? do they grow rusty?

Ros. Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted
pace; but there is, sir, an aery of children, little
eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and
are most tyrannically clapped for't. These are
now the fashion, and so berattle the common
stages — so they call them — that many wearing
rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce
come thither.

Ham. What, are they children? who maintains
'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the
quality no longer than they can sing? will they
not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves
to common players — as it is most like,
if their means are no better — their writers do
them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
own succession?

Ros. 'Faith, there has been much to do on both
sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them
to controversy. There was, for a while, no money
bid for argument, unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.

Ham. Is't possible?

Guil. O, there has been much throwing about
of brains.

Ham. Do the boys carry it away?

Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and
his load too.

Ham. It is not very strange; for mine uncle is
King of Denmark, and those that would make
mows at him while my father lived, give twenty,
forty, fifty, an hundred ducats apiece for his
picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in
this more than natural, if philosophy could find it
out.

*Flourish of trumpets within.*

Guil. There are the players.

Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
Your hands, come then. The appurtenance of
welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
with you in this garb, lest my extent to the
players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outward,
should more appear like entertainment than
yours. You are welcome; but my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived.

Guil. In what, my dear lord?

Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When
the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a
handsaw.

*Re-enter Polonius.*

Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!

Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at
each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there
is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.

Ros. Happily he's the second time come to
them; for they say an old man is twice a child.

Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the
players; mark it. *[Aloud.]* You say right, sir:
o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.

Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.

Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When
Roscius was an actor in Rome —

Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.

Ham. Buz, buz!

Pol. Upon mine honor —

Ham. Then came each actor on his ass —

Pol. The best actors in the world, either for
tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-
comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable,
or poem unlimited; Seneca cannot be
too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of
writ and the liberty, these are the only men.

Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure
hadst thou!

Pol. What a treasure had he, my lord?

Ham. Why,
"One fair daughter, and no more,
The which he loved passing well."

Pol. *[Aside.]* Still on my daughter.

Ham. Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a
daughter that I love passing well.

Ham. Nay, that follows not.

Pol. What follows, then, my lord?

Ham. Why,
"As by lot, God wot,"
and then, you know,
"It came to pass, as most like it was"—
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgment comes.

*Enter four or five Players.*

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am
glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends.
O, my old friend! thy face is valanced since I
saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in Denmark?
What, my young lady and mistress! By'r
lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when
I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray
God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold,
be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are
all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers,
fly at anything we see: we'll have a speech
straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality;
come, a passionate speech.

1st Play. What speech, my lord?

Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but
it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once;
for the play, I remember, pleased not the million;
'twas caviare to the general; but it was — as I
received it, and others, whose judgments in such
matters cried in the top of mine — an excellent
play, well digested in the scenes, set down with
as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one
said there were no sallets in the lines to make the
matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that
might indict the author of affectation; but called
it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and
by very much more handsome than fine. One
speech in it I chiefly loved: 'twas *Aeneas'* tale to
Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he
speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your
memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me
see —
"The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast"—
it is not so. It begins with Pyrrhus:
"The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks."
So, proceed you.

Pol. 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with
good accent and good discretion.

1st Play. "Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear; for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick.
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter.
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause.
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armor forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod, take away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!"

Pol. This is too long.

Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.
Prithee, say on; he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,
or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.

1st Play. "But who, O, who had seen the mobled
queen — "

Ham. "The mobled queen"?

Pol. That's good; "mobled queen" is good.

1st Play. "Run barefoot up and down, threatening
the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamor that she made,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods!"

Pol. Look, whether he has not turned his color
and has tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.

Ham. 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest
soon. Good my lord, will you see the players
well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well
used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles
of the time; after your death you were
better have a bad epitaph than their ill report
while you live.

Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their
desert.

Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better. Use
every man after his desert, and who should 'scape
whipping? Use them after your own honor and
dignity; the less they deserve, the more merit is
in your bounty. Take them in.

Pol. Come, sirs.

Ham. Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play
to-morrow. *[Exit Polonius with all the Players but the First.]* Dost thou hear me, old friend;
can you play *The Murder of Gonzago*?

1st Play. Ay, my lord.

Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could,
for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen
lines, which I would set down and insert
in't, could you not?

1st Play. Ay, my lord.

Ham. Very well. Follow that lord; and look
you mock him not. *[Exit First Player.]* My
good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.

Ros. Good my lord!

Ham. Ay, so, God be wi' ye; *[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]* Now I am alone.

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,

Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil; and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
More relative than this. The play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.

[Exit.]

## ACT III

### Scene i. A room in the castle

_Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern._

**King.** And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

**Ros.** He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause he will by no means speak.

**Guil.** Nor do we find him forward to be sounded.
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.

**Queen.** Did he receive you well?

**Ros.** Most like a gentleman.

**Guil.** But with much forcing of his disposition.

**Ros.** Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.

**Queen.** Did you assay him
To any pastime?

**Ros.** Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way; of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.

**Pol.** 'Tis most true.
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
To hear and see the matter.

**King.** With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

**Ros.** We shall, my lord.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**King.** Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia.
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.

**Queen.** I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

**Oph.** Madam, I wish it may.

[Exit Queen.]

**Pol.** Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.
[To Ophelia] Read on this book;
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this—
'Tis too much proved—that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.

**King.** [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
O heavy burden!

**Pol.** I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

[Exeunt King and Polonius.]

_Enter Hamlet._

**Ham.** To be, or not to be: that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die; to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep? perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action. — Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

**Oph.** Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?

**Ham.** I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

**Oph.** My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.

**Ham.** No, not I;
I never gave you aught.

**Oph.** My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

**Ham.** Ha, ha! are you honest?

**Oph.** My lord?

**Ham.** Are you fair?

**Oph.** What means your lordship?

**Ham.** That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

**Oph.** Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?

**Ham.** Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.

**Oph.** Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

**Ham.** You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.

**Oph.** I was the more deceived.

**Ham.** Get thee to a nunnery; why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?

**Oph.** At home, my lord.

**Ham.** Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.

**Oph.** O, help him, you sweet heavens!

**Ham.** If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go. Farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.

**Oph.** O heavenly powers, restore him!

**Ham.** I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.

[Exit.]

**Oph.** O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword,
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

_Re-enter King and Polonius._

**King.** Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

**Pol.** It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

**King.** It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

[Exeunt.]

## Scene ii. A hall in the castle

_Enter Hamlet and Players._

**Ham.** Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.

**First Player.** I warrant your honour.

**Ham.** Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

**First Player.** I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.

**Ham.** O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

[Exeunt Players.]

_Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern._

How now, my lord! will the King hear this piece of work?

**Pol.** And the Queen too, and that presently.

**Ham.** Bid the players make haste.

[Exit Polonius.]

Will you two help to hasten them?

**Guil.** We will, my lord.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**Ham.** What ho! Horatio!

_Enter Horatio._

**Hor.** Here, sweet lord, at your service.

**Ham.** Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

**Hor.** O, my dear lord—

**Ham.** Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee. — Something too much of this. —
There is a play to-night before the King.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.

**Hor.** Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

**Ham.** They are coming to the play; I must be idle.
Get you a place.

_Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others._

**King.** How fares our cousin Hamlet?

**Ham.** Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed capons so.

**King.** I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.

**Ham.** No, nor mine now.
[To Polonius] My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

**Pol.** That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

**Ham.** What did you enact?

**Pol.** I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me.

**Ham.** It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?

**Ros.** Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

**Queen.** Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

**Ham.** No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

**Pol.** [To the King] O, ho! do you mark that?

**Ham.** Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

[Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]

**Oph.** No, my lord.

**Ham.** I mean, my head upon your lap?

**Oph.** Ay, my lord.

**Ham.** Do you think I meant country matters?

**Oph.** I think nothing, my lord.

**Ham.** That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

**Oph.** What is, my lord?

**Ham.** Nothing.

**Oph.** You are merry, my lord.

**Ham.** Who, I?

**Oph.** Ay, my lord.

**Ham.** O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

**Oph.** Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

**Ham.** So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year; but, by'r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is "For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot."

_Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters._

_Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck; lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love._

[Exeunt.]

**Oph.** What means this, my lord?

**Ham.** Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

**Oph.** Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

_Enter Prologue._

**Ham.** We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.

**Oph.** Will he tell us what this show meant?

**Ham.** Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

**Oph.** You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

**Pro.** For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.

[Exit.]

**Ham.** Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

**Oph.** 'Tis brief, my lord.

**Ham.** As woman's love.

_Enter two Players as King and Queen._

**P. King.** Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

**P. Queen.** So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
For women's fear and love holds quantity.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

**P. King.** 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do;
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved: and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou —

**P. Queen.** O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

**Ham.** [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.

**P. Queen.** The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.

**P. King.** But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity:
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

**P. Queen.** Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

**Ham.** If she should break it now!

**P. King.** 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.

[Sleeps.]

**P. Queen.** Sleep rock thy brain;
And never come mischance between us twain!

[Exit.]

**Ham.** Madam, how like you this play?

**Queen.** The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

**Ham.** O, but she'll keep her word.

**King.** Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?

**Ham.** No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world.

**King.** What do you call the play?

**Ham.** "The Mouse-trap." Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work, but what o' that? your Majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.

_Enter Lucianus._

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.

**Oph.** You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

**Ham.** I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.

**Oph.** You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

**Ham.** It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

**Oph.** Still better, and worse.

**Ham.** So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come, "the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge."

**Luc.** Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.

_Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears._

**Ham.** He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago; the story is extant, and writ in choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

**Oph.** The King rises.

**Ham.** What, frighted with false fire!

**Queen.** How fares my lord?

**Pol.** Give o'er the play.

**King.** Give me some light. Away!

**All.** Lights, lights, lights!

[Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]

**Ham.** Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep;
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers—if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me—with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

**Hor.** Half a share.

**Ham.** A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very—pajock.

**Hor.** You might have rhymed.

**Ham.** O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?

**Hor.** Very well, my lord.

**Ham.** Upon the talk of the poisoning?

**Hor.** I did very well note him.

**Ham.** Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the King like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!

_Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._

**Guil.** Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

**Ham.** Sir, a whole history.

**Guil.** The King, sir—

**Ham.** Ay, sir, what of him?

**Guil.** Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

**Ham.** With drink, sir?

**Guil.** No, my lord, rather with choler.

**Ham.** Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to

**HAMLET.**
put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge
him into far more choler.

**GUILDENSTERN.** Good my lord, put your discourse into
some frame and start not so wildly from my affair.

**HAMLET.** I am tame, sir; pronounce.

**GUILDENSTERN.** The Queen, your mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

**HAMLET.** You are welcome.

**GUILDENSTERN.** Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not
of the right breed. If it shall please you to make
me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s
commandment; if not, your pardon and my re-
turn shall be the end of my business.

**HAMLET.** Sir, I cannot.

**GUILDENSTERN.** What, my lord?

**HAMLET.** Make you a wholesome answer; my
wit’s diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can
make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say,
my mother. Therefore no more, but to the mat-
ter. My mother, you say,—

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Then thus she says: your behaviour hath
struck her into amazement and admiration.

**HAMLET.** O wonderful son, that can so astonish a
mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this
mother’s admiration? Impart.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** She desires to speak with you in her closet,
ere you go to bed.

**HAMLET.** We shall obey, were she ten times our
mother. Have you any further trade with us?

**ROSENCRANTZ.** My lord, you once did love me.

**HAMLET.** So I do still, by these pickers and
stealers.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Good my lord, what is your cause of dis-
temper? You do, surely, bar the door upon your
own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your
friend.

**HAMLET.** Sir, I lack advancement.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** How can that be, when you have the voice
of the King himself for your succession in Den-
mark?

**HAMLET.** Ay, sir, but, "While the grass grows"—
the proverb is something musty.

[Re-enter Players with recorders.]

**HAMLET.** O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw
with you:—why do you go about to recover the
wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?

**GUILDENSTERN.** O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my
love is too unmannerly.

**HAMLET.** I do not well understand that. Will you
play upon this pipe?

**GUILDENSTERN.** My lord, I cannot.

**HAMLET.** I pray you.

**GUILDENSTERN.** Believe me, I cannot.

**HAMLET.** I do beseech you.

**GUILDENSTERN.** I know no touch of it, my lord.

**HAMLET.** 'Tis as easy as lying. Govern these
ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it
breath with your mouth, and it will discourse
most eloquent music. Look you, these are the
stops.

**GUILDENSTERN.** But these cannot I command to any utter-
ance of harmony; I have not the skill.

**HAMLET.** Why, look you now, how unworthy a
thing you make of me! You would play upon
me; you would seem to know my stops; you
would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you
would sound me from my lowest note to the top
of my compass; and there is much music, excel-
lent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you
make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier
to be played on than a pipe? Call me what in-
strument you will, though you can fret me, yet
you cannot play upon me.

[Enter Polonius.]

**HAMLET.** God bless you, sir!

**POLONIUS.** My lord, the Queen would speak with
you, and presently.

**HAMLET.** Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in
shape of a camel?

**POLONIUS.** By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

**HAMLET.** Methinks it is like a weasel.

**POLONIUS.** It is backed like a weasel.

**HAMLET.** Or like a whale?

**POLONIUS.** Very like a whale.

**HAMLET.** Then I will come to my mother by and
by. They fool me to the top of my bent. I will
come by and by.

**POLONIUS.** I will say so.

**HAMLET.** By and by is easily said. [Exit Polonius.]
Leave me, friends.

[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

**HAMLET.**
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes
out
Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot
blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my
mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

[Exit.]

## ACT III
### Scene III. A room in the castle

[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]

**KING.**
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare
you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.

**GUILDENSTERN.**
We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your Majesty.

**ROSENCRANTZ.**
The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.

**KING.**
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.

**ROSENCRANTZ** and **GUILDENSTERN.**
We will haste us.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
[Enter Polonius.]

**POLONIUS.**
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him
home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

**KING.** Thanks, dear my lord.

[Exit Polonius.]

**KING.**
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will.
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? "Forgive me my foul murder"?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
Try what repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of
steel,
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
All may be well.

[Retires and kneels.]
[Enter Hamlet.]

**HAMLET.**
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd.
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent.
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

[Exit.]

**KING.** [Rising]
My words fly up, my thoughts
remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

[Exit.]

### Scene IV. The Queen's closet

[Enter Queen and Polonius.]

**POLONIUS.**
He will come straight. Look you lay home
to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear
with,
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood be-
tween
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

**HAMLET.** [Within] Mother, mother, mother!

**QUEEN.**
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming.

[Polonius hides behind the arras.]
[Enter Hamlet.]

**HAMLET.** Now, mother, what's the matter?

**QUEEN.** Hamlet, thou hast thy father much
offended.

**HAMLET.** Mother, you have my father much
offended.

**QUEEN.** Come, come, you answer with an idle
tongue.

**HAMLET.** Go, go, you question with a wicked
tongue.

**QUEEN.** Nay, how now, Hamlet!

**HAMLET.** What's the matter now?

**QUEEN.** Have you forgot me?

**HAMLET.** No, by the rood, not so:
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's
wife;
And—would it were not so!—you are my
mother.

**QUEEN.** Nay, then. I'll set those to you that can
speak.

**HAMLET.**
Come, come, and sit you down; you
shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

**QUEEN.** What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!

**POLONIUS.** [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

**HAMLET.** [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a
ducat, dead!

[Makes a pass through the arras.]

**POLONIUS.** [Behind] O, I am slain!

[Falls and dies.]

**QUEEN.** O me, what hast thou done?

**HAMLET.** Nay, I know not:
Is it the King?

**QUEEN.** O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

**HAMLET.**
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good
mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

**QUEEN.** As kill a king!

**HAMLET.** Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

[Lifts up the arras and discovers Polonius.]

**HAMLET.**
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you
down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it be proof and bulwark against sense.

**QUEEN.** What have I done, that thou darest wag
thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

**HAMLET.**
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths; O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words. Heaven's face doth glow;
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.

**QUEEN.** Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

**HAMLET.**
Look here, upon this picture, and on
this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now, what
follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you
eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgement; and what judge-
ment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you
have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that
sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.

**QUEEN.** O Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

**HAMLET.** Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making
love
Over the nasty sty—

**QUEEN.** O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!

**HAMLET.**
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!

**QUEEN.** No more!

**HAMLET.** A king of shreds and patches—

[Enter Ghost.]

**HAMLET.**
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious
figure?

**QUEEN.** Alas, he's mad!

**HAMLET.** Do you not come your tardy son to
chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?
O, say!

**GHOST.**
Do not forget! This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O, step between her and her fighting soul.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, Hamlet.

**HAMLET.** How is it with you, lady?

**QUEEN.** Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Start up, and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

**HAMLET.** On him, on him! Look you, how pale he
glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon
me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects; then what I have to do
Will want true colour, tears perchance for blood.

**QUEEN.** To whom do you speak this?

**HAMLET.** Do you see nothing there?

**QUEEN.** Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

**HAMLET.** Nor did you nothing hear?

**QUEEN.** No, nothing but ourselves.

**HAMLET.**
Why, look you there! Look, how it steals
away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

[Exit Ghost.]

**QUEEN.**
This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.

**HAMLET.** Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
That I have utter'd. Bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my
virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

**QUEEN.** O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in
twain.

**HAMLET.**
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night; but go not to mine uncle's bed.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either master the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,

[Pointing to Polonius.]

**HAMLET.**
I do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind.
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.

**QUEEN.** What shall I do?

**HAMLET.**
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his
mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reeky kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him
know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.

**QUEEN.**
Be thou assured, if words be made of
breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.

**HAMLET.** I must to England; you know that?

**QUEEN.** Alack,
I had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on.

**HAMLET.**
There's letters seal'd, and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my
way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard; and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing.
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.

[Exeunt severally; Hamlet dragging in Polonius.]

## ACT IV
### Scene I. A room in the castle

[Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]

**KING.**
There's matter in these sighs; these pro-
found heaves
You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?

**QUEEN.** Bestow this place on us a little while.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**QUEEN.** Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!

**KING.** What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

**QUEEN.**
Mad as the sea and wind, when both
contend
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, "A rat, a rat!"
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.

**KING.**
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of
haunt,
This mad young man. But so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?

**QUEEN.**
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd,
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

**KING.**
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

[Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**KING.**
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd
him.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**KING.**
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done; so, haply, slander,
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our
name,
And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

[Exeunt.]

### Scene II. Another room in the castle

[Enter Hamlet.]

**HAMLET.** Safely stowed.

**GUILDENSTERN.** [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

**HAMLET.** But soft, what noise? Who calls on
Hamlet? O, here they come.

[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**ROSENCRANTZ.** What have you done, my lord, with the
dead body?

**HAMLET.** Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis
kin.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it
thence
And bear it to the chapel.

**HAMLET.** Do not believe it.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Believe what?

**HAMLET.** That I can keep your counsel and not
mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge,
what replication should be made by the son of a
king?

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

**HAMLET.** Ay, sir, that soaks up the King's coun-
tenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such
officers do the King best service in the end. He
keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his
jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed. When
he needs what you have gleaned, it is but
squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry
again.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** I understand you not, my lord.

**HAMLET.** I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps
in a foolish ear.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** My lord, you must tell us where the body
is, and go with us to the King.

**HAMLET.** The body is with the King, but the
King is not with the body. The King is a thing—

**GUILDENSTERN.** A thing, my lord!

**HAMLET.** Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox,
and all after.

[Exeunt.]

### Scene III. Another room in the castle

[Enter King, attended.]

**KING.**
I have sent to seek him, and to find the
body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes:
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is
weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and
even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.

[Enter Rosencrantz.]

**KING.** How now! What hath befall'n?

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Where the dead body is bestow'd, my
lord,
We cannot get from him.

**KING.** But where is he?

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Without, my lord; guarded, to know your
pleasure.

**KING.** Bring him before us.

**ROSENCRANTZ.** Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

[Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]

**KING.** Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

**HAMLET.** At supper.

**KING.** At supper! Where?

**HAMLET.** Not where he eats, but where he is
eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms
are e'en at him. Your worm is your only em-
peror for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat
us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat
king and your lean beggar is but variable service,
two dishes, but to one table; that's the end.

**KING.** Alas, alas!

**HAMLET.** A man may fish with the worm that hath
eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of
that worm.

**KING.** What dost thou mean by this?

**HAMLET.** Nothing but to show you how a king
may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.

**KING.** Where is Polonius?

**HAMLET.** In heaven; send thither to see. If your
messenger find him not there, seek him i' the
other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him
not within this month, you shall nose him as you
go up the stairs into the lobby.

**KING.** Go seek him there.

[To some Attendants.]

**HAMLET.** He will stay till you come.

[Exeunt Attendants.]

**KING.**
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial
safety—
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done—must send thee
hence
With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thy-
self;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and everything is bent
For England.

**HAMLET.** For England!

**KING.** Ay, Hamlet.

**HAMLET.** Good.

**KING.** So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

**HAMLET.** I see a cherub that sees them. But, come;
for England! Farewell, dear mother.

**KING.** Thy loving father, Hamlet.

**HAMLET.** My mother. Father and mother is man
and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my
mother. Come, for England!

[Exit.]

**KING.**
Follow him at foot; tempt him with
speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
Away! For everything is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair. Pray you, make
haste.

[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

**KING.**
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught—
As my great power thereof may give thee
sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us—thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

[Exit.]

### Scene IV. A plain in Denmark

[Enter Fortinbras, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching.]

**FORTINBRAS.**
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish
king:
Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his Majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.

**CAPTAIN.** I will do't, my lord.

**FORTINBRAS.** Go softly on.

[Exeunt Fortinbras and Soldiers.]
[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]

**HAMLET.** Good sir, whose powers are these?

**CAPTAIN.** They are of Norway, sir.

**HAMLET.** How purposed, sir, I pray you?

**CAPTAIN.** Against some part of Poland.

**HAMLET.** Who commands them, sir?

**CAPTAIN.** The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.

**HAMLET.** Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?

**CAPTAIN.**
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

**HAMLET.** Why, then the Polack never will defend
it.

**CAPTAIN.** Yes, it is already garrison'd.

**HAMLET.** Two thousand souls and twenty thousand
ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw.

##  
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,  
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without  
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.  

Cap. God be wi' you, sir. [Exit.]

Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?  

Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before. [Exeunt all except Hamlet.]

How all occasions do inform against me,  
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,  
If his chief good and market of his time  
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.  

Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,  
Looking before and after, gave us not  
That capability and god-like reason  
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be  
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple  
Of thinking too precisely on the event,  
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom  
And ever three parts coward, I do not know  
Why yet I live to say "This thing's to do";  
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means  
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me;  
Witness this army of such mass and charge  
Led by a delicate and tender prince,  
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd  
Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
Exposing what is mortal and unsure  
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,  
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great  
Is not to stir without great argument,  
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw  
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,  
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,  
Excitements of my reason and my blood,  
And let me sleep? while, to my shame, I see  
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,  
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,  
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot  
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,  
Which is not tomb enough and continent  
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth  
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!  

[Exit.]

---

## Scene v. Elsinore: A room in the castle

Enter Queen, Horatio, and a Gentleman.

Queen. I will not speak with her.

Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract. Her mood will needs be pitied.

Queen. What would she have?

Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears  
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;  
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,  
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,  
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move  
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,  
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;  
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,  
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,  
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew  
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

Queen. Let her come in. [Exit Horatio.]

To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,  
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss;  
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,  
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

Re-enter Horatio, with Ophelia.

Oph. Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

Queen. How now, Ophelia!

Oph. [Sings] "How should I your true love know  
From another one?  
By his cockle hat and staff,  
And his sandal shoon."

Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

Oph. Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

[Sings] "He is dead and gone, lady,  
He is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone."

Queen. Nay, but, Ophelia—

Oph. Pray you, mark.

[Sings] "White his shroud as the mountain snow—"

Enter King.

Queen. Alas, look here, my lord.

Oph. [Sings] "Larded with sweet flowers;  
Which bewept to the grave did go  
With true-love showers."

King. How do you, pretty lady?

Oph. Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!

King. Conceit upon her father.

Oph. Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:

[Sings] "To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine.

Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,  
And dupp'd the chamber-door;  
Let in the maid, that out a maid  
Never departed more."

King. Pretty Ophelia!

Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:

[Sings] "By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
Alack, and fie for shame!  
Young men will do't, if they come to't;  
By cock, they are to blame.  
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,  
You promised me to wed.  
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,  
An thou hadst not come to my bed."

King. How long hath she been thus?

Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night. [Exit.]

King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. [Exit Horatio.]

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs  
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,  
When sorrows come, they come not single spies,  
But in battalions. First, her father slain;  
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author  
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,  
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,  
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,  
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia  
Divided from herself and her fair judgement,  
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts;  
Last, and as much containing as all these,  
Her brother is in secret come from France;  
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,  
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear  
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;  
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,  
Will nothing stick our person to arraign  
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,  
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places  
Gives me superfluous death.

A noise within.

Queen. Alack, what noise is this?

Enter another Gentleman.

King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. What is the matter?

Gent. Save yourself, my lord:  
The ocean, overpeering of his list,  
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste  
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,  
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;  
And, as the world were now but to begin,  
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,  
The ratifiers and props of every word,  
They cry, "Choose we: Laertes shall be king:"  
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:  
"Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!"

Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!

Laer. O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!—

King. The doors are broke.

Noise within.

Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.

Laer. Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.

Danes. No, let's come in.

Laer. I pray you, give me leave.

Danes. We will, we will.

[They retire without the door.]

Laer. I thank you; keep the door. O thou vile king,  
Give me my father!

Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.

Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,  
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot  
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow  
Of my true mother.

King. What is the cause, Laertes,  
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?  
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:  
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,  
That treason can but peep to what it would,  
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,  
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.  
Speak, man.

Laer. Where is my father?

King. Dead.

Queen. But not by him.

King. Let him demand his fill.

Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.  
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!  
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!  
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,  
That both the worlds I give to negligence,  
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged  
Most throughly for my father.

King. Who shall stay you?

Laer. My will, not all the world:  
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,  
They shall go far with little.

King. Good Laertes,  
If you desire to know the certainty  
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,  
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,  
Winner and loser?

Laer. None but his enemies.

King. Will you know them then?

Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;  
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,  
Repast them with my blood.

King. Why, now you speak  
Like a good child and a true gentleman.  
That I am guiltless of your father's death,  
And am most sensibly in grief for it,  
It shall as level to your judgement pierce  
As day does to your eye.

[Within] Danes. Let her come in.

Laer. How now! what noise is that?

Re-enter Ophelia.

O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,  
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!  
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight,  
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!  
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!  
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits  
Should be as mortal as an old man's life?  
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,  
It sends some precious instance of itself  
After the thing it loves.

Oph. [Sings]  
"They bore him barefaced on the bier;  
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;  
And in his grave rain'd many a tear" —  
Fare you well, my dove!

Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,  
It could not move thus.

Oph. [Sings] "You must sing a-down a-down,  
An you call him a-down-a."  
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter.

Laer. This nothing's more than matter.

Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love, remember; and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

Laer. A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines; there's rue for you, and here's some for me; we may call it herb-grace o' Sundays. O, you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end —

[Sings] "For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy."

Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,  
She turns to favour and to prettiness.

Oph. [Sings] "And will he not come again?  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead;  
Go to thy death-bed;  
He never will come again.  
His beard was as white as snow,  
All flaxen was his poll.  
He is gone, he is gone,  
And we cast away moan.  
God ha' mercy on his soul!"

And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye. [Exit.]

Laer. Do you see this, O God?

King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,  
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,  
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,  
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.  
If by direct or by collateral hand  
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,  
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,  
To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
Be you content to lend your patience to us,  
And we shall jointly labour with your soul  
To give it due content.

Laer. Let this be so;  
His means of death, his obscure funeral —  
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,  
No noble rite nor formal ostentation —  
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,  
That I must call't in question.

King. So you shall;  
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.  
I pray you, go with me. [Exeunt.]

## Scene vi. Another room in the castle

Enter Horatio and a Servant.

Hor. What are they that would speak with me?

Serv. Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.

Hor. Let them come in. [Exit Servant.]

I do not know from what part of the world  
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

Enter Sailors.

1st Sail. God bless you, sir.

Hor. Let him bless thee too.

1st Sail. He shall, sir, an't please Him.  
There's a letter for you, sir. It comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

Hor. [Reads] "Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the King; they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England; of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.

"He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet"

Come, I will make you way for these your letters;  
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me  
To him from whom you brought them. [Exeunt.]

---

## Scene vii. Another room in the castle

Enter King and Laertes.

King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,  
And you must put me in your heart for friend,  
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,  
That he which hath your noble father slain  
Pursued my life.

Laer. It well appears: but tell me  
Why you proceeded not against these feats,  
So crimeful and so capital in nature,  
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,  
You mainly were stirr'd up.

King. O, for two special reasons;  
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,  
But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother  
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself —  
My virtue or my plague, be it either which —  
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,  
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
I could not but by her. The other motive,  
Why to a public count I might not go,  
Is the great love the general gender bear him;  
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,  
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,  
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,  
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,  
Would have reverted to my bow again,  
And not where I had aim'd them.

Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;  
A sister driven into desperate terms,  
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,  
Stood challenger on mount of all the age  
For her perfections. But my revenge will come.

King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think  
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull  
That we can let our beard be shook with danger  
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.  
I loved your father, and we love ourself;  
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—

Enter a Messenger.

How now! what news?

Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.

King. From Hamlet! who brought them?

Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:  
They were given me by Claudio; he received them  
Of him that brought them.

King. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us, messenger.

[Reads] "High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.

"Hamlet"

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?  
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

Laer. Know you the hand?

King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. "Naked!"  
And in a postscript here, he says "alone."  
Can you advise me?

Laer. I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;  
It warms the very sickness in my heart,  
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,  
"Thus didst thou."

King. If it be so, Laertes —  
As how should it be so? how otherwise? —  
Will you be ruled by me?

Laer. Ay, my lord;  
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,  
As checking at his voyage, and that he means  
No more to undertake it, I will work him  
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,  
Under the which he shall not choose but fall;  
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,  
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
And call it accident.

Laer. My lord, I will be ruled;  
The rather, if you could devise it so  
That I might be the organ.

King. It falls right.  
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,  
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality  
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts  
Did not together pluck such envy from him  
As did that one, and that, in my regard,  
Of the unworthiest siege.

Laer. What part is that, my lord?

King. A very riband in the cap of youth,  
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes  
The light and careless livery that it wears  
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,  
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,  
Here was a gentleman of Normandy;  
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,  
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant  
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;  
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,  
As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured  
With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought,  
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,  
Come short of what he did.

Laer. A Norman was't?

King. A Norman.

Laer. Upon my life, Lamond.

King. The very same.

Laer. I know him well. He is the brooch indeed  
And gem of all the nation.

King. He made confession of you,  
And gave you such a masterly report  
For art and exercise in your defence  
And for your rapier most especial,  
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,  
If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation,  
He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,  
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his  
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy  
That he could nothing do but wish and beg  
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.  
Now, out of this—

Laer. What out of this, my lord?

King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?  
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,  
A face without a heart?

Laer. Why ask you this?

King. Not that I think you did not love your father;  
But that I know love is begun by time;  
And that I see, in passages of proof,  
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.  
There lives within the very flame of love  
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;  
And nothing is at a like goodness still;  
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,  
Dies in his own too much. That we would do,  
We should do when we would; for this "would" changes  
And hath abatements and delays as many  
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;  
And then this "should" is like a spendthrift sigh,  
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer—

Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake,  
To show yourself your father's son in deed  
More than in words?

Laer. To cut his throat i' the church.

King. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;  
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,  
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.  
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.  
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence  
And set a double varnish on the fame  
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together  
And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,  
Most generous and free from all contriving,  
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,  
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose  
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice  
Requite him for your father.

Laer. I will do't;  
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.  
I bought an unction of a mountebank,  
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,  
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,  
Collected from all simples that have virtue  
Under the moon, can save the thing from death  
That is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point  
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,  
It may be death.

King. Let's further think of this;  
Weigh what convenience both of time and means  
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,  
And that our drift look through our bad performance,  
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project  
Should have a back or second, that might hold,  
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:  
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings.  
I ha't:  
When in your motion you are hot and dry—  
As make your bouts more violent to that end—  
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him  
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,  
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,  
Our purpose may hold there.

Enter Queen.

How now, sweet queen!

Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,  
So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

Laer. Drown'd! O, where?

Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,  
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;  
There with fantastic garlands did she come  
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples  
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,  
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them;  
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds  
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;  
When down her weedy trophies and herself  
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;  
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;  
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;  
As one incapable of her own distress,  
Or like a creature native and indued  
Unto that element. But long it could not be  
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,  
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay  
To muddy death.

Laer. Alas, then, she is drown'd?

Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.

Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,  
And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet  
It is our trick; Nature her custom holds,  
Let shame say what it will; when these are gone,  
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:  
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,  
But that this folly douts it. [Exit.]

King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
How much I had to do to calm his rage!  
Now fear I this will give it start again;  
Therefore let's follow. [Exeunt.]

## Scene i. A churchyard

Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.

1st Clo. Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?

2nd Clo. I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight. The coroner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.

1st Clo. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?

2nd Clo. Why, 'tis found so.

1st Clo. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.

2nd Clo. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—

1st Clo. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

2nd Clo. But is this law?

1st Clo. Ay, marry, is't; coroner's quest law.

2nd Clo. Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.

1st Clo. Why, there thou say'st; and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam's profession.

2nd Clo. Was he a gentleman?

1st Clo. A' was the first that ever bore arms.

2nd Clo. Why, he had none.

1st Clo. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says "Adam digged"; could he dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—

2nd Clo. Go to.

1st Clo. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

2nd Clo. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.

1st Clo. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill. Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.

2nd Clo. "Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?"

1st Clo. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

2nd Clo. Marry, now I can tell.

1st Clo. To't.

2nd Clo. Mass, I cannot tell.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.

1st Clo. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say "a grave-maker": the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a stoup of liquor.

[Exit Second Clown.]

He digs, and sings.

"In youth, when I did love, did love,  
Methought it was very sweet,  
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,  
O, methought, there was nothing meet."

Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?

Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.

1st Clo. [Sings]  
"But age, with his stealing steps,  
Hath claw'd me in his clutch, so  
And hath shipped me into the land,  
As if I had never been such."

Throws up a skull.

Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?

Hor. It might, my lord.

Ham. Or of a courtier; which could say "Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?" This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that praised my Lord Such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?

Hor. Ay, my lord.

Ham. Why, e'en so; and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.

1st Clo. [Sings]  
"A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,  
For and a shrouding sheet;  
O, a pit of clay for to be made  
For such a guest is meet."

Throws up another skull.

Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures?

**HAMLET**

## ACT V

### Scene I

*A churchyard.*

**Ham.** The very conveyances of his lands will hardly
lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself
have no more, ha?

**Hor.** Not a jot more, my lord.

**Ham.** Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?

**Hor.** Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.

**Ham.** They are sheep and calves which seek
out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.
Whose grave’s this, sirrah?

**1st Clo.** Mine, sir.

*Sings*
> “O, a pit of clay for to be made
> For such a guest is meet.” 130

**Ham.** I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest
in’t.

**1st Clo.** You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore it is
not yours. For my part, I do not lie in’t, and yet
it is mine.

**Ham.** Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is
thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; there¬
fore thou liest.

**1st Clo.** ’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’twill away again,
from me to you. 140

**Ham.** What man dost thou dig it for?

**1st Clo.** For no man, sir.

**Ham.** What woman, then?

**1st Clo.** For none, neither.

**Ham.** Who is to be buried in’t?

**1st Clo.** One that was a woman, sir; but, rest
her soul, she’s dead.

**Ham.** How absolute the knave is! we must
speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.
By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have
taken note of it; the age is grown so picked that
the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of
the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long hast
thou been a grave-maker?

**1st Clo.** Of all the days i' the year, I came to ’t
that day that our last king Hamlet overcame
Fortinbras.

**Ham.** How long is that since?

**1st Clo.** Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell
that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was
born; he that is mad, and sent into England.

**Ham.** Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

**1st Clo.** Why, because he was mad. He shall
recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it’s no
great matter there.

**Ham.** Why?

**1st Clo.** ’Twill not be seen in him there; there
the men are as mad as he. 170

**Ham.** How came he mad?

**1st Clo.** Very strangely, they say.

**Ham.** How strangely?

**1st Clo.** Faith, e’en with losing his wits.

**Ham.** Upon what ground?

**1st Clo.** Why, here in Denmark. I have been
sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.

**Ham.** How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he
rot? 179

**1st Clo.** I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die
— as we have many pocky corses now-a-days,
that will scarce hold the laying in — he will last
you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will
last you nine year.

**Ham.** Why he more than another?

**1st Clo.** Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his
trade, that he will keep out water a great while;
and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson
dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull has
lain in the earth three and twenty years. 191

**Ham.** Whose was it?

**1st Clo.** A whoreson mad fellow’s it was. Whose
do you think it was?

**Ham.** Nay, I know not.

**1st Clo.** A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a’
poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.
This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the
King’s jester.

**Ham.** This? 200

**1st Clo.** E’en that.

**Ham.** Let me see. *[Takes the skull.]* Alas, poor
Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite
jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me
on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises
at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I
know not how oft. Where be your gibes now?
your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar?
Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite
chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber,
and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
favour she must come; make her laugh at that.
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

**Hor.** What’s that, my lord?

**Ham.** Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this
fashion i' the earth?

**Hor.** E’en so. 220

**Ham.** And smelt so? pah!

*Puts down the skull.*

**Hor.** E’en so, my lord.

**Ham.** To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
Why may not imagination trace the noble
dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

**Hor.** ’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider
so.

**Ham.** No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him
thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to
lead it; as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was
buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that
loam, whereto he was converted, might they not
stop a beer-barrel?

> Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,
> Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
> O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
> Should patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw!
> But soft, but soft! *aside*: here comes the King,

*Enter Priests, &c. in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.*

**Ham.** The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life. ’Twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.

*[Retiring with Horatio.]*

**Laer.** What ceremony else?

**Ham.** That is Laertes,
A very noble youth; mark.

**Laer.** What ceremony else?

**1st Priest.** Her obsequies have been as far enlarged 249
As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
And, but that great command o’ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her:
Yet here she is allow’d her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.

**Laer.** Must there no more be done?

**First Priest.** No more be done.
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her 260
As to peace-parted souls.

**Laer.** Lay her i' the earth,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.

**Ham.** What, the fair Ophelia!

**Queen.** Sweets to the sweet; farewell!

*Scattering flowers.*

> I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;
> I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,
> And not have strew’d thy grave.

**Laer.** O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, 270
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.

*Leaps into the grave.*

> Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
> Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
> To o’ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
> Of blue Olympus.

**Ham.** *[Advancing]* What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, 280
Hamlet the Dane. *[Leaps into the grave.]*

**Laer.** The devil take thy soul!

*Grappling with him.*

**Ham.** Thou pray’st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.

**King.** Pluck them asunder.

**Queen.** Hamlet, Hamlet!

**All.** Gentlemen—

**Hor.** Good my lord, be quiet.

*The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.*

**Ham.** Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag. 290

**Queen.** O my son, what theme?

**Ham.** I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

**King.** O, he is mad, Laertes.

**Queen.** For love of God, forbear him.

**Ham.** ’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do.
Woo’t weep? woo’t fight? woo’t fast? woo’t tear thyself?
Woo’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine? 300
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I;
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou’lt mouth,
I’ll rant as well as thou.

**Queen.** This is mere madness,
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed, 310
His silence will sit drooping.

**Ham.** Hear you, sir;
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever. But it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

*[Exit.]*

**King.** I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.

*[Exit Horatio.]*

*[To Laertes]* Strengthen your patience in our
last night’s speech;
We’ll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument. 320
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be. *[Exeunt.]*

### Scene II

*A hall in the castle.*

*Enter Hamlet and Horatio.*

**Ham.** So much for this, sir; now shall you see
the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?

**Hor.** Remember it, my lord!

**Ham.** Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us
There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, 10
Rough-hew them how we will—

**Hor.** That is most certain.

**Ham.** Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire,
Finger’d their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio—
O royal knavery!—an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons 20
Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.

**Hor.** Is’t possible?

**Ham.** Here’s the commission; read it at more
leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

**Hor.** I beseech you.

**Ham.** Being thus be-netted round with villainies—
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, 30
They had begun the play—I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour’d much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?

**Hor.** Ay, good my lord.

**Ham.** An earnest conjuration from the King,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish, 40
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma ’tween their amities,
And many such-like as’s of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow’d.

**Hor.** How was this seal’d?

**Ham.** Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father’s signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal; 50
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave’t the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know’st already.

**Hor.** So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.

**Ham.** Why, man, they did make love to this
employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow.
’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes 60
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.

**Hor.** Why, what a king is this!

**Ham.** Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now
upon—
He that hath kill’d my king and whored my mother,
Popp’d in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is’t not to be damn’d,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil? 70

**Hor.** It must be shortly known to him from
England
What is the issue of the business there.

**Ham.** It will be short; the interim is mine,
And a man’s life’s no more than to say “One.”
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.

**Hor.** Peace! who comes here? 80

*Enter Osric.*

**Osr.** Your lordship is right welcome back to
Denmark.

**Ham.** I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this
water-fly?

**Hor.** No, my good lord.

**Ham.** Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a
vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile;
let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib
shall stand at the King’s mess. ’Tis a chough;
but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt. 90

**Osr.** Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,
I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

**Ham.** I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for
the head.

**Osr.** I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

**Ham.** No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind
is northerly. 99

**Osr.** It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

**Ham.** But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot
for my complexion.

**Osr.** Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry—
as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid
a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter,—

**Ham.** I beseech you, remember—

*Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.*

**Osr.** Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good
faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes;
believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most
excellent differences, of very soft society and
great showing; indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall
find in him the continent of what part a gentleman
would see.

**Ham.** Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially
would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet
but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But,
in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul
of great article; and his infusion of such dearth
and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would
trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.

**Osr.** Your lordship speaks most infallibly of
him.

**Ham.** The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap
the gentleman in our more rawer breath?

**Osr.** Sir? 130

**Hor.** Is’t not possible to understand in another
tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.

**Ham.** What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

**Osr.** Of Laertes?

**Hor.** His purse is empty already; all’s golden
words are spent.

**Ham.** Of him, sir.

**Osr.** I know you are not ignorant—

**Ham.** I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you
did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

**Osr.** You are not ignorant of what excellence
Laertes is—

**Ham.** I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
with him in excellence; but, to know a man
well, were to know himself.

**Osr.** I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he’s
unfellowed. 150

**Ham.** What’s his weapon?

**Osr.** Rapier and dagger.

**Ham.** That’s two of his weapons; but, well.

**Osr.** The King, sir, hath wagered with him six
Barbary horses, against the which he has imponed,
as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards,
with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear
to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate
carriages, and of very liberal conceit.

**Ham.** What call you the carriages?

**Hor.** I knew you must be edified by the margent
ere you had done.

**Osr.** The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

**Ham.** The phrase would be more german to the
matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides; I
would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six
Barbary horses against six French swords, their
assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages;
that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is
this “imponed,” as you call it? 171

**Osr.** The King, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen
passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed
you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for
nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if
your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

**Ham.** How if I answer “no”?

**Osr.** I mean, my lord, the opposition of your
person in trial. 179

**Ham.** Sir, I will walk here in the hall; if it
please his Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day
with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman
willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win
for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but
my shame and the odd hits.

**Osr.** Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?

**Ham.** To this effect, sir; after what flourish
your nature will.

**Osr.** I commend my duty to your lordship.

**Ham.** Yours, yours. *[Exit Osric.]* He does well
to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
for’s turn.

**Hor.** This lapwing runs away with the shell on
his head.

**Ham.** He did comply with his dug, before he
sucked it. Thus has he—and many more of the
same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on
—only got the tune of the time and outward habit
of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which
carries them through and through the most fanned
and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them
to their trial, the bubbles are out.

*Enter a Lord.*

**Lord.** My Lord, his Majesty commended him
to you by young Osric, who brings back to him,
that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know
if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that
you will take longer time.

**Ham.** I am constant to my purposes; they follow
the King's pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is
ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able
as now. 211

**Lord.** The King and Queen and all are coming
down.

**Ham.** In happy time.

**Lord.** The Queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

**Ham.** She well instructs me. *[Exit Lord.]*

**Hor.** You will lose this wager, my lord.

**Ham.** I do not think so; since he went into
France, I have been in continual practice; I shall
win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how
ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.

**Hor.** Nay, good my lord—

**Ham.** It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

**Hor.** If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I
will forestall their repair hither, and say you are
not fit. 229

**Ham.** Not a whit, we defy augury. There's a
special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it
be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it
will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come;
the readiness is all. Since no man has aught of
what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes? Let be.

*Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, Lords, and Attendants with foils and gauntlets; a table and flagons of wine on it.*

**King.** Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand
from me.

*The King puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s.*

**Ham.** Give me your pardon, sir. I’ve done you
wrong;
But pardon’t, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish’d 240
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour, and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,
And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;
His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy. 250
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o’er the house,
And hurt my brother.

**Laer.** I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge; but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace, 260
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer’d love like love.
And will not wrong it.

**Ham.** I embrace it freely;
And will this brother’s wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.

**Laer.** Come, one for me.

**Ham.** I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.

**Laer.** You mock me, sir.

**Ham.** No, by this hand.

**King.** Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin
Hamlet, 270
You know the wager?

**Ham.** Very well, my lord;
Your Grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

**King.** I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.

**Laer.** This is too heavy, let me see another.

**Ham.** This likes me well. These foils have all a
length?

*They prepare to play.*

**Osr.** Ay, my good lord.

**King.** Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange, 280
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
“Now the King drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin;
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. 290

**Ham.** Come on, sir.

**Laer.** Come, my lord.

*They play.*

**Ham.** One.

**Laer.** No.

**Ham.** Judgment.

**Osr.** A hit, a very palpable hit.

**Laer.** Well; again.

**King.** Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is
thine;
Here’s to thy health.

*Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.*

> Give him the cup.

**Ham.** I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come. *[They play.]* Another hit; what say you?

**Laer.** A touch, a touch, I do confess.

**King.** Our son shall win.

**Queen.** He’s fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. 300

**Ham.** Good madam!

**King.** Gertrude, do not drink.

**Queen.** I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

**King.** *[Aside]* It is the poison’d cup; it is too
late.

**Ham.** I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

**Queen.** Come, let me wipe thy face.

**Laer.** My lord, I’ll hit him now.

**King.** I do not think’t.

**Laer.** *[Aside]* And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my
conscience.

**Ham.** Come, for the third, Laertes; you but
dally.
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me. 310

**Laer.** Say you so? come on.

*They play.*

**Osr.** Nothing, neither way.

**Laer.** Have at you now!

*Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.*

**King.** Part them; they are incensed.

**Ham.** Nay, come, again.

*The Queen falls.*

**Osr.** Look to the Queen there, ho!

**Hor.** They bleed on both sides. How is it, my
lord?

**Osr.** How is’t, Laertes?

**Laer.** Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe,
Osric;
I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.

**Ham.** How does the Queen?

**King.** She swoons to see them bleed.

**Queen.** No, no, the drink, the drink—O my dear
Hamlet— 320
The drink, the drink! I am poison’d. *[Dies.]*

**Ham.** O villainy! Ho! let the door be lock’d;
Treachery! Seek it out.

**Laer.** It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice
Hath turn’d itself on me; lo, here I lie, 325
Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.
I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.

**Ham.** The point envenom’d too!
Then, venom, to thy work.

*Stabs the King.*

**All.** Treason! treason!

**King.** O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

**Ham.** Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother. *[King dies.]*

**Laer.** He is justly served;
It is a poison temper’d by himself. 335
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me! *[Dies.]*

**Ham.** Heaven make thee free of it! I follow
thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audiences to this act,
Had I but time—as this fell sergeant, Death,
Is strict in his arrest—O, I could tell you—
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied. 357

**Hor.** Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane;
Here’s yet some liquor left.

**Ham.** As thou’rt a man,
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I’ll have’t.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story. 360

*March afar off, and shot within.*

> What warlike noise is this?

**Osr.** Young Fortinbras, with conquest come
from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.

**Ham.** O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from England,
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence. *[Dies.]*

**Hor.** Now cracks a noble heart. Good night,
sweet prince; 370
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?

*March within.*

*Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.*

**Fort.** Where is this sight?

**Hor.** What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

**Fort.** This quarry cries on havoc. O proud
Death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?

**1st Amb.** The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d, 381
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?

**Hor.** Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view; 389
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about. So shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall’n on the inventors’ heads: all this can I
Truly deliver.

**Fort.** Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

**Hor.** Of that I shall have also cause to speak,

And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently perform’d,
Even while men’s minds are wild; lest more mischance,
On plots and errors, happen.

Fort. Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally; and, for his passage,
The soldiers’ music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

[*A dead march. Exeunt*, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off.]

Scene: Windsor, and the neighborhood

### ACT I

#### Scene i. Windsor: before Page's house

Enter Justice Shallow, Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans.

Shal. Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.

Slen. In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and “Coram.”

Shal. Ay, cousin Slender, and “Custalorum.”

Slen. Ay, and “Rato-lorum” too; and a gentleman born, master parson; who writes himself “Armigero,” in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, “Armigero.”

Shal. Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.

Slen. All his successors gone before him have done’t; and all his ancestors that come after him may. They may give the dozen white luces in their coat.

Shal. It is an old coat.

Evans. The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.

Shal. The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.

Slen. I may quarter, coz.

Shal. You may, by marrying.

Evans. It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

Shal. Not a whit.

Evans. Yes, by’r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence to make atonements and compromises between you.

Shal. The council shall hear it; it is a riot.

Evans. It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in a riot. The council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your vizaments in that.

Shal. Ha! o’ my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.

Evans. It is better that friends be the sword, and end it; and there is also another device in my brain, which peradventure brings good discretions with it: there is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas Page, which is pretty virginity.

Slen. Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.

Evans. It is that very person for all the world, as just as you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his death’s-bed — Got deliver to a joyful resurrection! — give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old. It were a good motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
