### Works in This Volume

- **Don Quixote** (The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha) - The first modern novel and one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. An aging Spanish gentleman, driven mad by reading chivalric romances, reinvents himself as the knight-errant Don Quixote and sets out with his squire Sancho Panza to revive chivalry and right wrongs. His adventures—tilting at windmills he takes for giants, freeing galley slaves, and worshipping the peasant girl he imagines as his lady Dulcinea—are by turns comic, tragic, and profoundly moving. The novel explores the nature of reality and illusion, the power of literature, and the nobility of impossible dreams.
