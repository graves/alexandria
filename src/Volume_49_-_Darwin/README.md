## CHARLES DARWIN (1809-1882)

Charles Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, whose theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary biology. His work transformed our understanding of the natural world and humanity's place in it.

### Works in This Volume

- **The Origin of Species** - Darwin's revolutionary treatise presenting his theory of evolution by natural selection. Drawing on observations from his voyage on HMS Beagle and decades of subsequent research, Darwin argues that species evolve through the gradual accumulation of variations that enhance survival and reproduction.

- **The Descent of Man** - Darwin's application of evolutionary theory to human origins, arguing that humans descended from earlier primates. He also develops his theory of sexual selection and examines the evolution of human mental and moral faculties.
