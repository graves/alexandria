# SAMSON AGONISTES

## Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy

Tragedy, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other poems: therefore said by Aristotle to be of power, by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions; that is, to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for so in physic things of melancholic hue and quality are used against melancholy, sour against sour, salt to remove salt humours.

Hence philosophers and other gravest writers, as Cicero, Plutarch, and others, frequently cite out of tragic poets, both to adorn and illustrate their discourse. The Apostle Paul himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the text of Holy Scripture (1 Cor. 15:33), and Pareus, commenting on the *Revelation*, divides the whole book as a tragedy, into acts distinguish'd each by a chorus of heavenly harpings and song between.

Heretofore men in highest dignity have laboured not a little to be thought able to compose a tragedy. Of that honour Dionysius the Elder was no less ambitious than before of his attaining to the tyranny. Augustus Caesar also had begun his *Ajax*, but, unable to please his own judgment with what he had begun, left it unfinished. Seneca the philosopher is by some thought the author of those tragedies (at least the best of them) that go under that name. Gregory Nazianzen, a Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a tragedy, which he entitl'd *Christ Suffering*. This is mention'd to vindicate tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common interludes; happening through the poet's error of intermixing comic stuff with tragic sadness and gravity, or introducing trivial and vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath been counted absurd, and brought in without discretion, corruptly to gratify the people.

And though ancient tragedy use no prologue, yet using sometimes, in case of self-defence or explanation, that which Martial calls an epistle; in behalf of this tragedy coming forth after the ancient manner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus much beforehand may be said: that chorus is here introduc'd after the Greek manner, not ancient only but modern, and still in use among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of this poem, with good reason, the ancients and Italians are rather followed, as of much more authority and fame. The measure of verse used in the chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks monostrophic, or rather *apolelymenon*, without regard had to strophe, antistrophe, or epode, which were a kind of stanzas fram'd only for the music then used with the chorus that sung; not essential to the poem, and therefore not material; or, being divided into stanzas or pauses, they may be call'd allocostropha. Division into act and scene referring chiefly to the stage (to which this work never was intended) is here omitted.

It suffices if the whole drama be found not produc'd beyond the fifth act, of the style and uniformity, and that commonly call'd the plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such economy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three tragic poets unequalled yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavour to write tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein the whole drama begins and ends is, according to ancient rule and best example, within the space of twenty-four hours.

# SAMSON AGONISTES

### THE ARGUMENT

Samson made captive, blind, and now in the prison at Gaza, to labour as in a common work-house; on a festival day, the general cessation from labour comes forth into the open air to a place nigh, somewhat retir'd, there to sit a while and bemoan his condition. Where he happens at length to be visited by certain friends and equals of his tribe, which make the chorus, who seek to comfort him what they can; then by his old father Manoah, who endeavours the like, and withal tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; lastly, this feast was proclaim'd by the Philistines as a day of thanksgiving for their deliverance from the hands of Samson, which yet more troubles him. Manoah then departs to prosecute his endeavour with the Philistine lords for Samson's redemption; who in the meanwhile is visited by other persons; and lastly by a public officer to require his coming to the feast before the lords and people, to play or shew his strength in their presence: he at first refuses, dismissing the public officer with absolute denial to come; at length, persuaded inwardly that this was from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the second time with great threatnings to fetch him. The chorus yet remaining on the place, Manoah returns full of joyful hope to procure ere long his son's deliverance: in the midst of which discourse an Hebrew comes in haste, confusedly at first, and afterward more distinctly relating the catastrophe what Samson had done to the Philistines, and by accident to himself; wherewith the tragedy ends.

**Sam.** A little onward lend thy guiding hand  
To these dark steps, a little further on;  

For yonder bank hath choice of sun or shade;  
There I am wont to sit, when any chance  
Relieves me from my task of servile toil,  
Daily in the common prison else enjoin'd me,  
Where I, a prisoner chain'd, scarce freely draw  
The air imprison'd also, close and damp,  
Unwholesome draught: but here I feel amends,  
The breath of Heav'n fresh-blowing, pure and sweet,  
With day-spring born; here leave me to respire.

This day a solemn feast the people hold  
To Dagon their sea-idol, and forbid  
Laborious works; unwillingly this rest  
Their superstition yields me; hence with leave  
Retiring from the popular noise, I seek  
This unfrequented place to find some ease,  
Ease to the body some, none to the mind  
From restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm  
Of hornets arm'd, no sooner found alone  
But rush upon me thronging, and present  
Times past, what once I was, and what I am now.

O wherefore was my birth from heaven foretold  
Twice by an angel, who at last in sight  
Of both my parents all in flames ascendèd  
From off the altar, where an offering burn'd,  
As in a fiery column charioting  
His godlike presence, and from some great act  
Or benefit reveal'd to Abraham's race?  
Why was my breeding order'd and prescrib'd  
As of a person separate to God,  
Design'd for great exploits; if I must die  
Betray'd, captiv'd, and both my eyes put out,  
Made of my enemies the scorn and gaze;  
To grind in brazen fetters under task  
With this heav'n-gifted strength? O glorious strength  
Put to the labour of a beast, debas'd,  
Lower than bondslave! Promise was that I  
Should Israel from Philistian yoke deliver;  
Ask for this great deliverer now, and find him  
Eyeless in Gaza at the mill with slaves,  
Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke:  
Yet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt  
Divine prediction; what if all foretold  
Had been fulfill'd but through mine own default,  
Whom have I to complain of but myself?  
Who this high gift of strength committed to me,  
In what part lodg'd, how easily bereft me,  
Under the seal of silence could not keep,  
But weakly to a woman must reveal it;  
O'ercome with importunity and tears.  
O impotence of mind, in body strong!  
But what is strength without a double share  
Of wisdom, vast, unwieldy, burdensome,  
Proudly secure, yet liable to fall  
By weakest subtilties, not made to rule,  
But to subserve where wisdom bears command.  
God, when he gave me strength, to shew withal  
How slight the gift was, hung it in my hair.

But peace, I must not quarrel with the will  
Of highest dispensation, which herein  
Happily had ends above my reach to know:  
Suffices that to me strength is my bane,  
And proves the source of all my miseries;  
So many, and so huge, that each apart  
Would ask a life to wail, but chief of all,  
O loss of sight, of thee I most complain!  
Blind among enemies, O worse than chains,  
Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age!  
Light the prime work of God to me is extinct,  
And all her various objects of delight  
Annull'd, which might in part my grief have eased,  
Inferior to the vilest now become  
Of man or worm; the vilest here excel me,  
They creep, yet see; I dark in light expos'd  
To daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,  
Within doors, or without, still as a fool,  
In power of others, never in my own;  
Scarce half I seem to live, dead more than half.

O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,  
Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse  
Without all hope of day!  
O first created beam, and thou great word,  
Let there be light, and light was over all;  
Why am I thus bereav'd thy prime decree?  
The sun to me is dark  
And silent as the moon,  
When she deserts the night  
Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.

Since light so necessary is to life,  
And almost life itself, if it be true  
That light is in the soul,  
She all in every part; why was the sight  
To such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd?  
So obvious and so easy to be quench'd,  
And not as feeling through all parts diffus'd,  
That she might look at will through every pore?  
Then had I not been thus exil'd from light;  
As in the land of darkness yet in light,  
To live a life half dead, a living death,  
And buried; but O yet more miserable!  
My self, my sepulchre, a moving grave,  
Buried, yet not exempt  
By privilege of death and burial  
From worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,  
But made hereby obnoxious more  
To all the miseries of life,  
Life in captivity  
Among inhuman foes.

But who are these? for with joint pace I hear  
The tread of many feet steering this way;  
Perhaps my enemies who come to stare  
At my affliction, and perhaps to insult,  
Their daily practice to afflict me more.

**Chor.** This, this is he; softly a while,  
Let us not break in upon him;  
O change beyond report, thought, or belief!  
See how he lies at random, carelessly diffus'd,  
With languish'd head unpropt,  
As one past hope, abandon'd  
And by himself given over;  
In slavish habit, ill-fitted weeds  
O'er worn and soiled;  
Or do my eyes misrepresent? Can this be he,  
That heroic, that renown'd,  
Irresistible Samson? whom unarm'd  
No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast could withstand;  
Who tore the lion, as the lion tears the kid,  
Ran on embattled armies clad in iron,  
And weaponless himself,  
Made arms ridiculous, useless the forgery  
Of brazen shield and spear, the hammer'd cuirass,  
Chalybean temper'd steel, and frock of mail  
Adamantine proof;  
But safest he who stood aloof,  
When insupportably his foot advanc'd,  
In scorn of their proud arms and warlike tools,  
Spurn'd them to death by troops. The bold Ascalonite  
Fled from his lion ramp; old warriors turn'd  
Their plated backs under his heel,  
Or grovelling soil'd their crested helmets in the dust.

Then with what trivial weapon came to hand,  
The jaw of a dead ass, his sword of bone,  
A thousand foreskins fell, the flower of Palestine  
In Ramath-lechi famous to this day:  
Then by main force pull'd up, and on his shoulders bore  
The gates of Gaza, post, and massy bar,  
Up to the hill by Hebron, seat of giants old,  
No journey of a Sabbath day, and loaded so;  
Like whom the Gentiles feign to bear up Heaven.

Which shall I first bewail,  
Thy bondage or lost sight,  
Prison within prison inseparably dark?  
Thou art become (O worst imprisonment!)  
The dungeon of thyself; thy soul  
(Which men enjoying sight oft without cause complain)  
Imprison'd now indeed,  
In real darkness of the body dwells,  
Shut up from outward light  
To incorporate with gloomy night;  
For inward light alas  
Puts forth no visual beam.

O mirror of our fickle state,  
Since man on earth unparallel'd!  
The rarer thy example stands,  
By how much from the top of wondrous glory,  
Strongest of mortal men,  
To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fall'n.  
For him I reckon not in high estate  
Whom long descent of birth  
Or the sphere of fortune raises;  
But thee whose strength, while virtue was her mate  
Might have subdu'd the earth,  
Universally crown'd with highest praises.

**Sam.** I hear the sound of words; their sense the air  
Dissolves unjoin'd ere it reach my ear.

**Chor.** He speaks, let us draw nigh. Matchless in might,  
The glory late of Israel, now the grief;  
We come thy friends and neighbours, not unknown  
From Eshtaol and Zorn's fruitful vale  
To visit or bewail thee, or, if better,  
Counsel or consolation we may bring,  
Salve to thy sores; apt words have power to swage  
The tumours of a troubl'd mind,  
And are as balm to fester'd wounds.

**Sam.** Your coming, friends, revives me; for I learn  
Now of my own experience, not by talk,  
How counterfeit a coin they are who friends  
Bear in their superscription (of the most  
I would be understood) in prosperous days  
They swarm, but in adverse withdraw their head  
Not to be found, though sought. Ye see, O friends,  
How many evils have enclos'd me round;  
Yet that which was the worst now least afflicts me,  
Blindness; for had I sight, confus'd with shame,  
How could I once look up, or heave the head,  
Who like a foolish pilot have shipwrack'd  
My vessel trusted to me from above,  
Gloriously rigg'd; and for a word, a tear,  
Fool, have divulg'd the secret gift of God  
To a deceitful woman: tell me, friends,  
Am I not sung and proverb'd for a fool  
In every street; do they not say, how well  
Are come upon him his deserts? yet why?  
Immeasurable strength they might behold  
In me, of wisdom nothing more than mean;  
This with the other, should at least have pair'd,  
These two proportion'd ill drove me transverse.

**Chor.** Tax not divine disposal; wisest men  
Have err'd, and by bad women been deceiv'd;  
And shall again, pretend they ne'er so wise.  
Deject not then so overmuch thyself,  
Who hast of sorrow thy full load besides;  
Yet truth to say, I oft have heard men wonder  
Why thou shouldst wed Philistian women rather  
Than of thine own tribe fairer, or as fair,  
At least of thy own nation, and as noble.

**Sam.** The first I saw at Timna, and she pleas'd me, not my parents, that I sought to wed, the daughter of an infidel: they knew not that what I motion'd was of God; I knew from intimate impulse, and therefore urg'd the marriage on; that by occasion hence I might begin Israel's deliverance, the work to which I was divinely call'd; she proving false, the next I took to wife (O that I never had! fond wish too late) was in the vale of Sorec, Dalila, that specious monster, my accomplish'd snare.

I thought it lawful from my former act, and the same end; still watching to oppress Israel's oppressors: of what now I suffer she was not the prime cause, but I myself, who vanquisht with a peal of words (O weakness!) gave up my fort of silence to a woman.

**Chor.** In seeking just occasion to provoke  
The Philistine, thy country's enemy,  
Thou never wast remiss, I bear thee witness:  
Yet Israel still serves with all his sons.

**Sam.** That fault I take not on me, but transfer  
On Israel's governors and heads of tribes,  
Who, seeing those great acts which God had done  
Singly by me against their conquerors,  
Acknowledg'd not, or not at all consider'd  
Deliverance offer'd: I on th' other side  
Us'd no ambition to commend my deeds,  
The deeds themselves, though mute, spoke loud the doer;  
But they persisted deaf, and would not seem  
To count them things worth notice, till at length  
Their lords the Philistines with gather'd powers  
Enter'd Judea seeking me, who then  
Safe to the rock of Etham was retir'd,  
Not flying, but fore-casting in what place  
To set upon them, what advantag'd best;  
Meanwhile the men of Judah to prevent  
The harrass of their land beset me round;  
I willingly on some conditions came  
Into their hands, and they as gladly yield me  
To the uncircumcis'd a welcome prey,  
Bound with two cords; but cords to me were threads  
Touch'd with the flame: on their whole host I flew  
Unarm'd, and with a trivial weapon fell'd  
Their choicest youth; they only liv'd who fled.  
Had Judah that day join'd, or one whole tribe,  
They had by this possess'd the towers of Gath,  
And lorded over them whom now they serve;  
But what more oft in nations grown corrupt,  
And by their vices brought to servitude,  
Then to love bondage more than liberty,  
Bondage with ease than strenuous liberty;  
And to despise, or envy, or suspect  
Whom God hath of his special favour rais'd  
As their deliverer; if he aught begin,  
How frequent to desert him, and, at last,  
To heap ingratitude on worthiest deeds?

**Chor.** Thy words to my remembrance bring  
How Succoth and the fort of Penuel  
Their great deliverer contemn'd,  
The matchless Gideon in pursuit  
Of Midian and her vanquisht kings:  
And how ingrateful Ephraim  
Had dealt with Jephtha, who by argument,  
Not worse than by his shield and spear  
Defended Israel from the Ammonite,  
Had not his prowess quell'd their pride  
In that sore battle when so many dy'd  
Without reprieve adjudg'd to death,  
For want of well pronouncing Shibboleth.

**Scitli?** Of such examples add me to the roll,  
Me easily indeed mine may neglect,  
But God's propos'd deliverance not so.

**Chor.** Just are the ways of God,  
And justifiable to men;  
Unless there be who think not God at all;  
If any be, they walk obscure;  
For of such doctrine never was there school,  
But the heart of the fool,  
And no man therein doctor but himself.

Yet more there be who doubt his ways not just,  
As to his own edicts found contradicting,  
Then give the reins to wandering thought,  
Regardless of his glories' diminution;  
Till by their own perplexities involv'd  
They ravel more, still less resolv'd,  
But never find self-satisfying solution.  
As if they would confine th' interminable,  
And tie him to his own prescript,  
Who made our laws to bind us, not himself,  
And hath full right to exempt  
Whom so it pleases him by choice  
From national obstruction, without taint  
Of sin, or legal debt;  
For with his own laws he can best dispense.

He would not else who never wanted means,  
Nor in respect of the enemy just cause  
To set his people free,  
Have prompted this heroic Nazarite,  
Against his vow of strictest purity,  
To seek in marriage that fallacious bride,  
Unclean, unchaste.

Down reason then, at least vain reasonings down,  
Though reason here aver  
That moral verdict quits her of unclean:  
Unchaste was subsequent, her stain not his.

But see, here comes thy reverend sire  
With careful step, locks white as down,  
Old Manoah: advise  
Forthwith how thou oughtst to receive him.

**Sam.** Ay me, another inward grief awak'd,  
With mention of that name renews th' assault.

**Man.** Brethren and men of Dan, for such ye seem,  
Though in this uncouth place; if old respect,  
As I suppose, towards your once-gloried friend,  
My son now captive, hither hath inform'd  
Your younger feet, while mine cast back with age  
Came lagging after; say if he be here.

**Chor.** As signal now in low dejected state,  
As erst in highest, behold him where he lies.

**Man.** O miserable change! is this the man,  
That invincible Samson, far renown'd,  
The dread of Israel's foes, who with a strength  
Equivalent to angels walk'd their streets,  
None offering fight; who single combatant  
Duell'd their armies rank'd in proud array,  
Himself an army, now unequal match  
To save himself against a coward arm'd  
At one spear's length. O ever failing trust  
In mortal strength! and oh what not in man  
Deceivable and vain! Nay what thing good  
Pray'd for, but often proves our woe, our bane?  
I pray'd for children, and thought barrenness  
In wedlock a reproach; I gain'd a son,  
And such a son as all men hail'd me happy;  
Who would be now a father in my stead?  
O wherefore did God grant me my request,  
And as a blessing with such pomp adorn'd?  
Why are his gifts desirable, to tempt  
Our earnest prayers, then giv'n with solemn hand  
As graces, draw a scorpion's tail behind?  
For this did the angel twice descend? for this  
Ordain'd thy nurture holy, as of a plant;  
Select, and sacred, glorious for a while,  
The miracle of men: then in an hour  
Ensnar'd, assaulted, overcome, led bound,  
Thy foes' derision, captive, poor, and blind  
Into a dungeon thrust, to work with slaves?  
Alas methinks whom God hath chosen once  
To worthiest deeds, if he through frailty err,  
He should not so o'erwhelm, and as a thrall  
Subject him to so foul indignities,  
Be it but for honours' sake of former deeds.

**Sam.** Appoint not heavenly disposition, Father;  
Nothing of all these evils hath befall'n me  
But justly; I myself have brought them on;  
Sole author I, sole cause: if aught seem vile,  
As vile hath been my folly, who have profan'd  
The mystery of God giv'n me under pledge  
Of vow, and have betray'd it to a woman,  
A Canaanite, my faithless enemy.

This well I knew, nor was at all surpris'd,  
But warn'd by oft experience: did not she  
Of Timna first betray me, and reveal  
The secret wrested from me in her height  
Of nuptial love profess'd, carrying it straight  
To them who had corrupted her, my spies,  
And rivals? In this other was there found  
More faith? who also in her prime of love,  
Spousal embraces, vitiated with gold,  
Though offer'd only, by the sent conceiv'd  
Her spurious first-born; treason against me?  
Thrice she assay'd with flattering prayers and sighs,  
And amorous reproaches to win from me  
My capital secret, in what part my strength  
Lay, stor'd, in what part summ'd, that she might know:  
Thrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport  
Her importunity, each time perceiving  
How openly, and with what impudence  
She purpos'd to betray me, and (which was worse  
Than undissembl'd hate) with what contempt  
She sought to make me traitor to myself;  
Yet the fourth time, when must'ring all her wiles,  
With blandish'd parley, feminine assaults,  
Tongue-batteries, she surceas'd not day nor night  
To storm me over-watch'd, and wearied out.  
At times when men seek most repose and rest,  
I yielded, and unlock'd her all my heart,  
Who with a grain of manhood well resolv'd  
Might easily have shook off all her snares:  
But foul effeminacy held me yok'd  
Her bond-slave; O indignity, O blot  
To honour and religion! servile mind  
Rewarded well with servile punishment!

The base degree to which I now am fall'n,  
These rags, this grinding, is not yet so base  
As was my former servitude, ignoble,  
Unmanly, ignominious, infamous,  
True slavery; and that blindness worse than this,  
That saw not how degenerately I serv'd.

**Man.** I cannot praise thy marriage choices, Son,  
Rather approv'd them not; but thou didst plead  
Divine impulsion prompting how thou might'st  
Find some occasion to infest our foes.

I state not that; this I am sure; our foes  
Found soon occasion thereby to make thee  
Their captive, and their triumph; thou the sooner  
Temptation found'st, or over-potent charms  
To violate the sacred trust of silence  
Deposited within thee; which to have kept  
Tacit was in thy power; true; and thou bear'st  
Enough, and more, the burden of that fault;  
Bitterly hast thou paid, and still art paying  
That rigid score. A worse thing yet remains,  
This day the Philistines a popular feast  
Here celebrate in Gaza, and proclaim  
Great pomp, and sacrifice, and praises loud  
To Dagon, as their god who hath deliver'd  
Thee, Samson, bound and blind into their hands,  
Them out of thine, who slew'st them many a slain.

So Dagon shall be magnifi'd, and God,  
Besides whom is no god, compar'd with idols,  
Disglorifi'd, blasphem'd, and had in scorn  
By th' idolatrous rout amidst their wine;  
Which to have come to pass by means of thee,  
Samson, of all thy sufferings think the heaviest,  
Of all reproach the most with shame that ever  
Could have befall'n thee and thy father's house.

**Sam.** Father, I do acknowledge and confess  
That I this honour, I this pomp have brought  
To Dagon, and advanc'd his praises high  
Among the heathen round; to God have brought  
Dishonour, obloquy, and open'd the mouths  
Of idolists and atheists; have brought scandal  
To Israel, diffidence of God, and doubt  
In feeble hearts, prone enough before  
To waver, or fall off and join with idols:  
Which is my chief affliction, shame and sorrow,  
The anguish of my soul, that suffers not  
Mine eye to harbour sleep, or thoughts to rest.

This only hope relieves me, that the strife  
With me hath end; all the contest is now  
'Twixt God and Dagon; Dagon hath presum'd,  
Me overthrown, to enter lists with God,  
His deity comparing and preferring  
Before the God of Abraham. He, be sure,  
Will not connive, or linger, thus provok'd,  
But will arise and his great name assert:  
Dagon must stoop, and shall ere long receive  
Such a discomfit as shall quite despoil him  
Of all these boasted trophies won on me,  
And with confusion blank his worshippers.

**Man.** With cause this hope relieves thee, and these words  
I as a prophecy receive: for God,  
Nothing more certain, will not long defer  
To vindicate the glory of his name  
Against all competition, nor will long  
Endure it doubtful whether God be Lord,  
Or Dagon. But for thee what shall be done?  
Thou must not in the meanwhile here forgot  
Lie in this miserable loathsome plight  
Neglected. I already have made way  
To some Philistian lords with whom to treat  
About thy ransom: well they may by this  
Have satisfied their utmost of revenge  
By pains and slaveries, worse than death inflicted  
On thee, who now no more canst do them harm.

**Sam.** Spare that proposal, Father, spare the trouble  
Of that solicitation; let me here,  
As I deserve, pay on my punishment;  
And expiate, if possible, my crime,  
Shameful garrulity. To have reveal'd  
Secrets of men, the secrets of a friend,  
How heinous had the fact been, how deserving  
Contempt and scorn of all, to be excluded  
All friendship, and avoided as a blab,  
The mark of fool set on his front?  
But I God's counsel have not kept, his holy secret  
Presumptuously have publish'd, impiously,  
Weakly at least, and shamefully: a sin

### Sam.
> Fair days have oft contracted wind and rain.

### Chor.
> But this another kind of tempest brings.

### Sam.
> Be less abstruse, my riddling days are past.

### Chor.
> Look now for no enchanting voice, nor fear  
> The bait of honied words; a rougher tongue  
> Draws hitherward, I know him by his stride,  
> The giant Harapha of Gath, his look  
> Haughty as is his pile high-built and proud.  
> Comes he in peace? what wind hath blown him hither  
> I less conjecture than when first I saw  
> The sumptuous Dalila floating this way:  
> His habit carries peace, his brow defiance.

### Sam.
> Or peace or not, alike to me he comes.

### Chor.
> His fraught we soon shall know, he now arrives.

### Har.
> I come not Samson, to condole thy chance,  
> As these perhaps, yet wish it had not been,  
> Though for no friendly intent. I am of Gath,  
> Men call me Harapha, of stock renown'd  
> As Og or Anak and the Emims old  
> That Kiriathaim held, thou know'st me now  
> If thou at all art known. Much I have heard  
> Of thy prodigious might and feats perform'd  
> Incredible to me, in this displeas'd,  
> That I was never present on the place  
> Of those encounters, where we might have tri'd  
> Each other's force in camp or listed field:  
> And now am come to see of whom such noise  
> Hath walk'd about, and each limb to survey,  
> If thy appearance answer loud report.

### Sam.
> The way to know were not to see but taste.

### Har.
> Dost thou already single me; I thought  
> Gis and the Mill had tam'd thee? O that fortune  
> Had brought me to the field where thou art fam'd  
> To have wrought such wonders with an asses' jaw;  
> I should have forc'd thee soon with other arms,  
> Or left thy carcass where the ass lay thrown:  
> So had the glory of prowess been recover'd  
> To Palestine, won by a Philistine  
> From the unforeskinn'd race, of whom thou bear'st  
> The highest name for valiant acts, that honour  
> Certain to have won by mortal duel from thee,  
> I lose, prevented by thy eyes put out.

### Sam.
> Boast not of what thou wouldst have done, but do  
> What then thou wouldst, thou seest it in thy hand.

### Har.
> To combat with a blind man I disdain,  
> And thou hast need much washing to be touch'd.

### Sam.
> Such usage as your honourable lords  
> Afford me—assassinated and betray'd,  
> Who durst not with their whole united powers  
> In fight withstand me single and unarm'd,  
> Nor in the house with chamber ambushes  
> Close-banded durst attaque me, no, not sleeping,  
> Till they had hir'd a woman with their gold  
> Breaking her marriage faith to circumvent me.  
> Therefore without feign'd shifts let be assign'd  
> Some narrow place enclos'd, where sight may give thee,  
> Or rather flight, no great advantage on me;  
> Then put on all thy gorgeous arms, thy helmet  
> And brigandine of brass, thy broad habergeon,  
> Vant-brass and greaves, and gauntlet, add thy spear,  
> A weaver's beam, and seven-times-folded shield,  
> I only with an oaken staff will meet thee,  
> And raise such out-cries on thy clatter'd iron,  
> Which long shall not withhold me from thy head,  
> That in a little time while breath remains thee,  
> Thou oft shalt wish thyself at Gath to boast.

# Samson Agonistes

> Again in safety what thou wouldst have done  
> To Samson, but shalt never see Gath more.

**Har.**  
> Thou durst not thus disparage glorious arms,  
> Which greatest Heroes have in battle worn,  
> Their ornament and safety; had not spells  
> And black enchantments, some magician's art  
> Arm'd thee, or charm'd thee strong, which, as thou feign'st,  
> From Heaven at thy birth was given thee in thy hair,  
> Where strength can least abide, though all thy hairs  
> Were bristles rang'd like those that ridge the back  
> Of chaf'd wild Boars, or ruffl'd Porcupines.

**Sam.**  
> I know no spells, use no forbidden arts;  
> My trust is in the living God who gave me  
> At my nativity this strength, diffus'd  
> No less through all my sinews, joints, and bones  
> Than thine, while I preserv'd these locks unshorn,  
> The pledge of my unviolated vow.

**Sam.**  
> For proof hereof, if Dagon be thy god,  
> Go to his temple, invocate his aid  
> With solemnest devotion; spread before him  
> How highly it concerns his glory now  
> To frustrate and dissolve these magic spells,  
> Which I to be the power of Israel's God avow,  
> And challenge Dagon to the test,  
> Offering to combat thee his champion bold  
> With th' utmost of his Godhead seconded:  
> Then thou shalt see, or rather to thy sorrow  
> Soon feel, whose God is strongest, thine or mine.

**Har.**  
> Presume not on thy God, what e'er he be;  
> Thee he regards not, owns not, hath cut off  
> Quite from his people, and delivered up  
> Into thy enemies' hand, permitted them  
> To put out both thine eyes, and fetter'd send thee  
> Into the common prison, there to grind  
> Among the slaves and asses thy comrades,  
> As good for nothing else, no better service  
> With those thy boisterous locks, no worthy match  
> For valour to assail, nor by the sword  
> Of noble warrior so to stain his honour,  
> But by the barber's razor best subdu'd.

**Sam.**  
> All these indignities, for such they are  
> From thine, these evils I deserve and more,  
> Acknowledge them from God inflicted on me,  
> Justly; yet despair not of his final pardon,  
> Whose ear is ever open, and his eye  
> Gracious to readmit the suppliant.  
> In confidence whereof I once again  
> Defy thee to the trial of mortal fight,  
> By combat to decide whose God is God,  
> Thine or whom I with Israel's sons adore.

**Har.**  
> Fair honour that thou dost thy God in trusting  
> He will accept thee to defend his cause,  
> A murderer, a revolter, and a robber!

**Sam.**  
> Tongue-doughty Giant, how dost thou prove me these?

**Har.**  
> Is not thy nation subject to our Lords?  
> Their magistrates confess'd it when they took thee  
> As a league-breaker, and deliver'd bound  
> Into our hands: for hadst thou not committed  
> Notorious murder on those thirty men  
> At Ascalon, who never did thee harm,  
> Then, like a robber, stripp'dst them of their robes?  
> The Philistines, when thou hadst broken the league,  
> Went up with armed powers thee only seeking,  
> To others did no violence nor spoil.

**Sam.**  
> Among the daughters of the Philistines  
> I chose a wife, which argu'd me no foe;  
> And in your city held my nuptial feast:  
> But your ill-meaning politician lords,  
> Under pretence of bridal friends and guests,  
> Appointed to await me thirty spies,  
> Who, threatening cruel death, constrain'd the bride  
> To wring from me and tell to them my secret,  
> That solv'd the riddle which I had propos'd.  
> When I perceiv'd all set on enmity,  
> As on my enemies, where e'er chanc'd,  
> I us'd hostility, and took their spoil  
> To pay my underminers in their coin.

> My nation was subjected to your lords.  
> It was the force of conquest; force with force  
> Is well repaid when the conquer'd can.  
> But I, a private person, whom my country  
> As a league-breaker gave up bound, presum'd  
> Single rebellion and did hostile acts.  
> I was no private but a person rais'd  
> With strength sufficient and command from Heaven  
> To free my country; if their servile minds,  
> Me their deliverer sent, would not receive,  
> But to their masters gave me up for nought,  
> Th' unworthier they; whence to this day they serve.  
> I was to do my part from Heaven assign'd,  
> And had perform'd it if my known offence  
> Had not disabl'd me, not all your force:  
> These shifts refuted, answer thy appellant,  
> Though by his blindness maim'd for high attempts,  
> Who now defies thee thrice to single fight,  
> As a petty enterprise of small enforce.

**Har.**  
> With thee a man condemn'd, a slave enroll'd,  
> Due by the law to capital punishment?  
> To fight with thee no man of arms will deign.

**Sam.**  
> Cam'st thou for this, vain boaster, to survey me,  
> To descant on my strength, and give thy verdict?  
> Come nearer, part not hence so slight inform'd;  
> But take good heed my hand survey not thee.

**Har.**  
> O Baal-zebub! can my ears unused  
> Hear these dishonours, and not render death?

**Sam.**  
> No man withholds thee, nothing from thy hand  
> Fear I incurable; bring up thy van;  
> My heels are fetter'd, but my fist is free.

**Har.**  
> This insolence other kind of answer fits.

**Sam.**  
> Go baffled coward, lest I run upon thee,  
> Though in these chains, bulk without spirit vast,  
> and with one buffet lay thy structure low,  
> Or swing thee in the air, then dash thee down  
> To the hazard of thy brains and shatter'd sides.

**Har.**  
> By Astaroth, e'er long thou shalt lament  
> These braveries in irons loaden on thee.

**Chor.**  
> His giantship is gone somewhat crestfall'n,  
> Stalking with less unconscionable strides,  
> And lower looks, but in a sultrie chafe.

**Sam.**  
> I dread him not, nor all his giant-brood,  
> Though Fame divulge him father of five sons,  
> All of gigantic size, Goliath chief.

**Chor.**  
> He will directly to the lords, I fear,  
> And with malicious counsel stir them up  
> Some way or other yet further to afflict thee.

**Sam.**  
> He must allege some cause, and offer'd fight  
> Will not dare mention, lest a question rise  
> Whether he durst accept the offer or not,  
> And that he durst not plain enough appear'd.  
> Much more affliction then already felt  
> They cannot well impose, nor I sustain;  
> If they intend advantage of my labours,  
> The work of many hands, which earns my keeping  
> With no small profit daily to my owners.  
> But come what will, my deadliest foe will prove  
> My speediest friend, by death to rid me hence,  
> The worst that he can give, to me the best.  
> Yet so it may fall out, because their end  
> Is hate, not help to me, it may with mine  
> Draw their own ruin who attempt the deed.

**Chor.**  
> Oh how comely it is and how reviving  
> To the spirits of just men long opprest!  
> When God into the hands of their deliverer  
> Puts invincible might  
> To quell the mighty of the earth, th' oppressor,  
> The brute and boisterous force of violent men,  
> Hardy and industrious to support  
> Tyrannic power, but raging to pursue  
> The righteous and all such as honour truth;  
> He all their ammunition  
> And feats of war defeats  
> With plain heroic magnitude of mind  
> And celestial vigour arm'd,  
> Their armories and magazines contemns,  
> Renders them useless, while  
> With winged expedition  
> Swift as the lightning glance he executes  
> His errand on the wicked, who surpris'd  
> Lose their defence distracted and amaz'd.

> But patience is more oft the exercise  
> Of saints, the trial of their fortitude,  
> Making them each his own deliverer,  
> And victor over all  
> That tyranny or fortune can inflict.  
> Either of these is in thy lot, Samson,  
> With might endu'd above the sons of men; but sight bereav'd  
> A low chance to number thee with those  
> Whom patience finally must crown.

> This idol's day hath been to thee no day of rest,  
> Labouring thy mind  
> More than the working day thy hands,  
> And yet perhaps more trouble is behind.

> For I descry this way  
> Some other tending; in his hand  
> A scepter or quaint staff he bears,  
> Comes on amain, speed in his look.  
> By his habit I discern him now  
> A public officer, and now at hand.  
> His message will be short and voluble.

**Off.**  
> Hebrews, the prisoner Samson here I seek.

**Chor.**  
> His manacles remark him; there he sits.

**Off.**  
> Samson, to thee our lords thus bid me say:  
> This day to Dagon is a solemn feast,  
> With sacrifices, triumph, pomp, and games;  
> Thy strength they know surpassing human rate,  
> And now some public proof thereof require  
> To honour this great feast, and great assembly;  
> Rise therefore with all speed, and come along,  
> Where I will see thee hearten'd and fresh-clad  
> To appear as fits before th' illustrious lords.

**Sam.**  
> Thou know'st I am a Hebrew; therefore tell them,  
> Our law forbids at their religious rites  
> My presence: for that cause I cannot come.

**Off.**  
> This answer, be assur'd, will not content them.

**Sam.**  
> Have they not sword-players, and ev'ry sort  
> Of gymnic artists, wrestlers, riders, runners,  
> Jugglers and dancers, antics, mummers, mimics;  
> But they must pick me out with shackles tir'd,  
> And over-labour'd at their public mill,  
> To make them sport with blind activity?  
> Do they not seek occasion of new quarrels  
> On my refusal to distress me more,  
> Or make a game of my calamities?  
> Return the way thou cam'st, I will not come.

**Off.**  
> Regard thyself; this will offend them highly.

**Sam.**  
> Myself? my conscience and internal peace.  
> Can they think me so broken, so debas'd  
> With corporal servitude, that my mind ever  
> Will condescend to such absurd commands?  
> Although their drudge, to be their fool or jester,  
> And in my midst of sorrow and heart-grief  
> To shew them feats, and play before their god,  
> The worst of all indignities, yet on me  
> Join'd with extreme contempt? I will not come.

**Off.**  
> My message was impos'd on me with speed,  
> Brooks no delay: is this thy resolution?

**Sam.**  
> So take it with what speed thy message needs.

**Off.**  
> I am sorry what this stoutness will produce.

**Sam.**  
> Perhaps thou shalt have cause to sorrow indeed.

**Chor.**  
> Consider, Samson; matters now are strain'd  
> Up to the height, whether to hold or break;  
> He's gone, and who knows how he may report  
> Thy words, by adding fuel to the flame?  
> Expect another message more imperious,  
> More lordly thund'ring than thou well wilt bear.

**Sam.**  
> Shall I abuse this consecrated gift  
> Of strength, again returning with my hair  
> After my great transgression, so requite  
> Favour renew'd, and add a greater sin  
> By prostituting holy things to idols;  
> A Nazarite in place abominable,  
> Vaunting my strength in honour to their Dagon?  
> Besides, how vile, contemptible, ridiculous,  
> What act more execrably unclean, profane?

**Chor.**  
> Yet with this strength thou serv'st the Philistines,  
> Idolatrous, uncircumcis'd, unclean.

**Sam.**  
> Not in their idol-worship, but by labour,  
> Honest and lawful, to deserve my food  
> Of those who have me in their civil power.

**Chor.**  
> Where the heart joins not, outward acts defile not.

**Sam.**  
> Where outward force constrains, the sentence holds;  
> But who constrains me to the temple of Dagon,  
> Not dragging? the Philistine lords command.

**Chor.**  
> Commands are no constraints.

**Sam.**  
> If I obey them,  
> I do it freely; venturing to displease  
> God for the fear of man, and man prefer,  
> Set God behind: which in his jealousy  
> Shall never, unrepented, find forgiveness.  
> Yet that he may dispense with me or thee  
> Present in temples at idolatrous rites  
> For some important cause, thou need'st not doubt.

**Chor.**  
> How thou wilt here come off surmounts my reach.

**Sam.**  
> Be of good courage; I begin to feel  
> Some rousing motions in me which dispose  
> To something extraordinary my thoughts.  
> I with this messenger will go along,  
> Nothing to do, be sure, that may dishonour  
> Our law, or stain my vow of Nazarite.  
> If there be aught of presage in the mind,  
> This day will be remarkable in my life  
> By some great act, or of my days the last.

**Chor.**  
> In time thou hast resolv'd; the man returns.

**Off.**  
> Samson, this second message from our lords  
> To thee I am bid say. Art thou our slave,  
> Our captive, at the public mill our drudge,  
> And dar'st thou at our sending and command  
> Dispute thy coming? come without delay;  
> Or we shall find such engines to assail  
> And hamper thee, as thou shalt come of force,  
> Though thou wert firmer fast'n'd than a rock.

**Sam.**  
> I could be well content to try their art,  
> Which to no few of them would prove pernicious.  
> Yet knowing their advantages too many,  
> Because they shall not trail me through their streets  
> Like a wild beast, I am content to go.  
> Masters' commands come with a power resistless  
> To such as owe them absolute subjection;  
> And for a life who will not change his purpose?  
> (So mutable are all the ways of men.)  
> Yet this be sure, in nothing to comply  
> Scandalous or forbidden in our law.

**Off.**  
> I praise thy resolution; doff these links:  
> By this compliance thou wilt win the lords  
> To favour, and perhaps to set thee free.

**Sam.**  
> Brethren, farewell; your company along  
> I will not wish, lest it perhaps offend them  
> To see me girt with friends; and how the sight  
> Of me, as of a common enemy,  
> So dreaded once, may now exasperate them,  
> I know not. Lords are lordliest in their wine;  
> And the well-feasted priest then soonest fired  
> With zeal, if aught religion seem concern'd:  
> No less the people on their holy-days,  
> Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable;  
> Happ'n what may, of me expect to hear  
> Nothing dishonourable, impure, unworthy  
> Our God, our law, my nation, or myself;  
> The last of me or no I cannot warrant.

**Chor.**  
> Go, and the Holy One  
> Of Israel be thy guide  
> To what may serve his glory best, and spread his name  
> Great among the heathen round:  
> Send thee the angel of thy birth, to stand  
> Fast by thy side, who from thy father's field  
> Rode up in flames after his message told  
> Of thy conception, and be now a shield  
> Of fire; that spirit that first rush'd on thee  
> In the camp of Dan  
> Be efficacious in thee now at need.

> For never was from Heaven imparted  
> Measure of strength so great to mortal seed,  
> As in thy wond'rous actions hath been seen.

**Chor.**  
> But wherefore comes old Manoa in such haste  
> With youthful steps? much livelier than e'er while  
> He seems: supposing here to find his son,  
> Or of him bringing to us some glad news?

**Man.**  
> Peace with you, brethren; my inducement hither  
> Was not at present here to find my son,  
> By order of the lords new parted hence  
> To come and play before them at their feast.  
> I heard all as I came; the city rings  
> And numbers thither flock; I had no will,  
> Lest I should see him forc'd to things unseemly.  
> But that which moved my coming now was chiefly  
> To give ye part with me what hope I have  
> With good success to work his liberty.

**Chor.**  
> That hope would much rejoice us to partake  
> With thee; say, reverend sire, we thirst to hear.

**Man.**  
> I have attempted one by one the lords,  
> Either at home, or through the high street passing,  
> With supplication prone and father's tears  
> To accept of ransom for my son their prisoner;  
> Some much averse I found and wondrous harsh,  
> Contemptuous, proud, set on revenge and spite;  
> That part most reverenc'd Dagon and his priests;  
> Others more moderate seeming, but their aim  
> Private reward, for which both God and state  
> They easily would set to sale; a third  
> More generous far and civil, who confess'd  
> They had enough reveng'd, having reduc'd  
> Their foe to misery beneath their fears,  
> The rest was magnanimity to remit,  
> If some convenient ransom were propos'd.

**Man.**  
> What noise or shout was that? it tore the sky.

**Chor.**  
> Doubtless the people shouting to behold  
> Their once great dread, captive, and blind before them,  
> Or at some proof of strength before them shown.

**Man.**  
> His ransom, if my whole inheritance  
> May compass it, shall willingly be paid  
> And numbered down: much rather I shall choose  
> To live the poorest in my tribe than richest,  
> And he in that calamitous prison left.  
> No, I am fix'd not to part hence without him.  
> For his redemption all my patrimony,  
> If need be, I am ready to forgo  
> And quit: not wanting him, I shall want nothing.

**Chor.**  
> Fathers are wont to lay up for their sons,  
> Thou for thy son art bent to lay out all;  
> Sons wont to nurse their parents in old age,  
> Thou in old age care'st how to nurse thy son,  
> Made older than thy age through eyesight lost.

**Man.**  
> It shall be my delight to tend his eyes,  
> And view him sitting in the house, enobl'd  
> With all those high exploits by him achiev'd,  
> And on his shoulders waving down those locks,  
> That of a nation arm'd the strength contain'd:  
> And I persuade me God had not permitted  
> His strength again to grow up with his hair,  
> Garrison'd round about him like a camp  
> Of faithful soldiery, were not his purpose  
> To use him further yet in some great service,  
> Not to sit idle with so great a gift,  
> Useless, and thence ridiculous about him.  
> And since his strength with eyesight was not lost,  
> God will restore him eyesight to his strength.

**Chor.**  
> Thy hopes are not ill founded nor seem vain  
> Of his delivery, and thy joy thereon  
> Conceiv'd, agreeable to a father's love,  
> In both which we, as next, participate.

**Man.**  
> I know your friendly minds and— O what noise!  
> Mercy of Heaven, what hideous noise was that!  
> Horribly loud, unlike the former shout.

**Chor.**  
> Noise call you it, or universal groan,  
> As if the whole inhabitation perish'd;  
> Blood, death, and deathful deeds are in that noise,  
> Ruin, destruction at the utmost point.

**Man.**  
> Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise;  
> Oh it continues, they have slain my son.

**Chor.**  
> Thy son is rather slaying them; that outcry  
> From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.

**Man.**  
> Some dismal accident it needs must be;  
> What shall we do, stay here or run and see?

**Chor.**  
> Best keep together here, lest running thither  
> We unawares run into danger's mouth.  
> This evil on the Philistines is fall'n;  
> From whom could else a general cry be heard?  
> The sufferers then will scarce molest us here,  
> From other hands we need not much to fear.  
> What if his eyesight (for to Israel's God  
> Nothing is hard) by miracle restor'd,  
> He now be dealing dole among his foes,  
> And over heaps of slaughter'd walk his way?

**Man.**  
> That were a joy presumptuous to be thought.

**Chor.**  
> Yet God hath wrought things as incredible  
> For his people of old; what hinders now?

**Man.**  
> He can, I know, but doubt to think he will;  
> Yet Hope would fain subscribe, and tempts belief.  
> A little stay will bring some notice hither.

**Chor.**  
> Of good or bad so great, of bad the sooner;  
> For evil news rides post, while good news baits.  
> And to our wish I see one hither speeding,  
> A Hebrew, as I guess, and of our tribe.

**Mess.**  
> O whither shall I run, or which way fly  
> The sight of this so horrid spectacle  
> Which erst my eyes beheld and yet behold;  
> For dire imagination still pursues me.  
> But providence, or instinct of nature seems,  
> Or reason, though disturb'd and scarce consultèd,  
> To have guided me aright, I know not how;  
> To thee first, reverend Manoa, and to these  
> My countrymen, whom here I knew remaining,  
> As at some distance from the place of horror,  
> So in the sad event too much concern'd.

**Man.**  
> The accident was loud, and here before thee  
> With rueful cry; yet what it was we hear not.  
> No preface needs; thou seest we long to know.

**Mess.**  
> It would burst forth, but I recover breath  
> And sense distract, to know well what I utter.

**Man.**  
> Tell us the sum; the circumstance defer.

**Mess.**  
> Gaza yet stands, but all her sons are fallen,  
> All in a moment overwhelm'd and fall'n.

**Man.**  
> Sad; but thou know'st to Israelites not saddest  
> The desolation of a hostile city.

**Mess.**  
> Feed on that first; there may in grief be surfeit.

**Man.**  
> Relate by whom.

**Mess.**  
> By Samson.

**Man.**  
> That still lessens  
> The sorrow, and converts it nigh to joy.

**Mess.**  
> Ah Manoa, I refrain, too suddenly  
> To utter what will come at last too soon;  
> Lest evil tidings with too rude irruption  
> Hitting thy aged ear should pierce too deep.

**Man.**  
> Suspense in news is torture; speak them out.

**Mess.**  
> Then take the worst in brief: Samson is dead.

**Man.**  
> The worst indeed; O all my hopes defeated  
> To free him hence! but death who sets all free  
> Hath paid his ransom now and full discharge.  
> What windy joy this day had I conceiv'd  
> Hopeful of his delivery, which now proves  
> Abortive as the first-born bloom of spring  
> Nipt with the lagging rear of winter's frost.  
> Yet e'er I give the reins to grief, say first,  
> How dy'd he? Death to life is crown or shame.  
> All by him fell thou say'st; by whom fell he?  
> What glorious hand gave Samson his death's wound?

**Mess.**  
> Unwounded of his enemies he fell.

**Man.**  
> Wearied with slaughter then, or how? explain.

**Mess.**  
> By his own hands.

**Man.**  
> Self-violence? what cause  
> Brought him so soon at variance with himself  
> Among his foes?

**Mess.**  
> Inevitable cause,  
> At once both to destroy and be destroy'd;  
> The edifice where all were met to see him  
> Upon their heads and on his own he pull'd.

**Man.**  
> O lastly over-strong against thyself!  
> A dreadful way thou took'st to thy revenge.  
> More than enough we know; but while things yet  
> Are in confusion, give us if thou canst,  
> Eye-witness of what first or last was done,  
> Relation more particular and distinct.

**Mess.**  
> Occasions drew me early to this city;  
> And as the gates I enter'd with sun-rise,  
> The morning trumpets, festival, proclaim'd  
> Through each high street: little I had dispatch'd,  
> When all abroad was rumour'd that this day  
> Samson should be brought forth to shew the people  
> Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games;  
> I sorrow'd at his captive state, but minded  
> Not to be absent at that spectacle.

> The building was a spacious theatre,  
> Half round, on two main pillars vaulted high,  
> With seats where all the lords and each degree  
> Of sort might sit in order to behold;  
> The other side was open, where the throng  
> On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand;  
> I among these aloof obscurely stood.  
> The feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice  
> Had fill'd their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,  
> When to their sports they turn'd. Immediately  
> Was Samson, as a public servant, brought,  
> In their state-livery clad; before him pipes  
> And timbrels, on each side went armed guards,  
> Both horse and foot before him and behind,  
> Archers and slingers, cataphracts and spears.  
> At sight of him the people with a shout  
> Rent the air, clamouring their god with praise,  
> Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.  
> He patient but undaunted where they led him,  
> Came to the place, and what was set before him,  
> Which without help of eye might be assay'd,  
> To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still perform'd  
> All with incredible, stupendous force,  
> None daring to appear antagonist.

> At length, for intermission's sake, they led him  
> Between the pillars; he his guide requested  
> (For so from such as nearer stood we heard)  
> As over-tired to let him lean a while  
> With both his arms on those two massy pillars  
> That to the arched roof gave main support.  
> He unsuspecting led him; which when Samson  
> Felt in his arms, with head a while enclin'd,  
> And eyes fast fixt, he stood, as one who pray'd,  
> Or some great matter in his mind revolv'd.  
> At last with head erect thus cried aloud,  
> Hitherto, lords, what your commands impos'd  
> I have perform'd, as reason was, obeying,  
> Not without wonder or delight beheld.  
> Now of my own accord such other trial  
> I mean to shew you of my strength, yet greater;  
> As with amaze shall strike all who behold.

> This utter'd, straining all his nerves he bow'd,  
> As with the force of winds and waters pent,  
> When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars  
> With horrible convulsion to and fro,  
> He tugg'd, he shook, till down they came and drew  
> The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder  
> Upon the heads of all who sate beneath,  
> Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,  
> Their choice nobility and flower, not only  
> Of this but each Philistine city round,  
> Met from all parts to solemnize this feast.  
> Samson, with these immix'd, inevitably  
> Pull'd down the same destruction on himself;  
> The vulgar only scap'd who stood without.

**Chor.**  
> O dearly-bought revenge, yet glorious!  
> Living or dying thou hast fulfill'd  
> The work for which thou wast foretold  
> To Israel, and now ly'st victorious  
> Among thy slain self-kill'd,  
> Not willingly, but tangled in the fold  
> Of dire necessity, whose law in death conjoin'd  
> Thee with thy slaughter'd foes in number more  
> Than all thy life had slain before.

**Semichor.**  
> While their hearts were jocund and sublime,  
> Drunk with idolatry, drunk with wine,  
> And fat regorg'd of bulls and goats,  
> Chaunting their idol, and preferring  
> Before our living dread who dwells  
> In Silo his bright sanctuary:  
> Among them he a spirit of phrenzy sent,  
> Who hurt their minds,  
> And urg'd them on with mad desire  
> To call in haste for their destroyer;  
> They only set on sport and play,  
> Unweetingly importun'd  
> Their own destruction to come speedy upon them.

> So fond are mortal men  
> Fall'n into wrath divine,  
> As their own ruin on themselves to invite,  
> Insensate left, or to sense reprobate,  
> And with blindness internal struck.

**Semichor.**  
> But he, though blind of sight,  
> Despis'd and thought extinguish'd quite,  
> With inward eyes illuminated  
> His fiery virtue rous'd  
> From under ashes into sudden flame;  
> And as an evening dragon came,  
> Assailant on the perched roosts,  
> And nests in order rang'd  
> Of tame villatic fowl; but as an eagle  
> His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.  
> So virtue giv'n for lost,  
> Depress'd, and overthrown, as seem'd,  
> Like that self-begot'n bird  
> In the Arabian woods emboss'd,  
> That no second knows nor third,  
> And lay ere while a holocaust;  
> From out her ashy womb now teem'd  
> Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most  
> When most unactive deem'd,  
> And though her body die, her fame survives,  
> A secular bird, ages of lives.

**Man.**  
> Come, come, no time for lamentation now,  
> Nor much more cause; Samson hath quit himself  
> Like Samson, and heroically hath finish'd  
> A life heroic: on his enemies  
> Fully reveng'd, hath left them years of mourning,  
> And lamentation to the sons of Caphtor  
> Through all Philistine bounds. To Israel  
> Honour hath left, and freedom, let but them  
> Find courage to lay hold on this occasion,  
> To himself and father's house eternal fame;  
> And which is best and happiest yet, all this  
> With God not parted from him, as was fear'd,  
> But favouring and assisting to the end.

> Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail  
> Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,  
> Dispraise, or blame, nothing but well and fair,  
> And what may quiet us in a death so noble.  
> Let us go find the body where it lies  
> Soak'd in his enemies' blood, and from the stream  
> With lavers pure and cleansing herbs wash off  
> The clotted gore. I, with what speed the while  
> (Gaza is not in plight to say us nay),  
> Will send for all my kindred, all my friends  
> To fetch him hence and solemnly attend  
> With silent obsequies and funeral train  
> Home to his father's house: there will I build him  
> A monument, and plant it round with shade  
> Of laurel ever green, and branching palm,  
> With all his trophies hung, and acts enroll'd  
> In copious legend, or sweet lyric song.  
> Thither shall all the valiant youth resort,  
> And from his memory inflame their breasts  
> To matchless valour, and adventures high.

> The Virgins also shall on feastful days
> 
> Visit his tomb with flowers, only bewailing
> 
> His lot unfortunate in nuptial choice,
> 
> From whence captivity and loss of eyes.
> 
> Chor. All is best, though we oft doubt,
> 
> What the unsearchable Disposer
> 
> Of highest wisdom brings about,
> 
> And ever best found in the close.
> 
> Oft he seems to hide his face,
> 
> But unexpectedly returns,
> 
> And to his faithful Champion hath in place
> 
> Bore witness gloriously; whence Gaza mourns
> 
> And all that band them to resist
> 
> His uncontrollable intent,
> 
> His servants he with new acquest
> 
> Of true experience from this great event
> 
> With peace and consolation hath dismissed,
> 
> And calm of mind, all passion spent.
