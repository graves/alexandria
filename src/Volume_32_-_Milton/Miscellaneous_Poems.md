## MISCELLANEOUS POEMS

### On the Morning of Christ's Nativity  
Compos'd 1629

I

This is the month, and this the happy morn  
Wherein the Son of Heav'ns eternal King,  
Of wedded maid and virgin mother born,  
Our great redemption from above did bring;  
For so the holy sages once did sing,  
That he our deadly forfeit should release,  
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.

II

That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,  
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,  
Wherwith he wont at Heav'ns high Counsel-table  
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,  
He laid aside; and here with us to be,  
Forsook the courts of everlasting Day,  
And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.

III

Say Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein  
Afford a present to the Infant God?  
Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,  
To welcome him to this his new abode,  
Now while the Heav'n by the Sun's team untrod,  
Hath took no print of the approaching light,  
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?

IV

See how from far upon the Eastern rode  
The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet;  
O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,  
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;  
Have thou the honour first, thy Lord to greet,  
And join thy voice unto the Angel Quire,  
From out his secret Altar touched with hallow'd fire.

### The Hymn

I

It was the Winter wilde,  
While the Heav'n-born-childe,  
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;  
Nature in awe to him  
Had doff'd her gawdy trim,  
With her great Master so to sympathize:  
It was no season then for her  
To wanton with the Sun her lusty paramour.

II

Only with speeches fair  
She woo'd the gentle Air  
To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,  
And on her naked shame,  
Pollute with sinful blame,  
The saintly veil of maiden white to throw,  
Confounded, that her Maker's eyes  
Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

III

But he her fears to cease,  
Sent down the meek-eyed Peace,  
She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding  
Down through the turning sphere  
His ready Harbinger,  
With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,  
And waving wide her myrtle wand,  
She strikes a universal Peace through Sea and Land.

IV

No war, or battails sound  
Was heard the world around,  
The idle spear and shield were high up hung;  
The hooked chariot stood  
Unstain'd with hostile blood,  
The trumpet spake not to the armed throng,  
And kings sate still with aweful eye,  
As if they surely knew their sovereign Lord was by.

V

But peacefull was the night  
Wherin the Prince of light  
His reign of peace upon the earth began:  
The winds with wonder whist,  
Smoothly the waters kist,  
Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,  
Who now hath quite forgot to rave,  
While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.

VI

The stars with deep amaze  
Stand fixt in stedfast gaze,  
Bending one way their precious influence,  
And will not take their flight,  
For all the morning light,  
Or Lucifer that oft' warned them thence;  
But in their glimmering orbs did glow,  
Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.

VII

And though the shady gloom  
Had given day her room,  
The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,  
And hid his head for shame,  
As his inferiour flame,  
The new enlight'ned world no more should need;  
He saw a greater Sun appear  
Then his bright throne, or burning axletree could bear.

VIII

The shepherds on the lawn,  
Or ere the point of dawn,  
Sate simply chatting in a rustick row;  
Full little thought they then,  
That the mighty Pan  
Was kindly come to live with them below;  
Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,  
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.

IX

When such musick sweet  
Their hearts and ears did greet,  
As never was by mortal finger strook,  
Divinely-warbled voice  
Answering the stringed noise,  
As all their souls in blissful rapture took:  
The Air such pleasure loth to lose,  
With thousand echos still prolongs each heav'nly close.

X

Nature that heard such sound  
Beneath the hollow round  
Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling,  
Now was almost won  
To think her part was done,  
And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;  
She knew such harmony alone  
Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union.

XI

At last surrounds their sight  
A globe of circular light,  
That with long beams the shame-fac'd night array'd,  
The helmed Cherubim  
And sworded Seraphim,  
Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,  
Harping in loud and solemn quire,  
With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir.

XII

Such Musick (as 'tis said)  
Before was never made,  
But when of old the sons of morning sung,  
While the Creator Great  
His constellations set,  
And the well-ballanc'd world on hinges hung,  
And cast the dark foundations deep,  
And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.

XIII

Ring out, ye crystall spheres,  
Once bless our human ears,  
(If ye have power to touch our senses so)  
And let your silver chime  
Move in melodious time;  
And let the base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow,  
And with your ninefold harmony  
Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony.

XIV

For if such holy Song  
Enwrap our fancy long,  
Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,  
And speckl'd vanity  
Will sicken soon and die,  
And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,  
And Hell itself will pass away,  
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.

XV

Yea Truth, and Justice then  
Will down return to men,  
Th'enamell'd Arras of the Rainbow wearing,  
And Mercy set between,  
Thron'd in Celestiall sheen,  
With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering,  
And Heav'n as at some festival,  
Will open wide the Gates of her high Palace Hall.

XVI

But wisest Fate saves no,  
This must not yet be so,  
The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy,  
That on the bitter cross  
Must redeem our loss;  
So both himself and us to glorifie:  
Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,  
The wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep.

XVII

With such a horrid clang  
As on mount Sinai rang  
While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake:  
The aged Earth agast  
With terror of that blast,  
Shall from the surface to the center shake,  
When at the worlds last session,  
The dreadful Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne.

XVIII

And then at last our bliss  
Full and perfect is,  
But now begins; for from this happy day  
Th'old Dragon under ground  
In straiter limits bound,  
Not half so far casts his usurped sway,  
And wrath to see his Kingdom fail,  
Swindges the scaly Horror of his folded tail.

XIX

The Oracles are dumb,  
No voice or hideous hum  
Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.  
Apollo from his shrine  
Can no more divine,  
With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.  
No nightly trance, or breathed spell,  
Inspires the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell.

XX

The lonely mountains o'er,  
And the resounding shore,  
A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;  
From haunted spring, and dale  
Edg'd with poplar pale,  
The parting Genius is with sighing sent,  
With flowre-inwoven tresses torn  
The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

XXI

In consecrated Earth,  
And on the holy Hearth,  
The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint,  
In Urns, and Altars round,  
A drear and dying sound  
Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint;  
And the chill Marble seems to sweat,  
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.

XXII

Peor, and Baalim,  
Forsake their Temples dim,  
With that twice-batter'd god of Palestine,  
And mooned Ashtaroth,  
Heav'n's Queen and Mother both,  
Now sits not girt with Tapers holy shine,  
The Libyan Hammon shrinks his horn,  
In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn.

XXIII

And sullen Moloch fled,  
Hath left in shadows dread,  
His burning Idol all of blackest hue,  
In vain with cymbals ring,  
They call the grisly king,  
In dismal dance about the furnace blue;  
The brutish gods of Nile as fast,  
Isis and Osiris, and the Dog Anubis haste.

XXIV

Nor is Osiris seen  
In Memphian Grove or Green,  
Trampling the unshower'd Grasse with lowings loud:  
Nor can he be at rest  
Within his sacred chest,  
Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud,  
In vain with Timbrel'd Anthems dark  
The sable-stoled Sorcerers bear his worshipt Ark.

XXV

He feels from Juda's Land  
The dreaded Infant's hand,  
The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;  
Nor all the gods beside,  
Longer dare abide,  
Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:  
Our Babe to shew his Godhead true,  
Can in his swadling bands control the damned crew.

XXVI

So when the Sun in bed,  
Curtain'd with cloudy red,  
Pillows his chin upon an Orient wave,  
The flocking shadows pale,  
Troop to th'infernal jail,  
Each fetter'd Ghost slips to his severall grave,  
And the yellow-skirted Fayes,  
Fly after the Night-steeds, leaving their Moon-lov'd maze.

XXVII

But see the Virgin blest,  
Hath laid her Babe to rest.  
Time is our tedious Song should here have ending,  
Heav'ns youngest teemed Star  
Hath fixt her polish'd Car,  
Her sleeping Lord with Handmaid Lamp attending:  
And all about the Courtly Stable,  
Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.

### A Paraphrase on Psalm 114

This and the following Psalm were done by the Author at fifteen years old.

When the blest seed of Terah's faithful Son,  
After long toil their liberty had won,  
And past from Pharian fields to Canaan land,  
Led by the strength of the Almighty's hand,  
Jehovah's wonders were in Israel shown,  
His praise and glory was in Israel known.

That saw the troubl'd sea, and shivering fled,  
And sought to hide his froth-becurled head,  
Low in the earth, Jordan's clear streams recoil,  
As a faint host that hath receiv'd the foil.

The high, huge-bellied mountains skip like rams  
Amongst their ewes, the little hills like lambs.

Why fled the ocean? And why skipt the mountains?  
Why turned Jordan toward his crystal fountains?  
Shake earth, and at the presence be aghast  
Of him that ever was, and ay shall last,  
That glassy floods from rugged rocks can crush,  
And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush.

### Psalm 136 (paraphrase)

Let us with a gladsome mind  
Praise the Lord, for he is kind,  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Let us blaze his Name abroad,  
For of gods he is the God;  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

O let us his praises tell,  
That doth the wrathful tyrants quell.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

That with his miracles doth make  
Amazed Heaven and Earth to shake.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

That by his wisdom did create  
The painted Heav'ns so full of state.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

That did the solid Earth ordain  
To rise above the watry plain.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

That by his all-commanding might  
Did fill the new-made world with light.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

And caus'd the Golden-tressed Sun,  
All the day long his course to run.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

The horned Moon to shine by night,  
Amongst her spangled sisters bright.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He with his thunder-clasping hand,  
Smote the first-born of Egypt land.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

And in despite of Pharaoh fell,  
He brought from thence his Israel.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

The ruddy waves he cleft in twain,  
Of the Ery three an main.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

The floods stood still like walls of glass,  
While the Hebrew bands did pass.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

But full soon they did devour  
The tawny King with all his power.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

His chosen people he did bless  
In the wastfull Wildernes.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

In bloody battail he brought down  
Kings of prowess and renown.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He foil'd bold Seon and his host,  
That rul'd the Amorrean coast.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

And large-lim'd Og he did subdue,  
With all his over hardy crew.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

And to his servant Israel,  
He gave their land therein to dwell.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He hath with a piteous eye  
Beheld us in our misery.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

And freed us from the slavery  
Of the invading enemy.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

All living creatures he doth feed,  
And with full hand supplies their need.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Let us therefore warble forth  
His mighty Majesty and worth.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

That his mansion hath on high  
Above the reach of mortall eye.  
For his mercies ay endure,  
Ever faithful, ever sure.

### The Passion

Ere-while of Musick, and Ethereal mirth,  
Wherwith the stage of Air and Earth did ring,  
And joyous news of heav'nly Infants birth,  
My muse with Angels did divide to sing;  
But headlong joy is ever on the wing,  
In Wintry solstice like the shortn'd light  
Soon swallow'd up in dark and long out-living night.

II

For now to sorrow must I tune my song,  
And set my Harp to notes of saddest woe,  
Which on our dearest Lord did seize ere long,  
Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse than so,  
Which he for us did freely undergo.  
Most perfect Hero, try'd in heaviest plight  
Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight.

III

He sov'ran Priest stooping his regall head  
That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,  
Poor fleshly tabernacle entered,  
His starry front low-roof'd beneath the skies;  
O what a Mask was there, what a disguise!  
Yet more; the stroke of death he must abide,  
Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethren's side.

IV

These latter scenes confine my roving verse,  
To this Horizon is my Phœbus bound,  
His Godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,  
And former sufferings other where are found;  
Loud o'er the rest Cremona's Trump doth sound;  
Me softer airs befit, and softer strings  
Of Lute, or Viol still, more apt for mournful things.

V

Befriend me night best Patroness of grief,  
Over the Pole thy thickest mantle throw,  
And work my flatter'd fancy to belief,  
That Heav'n and Earth are colour'd with my woe;  
My sorrows are too dark for day to know:  
The leaves should all be black whereon I write,  
And letters where my tears have wash'd a wanish white.

VI

See see the Chariot, and those rushing wheels,  
That whirl'd the Prophet up at Chebar flood,  
My spirit some transporting Cherub feels,  
To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,  
Once glorious Towers, now sunk in guiltless blood;  
There doth my soul in holy vision sit  
In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatic fit.

VII

Mine eye hath found that sad Sepulchral rock  
That was the Casket of Heav'ns richest store,  
And here though grief my feeble hands up-lock,  
Yet on the soften'd Quarry would I score  
My plaining verse as lively as before;  
For sure so well instructed are my tears,  
That they would fitly fall in order'd Characters.

VIII

Or should I thence hurried on viewless wing,  
Take up a weeping on the Mountains wilde,  
The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring  
Would soon unbosom all their Echoes mild,  
And I (for grief is easily beguiled)  
Might think th'infection of my sorrows loud  
Had got a race of mourners on some pregnant cloud.

Note: This subject the Author finding to be above the years he had when he wrote it, and nothing satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinish'd.

### On Time

Fly envious Time, till thou run out thy race,  
Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours,  
Whose speed is but the heavy Plummets pace;  
And glut thyself with what thy womb devours,  
Which is no more than what is false and vain,  
And merely mortal dross;  
So little is our loss,  
So little is thy gain.

For when as each thing bad thou hast entomb'd,  
And last of all, thy greedy self consum'd,  
Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss  
With an individual kiss;  
And Joy shall overtake us as a flood,  
When every thing that is sincerely good  
And perfectly divine,  
With Truth, and Peace, and Love shall ever shine  
About the supreme Throne  
Of him, to whose happy-making sight alone,  
When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall climb,  
Then all this earthy grossness quit,  
Attired with stars, we shall for ever sit,  
Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee O Time.

### Upon the Circumcision

Ye flaming Powers, and winged Warriors bright,  
That erst with Musick, and triumphant song  
First heard by happy watchful Shepherds ear,  
So sweetly sung your Joy the Clouds along  
Through the soft silence of the list'ning night;  
Now mourn, and if sad share with us to bear:  
Your fiery essence can distill no tear,  
Burn in your sighs, and borrow  
Seas wept from our deep sorrow,  
He who with all Heav'ns heraldry whileare  
Enter'd the world, now bleeds to give us ease;  
Alas, how soon our sin  
His Infancy to seize!  
O more exceeding love or law more just?  
Just law indeed, but more exceeding love!

For we by rightfull doom remedies  
Were lost in death, till he that dwelt above  
High thron'd in secret bliss, for us frail dust  
Emptied his glory, ev'n to nakedness;  
And that great Covenant which we still transgress  
Entirely satisfi'd,  
And the full wrath beside  
Of vengeful Justice bore for our excess,  
And seals obedience first with wounding smart  
This day, but O ere long  
Huge pangs and strong  
Will pierce more near his heart.

---

### At a Solemn Musick

Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'ns joy,  
Sphere-born harmonious Sisters, Voice and Verse,  
Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ  
Dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce,  
And to our high-rais'd phantasy present  
That undisturbed Song of pure content,  
Ay sung before the sapphire-colour'd throne  
To him that sits thereon  
With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubilee,  
Where the bright Seraphim in burning row  
Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow,  
And the Cherubick host in thousand quires  
Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires,  
With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms,  
Hymns devout and holy Psalms  
Singing everlastingly;

That we on Earth with undiscording voice  
May rightly answer that melodious noise;  
As once we did, till disproportion'd sin  
Jarr'd against nature's chime, and with harsh din  
Broke the fair musick that all creatures made  
To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd  
In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood  
In first obedience, and their state of good.

O may we soon again renew that Song,  
And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long  
To his celestial consort us unite,  
To live with him, and sing in endless morn of light.

### An Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester

This rich Marble doth entomb  
The honour'd Wife of Winchester,  
A Viscount's daughter, an Earl's heir,  
Besides what her virtues fair  
Added to her noble birth,  
More then she could own from Earth.

Summers three times eight save one  
She had told, alas too soon,  
After so short time of breath,  
To house with darkness, and with death.

Yet had the number of her days  
Been as compleat as was her praise,  
Nature and fate had had no strife  
In giving limit to her life.

Her high birth, and her graces sweet,  
Quickly found a lover meet;  
The Virgin quire for her request  
The God that sits at marriage feast;  
He at their invoking came  
But with a scarce-well-lighted flame;  
And in his Garland as he stood,  
Ye might discern a Cipress bud.

Once had the early Matrons run  
To greet her of a lovely son,  
And now with second hope she goes,  
And calls Lucina to her throws;  
But whether by mischance or blame  
Atropos for Lucina came;  
And with remorseless cruelty,  
Spoil'd at once both fruit and tree:

The hapless Babe before his birth  
Had burial, yet not laid in earth,  
And the languisht Mother's womb  
Was not long a living Tomb.

So have I seen some tender slip  
Sav'd with care from Winter's nip,  
The pride of her carnation train,  
Pluck't up by some unheedy swain,  
Who only thought to crop the flowr  
New shot up from vernal showr;  
But the fair blossom hangs the head  
Side-ways as on a dying bed,  
And those Pearls of dew she wears  
Prove to be presaging tears  
Which the sad morn had let fall  
On her hast'ning funerall.

Gentle Lady may thy grave  
Peace and quiet ever have;  
After this thy travail sore  
Sweet rest seize thee evermore,  
That to give the world increase,  
Shorten'd hast thy own life's lease;  
Here besides the sorrowing  
That thy noble House doth bring,  
Here be tears of perfect moan  
Wept for thee in Helicon,  
And some Flowers, and some Bays,  
For thy Hearse to strew the ways,  
Sent thee from the banks of Cam,  
Devoted to thy virtuous name;

Whilst thou bright Saint high sit'st in glory,  
Next her much like to thee in story,  
That fair Syrian Shepherdess,  
Who after years of barrenness,  
The highly favour'd Joseph bore  
To him that serv'd for her before,  
And at her next birth much like thee,  
Through pangs fled to felicity,  
Far within the bosom bright  
Of blazing Majesty and Light,  
There with thee, new welcom'd Saint,  
Like fortunes may her soul acquaint,  
With thee there clad in radiant sheen,  
No Marchioness, but now a Queen.

### Song on May Morning

Now the bright morning Star, Days harbinger,  
Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her  
The Flowry May, who from her green lap throws  
The yellow Cowslip, and the pale Primrose.

Hail bounteous May that dost inspire  
Mirth and youth, and warm desire,  
Woods and Groves, are of thy dressing,  
Hill and Dale, doth boast thy blessing.

Thus we salute thee with our early Song,  
And welcome thee, and wish thee long.

### On Shakespeare (1630)

What needs my Shakespear for his honour'd bones,  
The labour of an age in piled stones,  
Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid  
Under a Star-y pointing Pyramid?

Dear son of memory, great heir of Fame,  
What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?  
Thou in our wonder and astonishment  
Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.

For whilst to th' shame of slow-endeavouring art,  
Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart  
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalu'd Book  
Those Delphick lines with deep impression took,  
Then thou our fancy of itself bereaving,  
Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;  
And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,  
That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.

### On the University Carrier

(Who sickn'd in the time of his vacancy, being forbid to go to London by reason of the Plague)

Here lies old Hobson, Death hath broke his girt,  
And here, alas, hath laid him in the dirt,  
Or els the ways being foul, twenty to one,  
He's here stuck in a slough, and overthrown.

'Twas such a shifter, that if truth were known,  
Death was half glad when he had got him down;  
For he had any time this ten years full,  
Dodg'd with him, betwixt Cambridge and the Bull.

And surely, Death could never have prevail'd,  
Had not his weekly course of carriage fail'd;  
But lately finding him so long at home,  
And thinking now his journeys' end was come,  
And that he had tane up his latest Inn,  
In the kind office of a Chamberlin  
Shew'd him his room where he must lodge that night,  
Pull'd off his Boots, and took away the light:  
If any ask for him, it shall be said,  
Hobson has supt, and 's newly gon to bed.

---

### Another on the same

Here lieth one who did most truly prove,  
That he could never die while he could move,  
So hung his destiny never to rot  
While he might still jogg on, and keep his trot,  
Made of sphere-metal, never to decay  
Untill his revolution was at stay.

Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime  
'Gainst old truth) motion number'd out his time:  
And like an Engin mov'd with wheel and weight,  
His principles being ceast, he ended straight.

Rest that gives all men life, gave him his death,  
And too much breathing put him out of breath;  
Nor were it contradiction to affirm  
Too long vacation hastned on his term.

Merely to drive the time away he sickn'd,  
Fainted, and died, nor would with Ale be quickn'd;  
Nay, quoth he, on his swooning bed out-stretch'd,  
If I may not carry, sure lie ne'er be fetch'd;  
But vow though the cross Doctors all stood hearers,  
For one Carrier put down to make six bearers.

Ease was his chief disease, and to judge right,  
He di'd for heaviness that his Cart went light,  
His leisure told him that his time was com,  
And lack of load, made his life burdensom,  
That even to his last breath (there be that say't)  
As he were prest to death, he cry'd more weight;  
But had his doings lasted as they were,  
He had bin an immortall Carrier.

Obedient to the Moon he spent his date  
In course reciprocal, and had his fate  
Linkt to the mutual flowing of the Seas,  
Yet (strange to think) his wain was his increase:  
His Letters are deliver'd all and gon,  
Only remains this superscription.

### L'Allegro

Hence loathed Melancholy,  
Of Cerberus, and blackest midnight born,  
In Stygian Cave forlorn  
'Mongst horrid shapes, and shreiks, and sights unholy,  
Find out some uncouth cell,  
Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings,  
And the night-Raven sings;  
There under Ebon shades, and low-brow'd Rocks,  
As ragged as thy Locks,  
In dark Chmnerian desert ever dwell.

But come thou Goddess fair and free,  
In Heav'n ycleapt Euphrosyne,  
And by men, heart-easing Mirth,  
Whom lovely Venus at a birth  
With two sister Graces more  
To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;  
Or whether (as some Sager sing)  
The frolick Wind that breathes the Spring,  
Zephir with Aurora playing,  
As he met her once a Maying,  
There on Beds of Violets blew,  
And fresh-blown Roses wash'd in dew,  
Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair,  
So bounsome, blith, and debonair.

Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee  
Jest and youthful Jollity,  
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,  
Nods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles,  
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,  
And love to live in dimple sleek;  
Sport that wrincled Care derides,  
And Laughter holding both his sides.

Come, and trip it as ye go  
On the light fantastick toe,  
And in thy right hand lead with thee,  
The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty;  
And if I give thee honour due,  
Mirth, admit me of thy crue  
To live with her, and live with thee,  
In unreprov'd pleasures free;  
To hear the Lark begin his flight,  
And singing startle the dull night,  
From his watch-tower in the skies,  
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;

Then to come in spite of sorrow,  
And at my window bid good morrow,  
Through the Sweet-Briar, or the Vine,  
Or the twisted Eglantine.

While the Cock with lively din,  
Scatters the rear of darkness thin,  
And to the stack, or the Barn-dore,  
Stoutly struts his Dames before,  
Oft list'ning how the Hounds and horn  
Cheerly rouse the slumbring morn,  
From the side of some Hoar Hill,  
Through the high wood echoing shrill.

Some time walking not unseen  
By Hedge-row Elms, on Hillocks green,  
Right against the Eastern gate,  
Where the great Sun begins his state,  
Rob'd in flames, and Amber light,  
The clouds in thousand Liveries dight.  
While the Plowman near at hand,  
Whistles o'er the Furrow'd Land,  
And the Milkmaid singeth blithe,  
And the Mower whets his sithe,  
And every Shepherd tells his tale  
Under the Hawthorn in the dale.

Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures  
Whilst the Landscape round it measures,  
Russet Lawns, and Fallows Gray,  
Where the nibbling flocks do stray,

Mountains on whose barren breast
The labouring clouds do often rest:
Meadows trim with Daisies pied,
Shallow Brooks, and Rivers wide.
Towers, and Battlements it sees
Bosomed high in tufted Trees,
Where perhaps some beauty lies,
The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.
Hard by, a Cottage chimney smokes,
From betwixt two aged Oaks,
Where Corydon and Thyrsis met,
Are at their savoury dinner set
Of Herbs, and other Country Messes,
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;
And then in haste her bower she leaves,
With Thestylis to bind the Sheaves;
Or if the earlier season lead
To the tanned Haycock in the Mead,
Sometimes with secure delight
The up-land Hamlets will invite,
When the merry Bells ring round,
And the jocund rebecks sound
To many a youth, and many a maid,
Dancing in the Chequered shade;
And young and old come forth to play
On a Sunshine Holiday,
Till the livelong day-light fail,
Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,
With stories told of many a feat,
How Faery Mab the junkets ate,
She was pinched, and pulled she said,
And he by Friar's Lanthorn led
Tells how the drudging Goblin sweat,
To earn his cream-bowl duly set,
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,
His shadowy Flail hath threshed the Corn
That ten day-labourers could not end,
Then lies him down the Lubbar Fiend.
And stretched out all the chimney's length,
Basks at the fire his hairy strength;
And Crop-full out of doors he flings,
Ere the first Cock his matin rings.
Thus done the Tales, to bed they creep,
By whispering Winds soon lulled asleep.
Towered Cities please us then,
And the busy hum of men,
Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,
In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,
With store of Ladies, whose bright eyes
Rain influence, and judge the prize
Of Wit, or Arms, while both contend
To win her Grace, whom all commend.
There let Hymen oft appear
In saffron robe, with taper clear,
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,
With mask, and antique pageantry,
Such sights as youthful Poets dream
On Summer eves by haunted stream.
Then to the well-trod stage anon,
If Jonson's learned Sock be on,
Or sweetest Shakespeare's fancy's child,
Warble his native Wood-notes wild,
And ever against eating Cares,
Lap me in soft Lydian Airs,
Married to immortal verse
Such as the meeting soul may pierce
In notes, with many a winding bout
Of linked sweetness long drawn out,
With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,
The melting voice through mazes running;
Untwisting all the chains that tie
The hidden soul of harmony.

### Il Penseroso

That Orpheus' self may heave his head
From golden slumber on a bed
Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear
Such strains as would have won the ear
Of Pluto, to have quite set free
His half regained Eurydice.
These delights, if thou canst give,
Mirth with thee, I mean to live.

### Il Penseroso

Hence vain deluding joys,
The brood of folly without father bred,
How little you bestead,
Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys;
Dwell in some idle brain,
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,
As thick and numberless
As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams,
Or likest hovering dreams
The fickle Pensioners of Morpheus' train.
But hail thou Goddess, sage and holy,
Hail divinest Melancholy,
Whose saintly visage is too bright
To hit the Sense of human sight;
And therefore to our weaker view,
O'erlaid with black staid Wisdom's hue.
Black, but such as in esteem,
Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,
Or that starred Ethiope Queen that strove
To set her beauties praise above
The Sea-Nymphs, and their powers offended.
Yet thou art higher far descended,
Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore,
To solitary Saturn bore;
His daughter she (in Saturn's reign,
Such mixture was not held a stain)
Oft in glimmering bowers, and glades
He met her, and in secret shades
Of woody Ida's inmost grove,
While yet there was no fear of Jove.
Come pensive Nun, devout and pure,
Sober, steadfast, and demure,
All in a robe of darkest grain,
Flowing with majestic train,
And sable stole of cypress lawn,
Over thy decent shoulders drawn.
Come, but keep thy wonted state,
With even step, and musing gait,
And looks commercing with the skies,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:
There held in holy passion still,
Forget thyself to Marble, till
With a sad, leaden, downward cast,
Thou fix them on the earth as fast.
And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,
And hears the Muses in a ring,
Ay round about Jove's Altar sing.
And add to these retired Leisure,
That in trim Gardens takes his pleasure;
But first, and chiefest, with thee bring,
Him that yon soars on golden wing,
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,
The Cherub Contemplation,
And the mute Silence hist along,
'Less Philomel will deign a Song,
In her sweetest, saddest plight,
Smoothing the rugged brow of night,
While Cynthia checks her Dragon yoke,
Gently o'er th' accustomed Oak;
Sweet Bird that shun'st the noise of folly,
Most musical, most melancholy!
Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among,
I woo to hear thy even-Song;
And missing thee, I walk unseen
On the dry, smooth-shaven Green,
To behold the wandering Moon,
Riding near her highest noon,
Like one that had been led astray
Through the Heaven's wide pathless way;
And oft, as if her head she bowed,
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
Oft on a plat of rising ground,
I hear the far-off Curfew sound,
Over some wide-watered shore,
Swinging slow with sullen roar;
Or if the Air will not permit,
Some still removed place will fit,
Where glowing Embers through the room
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,
Far from all resort of mirth,
Save the Cricket on the hearth,
Or the Bellman's drowsy charm,
To bless the doors from nightly harm:
Or let my Lamp at midnight hour,
Be seen in some high lonely Tower,
Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,
With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere
The spirit of Plato to unfold
What Worlds, or what vast Regions hold
The immortal mind that hath forsook
Her mansion in this fleshly nook:
And of those Daemons that are found
In fire, air, flood, or underground,
Whose power hath a true consent
With Planet, or with Element.
Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy
In sceptered Pall come sweeping by,
Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,
Or the tale of Troy divine.
Or what (though rare) of later age,
Ennobled hath the buskined stage.
But, O sad Virgin, that thy power
Might raise Musaeus from his bower,
Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
Such notes as warbled to the string,
Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,
And made Hell grant what Love did seek.
Or call up him that left half told
The story of Cambuscan bold,
Of Camball, and of Algarsife,
And who had Canace to wife,
That owned the virtuous Ring and Glass,
And of the wondrous Horse of Brass,
On which the Tartar King did ride;
And if aught else, great Bards beside,
In sage and solemn tunes have sung,
Of Tourneys and of Trophies hung;
Of Forests, and enchantments drear,
Where more is meant than meets the ear.
Thus night oft see me in thy pale career,
Till civil-suited Morn appear,
Not tricked and frounced as she was wont,
With the Attic Boy to hunt,
But Cherchef't in a comely Cloud,
While rocking Winds are Piping loud,
Or ushered with a shower still,
When the gust hath blown his fill.
Ending on the rustling Leaves,
With minute drops from off the Eaves.
And when the Sun begins to fling
His flaring beams, me Goddess bring
To arched walks of twilight groves,
And shadows brown that Sylvan loves
Of Pine, or monumental Oak,
Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke,
Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,
Or fright them from their hallowed haunt.
There in close covert by some Brook,
Where no profaner eye may look,
Hide me from Day's garish eye,
While the Bee with honied thigh,
That at her flowery work doth sing,
And the Waters murmuring
With such consort as they keep,
Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep;
And let some strange mysterious dream,
Wave at his Wings in airy stream,
Of lively portraiture displayed,
Softly on my eyelids laid.
And as I wake, sweet music breathe
Above, about, or underneath,
Sent by some spirit to mortals good,
Or th' unseen Genius of the Wood.
But let my due feet never fail,
To walk the studious Cloisters pale,
And love the high embowed Roof,
With antique Pillars massy proof,
And storied Windows richly dight,
Casting a dim religious light.
There let the pealing Organ blow,
To the full-voiced Quire below,
In Service high, and Anthems clear,
As may with sweetness, through mine ear,
Dissolve me into ecstasies,
And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.
And may at last my weary age
Find out the peaceful hermitage,
The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell,
Where I may sit and rightly spell
Of every Star that Heaven doth show,
And every Herb that sips the dew;
Till old experience do attain
To something like prophetic strain.
These pleasures Melancholy give,
And I with thee will choose to live.

## Arcades

Part of an entertainment presented to the Countess Dowager of Derby at Harefield, by some noble persons of her Family, who appear on the Scene in pastoral habit, moving toward the seat of State with this Song.

### 1. SONG

Look Nymphs, and Shepherds look,
What sudden blaze of majesty
Is that which we from hence descry
Too divine to be mistook:
This, this is she
To whom our vows and wishes bend,
Here our solemn search hath end.
Fame that her high worth to raise,
Seemed erst so lavish and profuse,
We may justly now accuse
Of detraction from her praise,
Less then half we find exprest,
Envy bid conceal the rest.
Mark what radiant state she spreads,
In circle round her shining throne,
Shooting her beams like silver threads,
This, this is she alone,
Sitting like a Goddess bright,
In the center of her light.
Might she the wise Latona be,
Or the towered Cybele,
Mother of a hundred gods;
Juno dares not give her odds;
Who had thought this clime had held
A deity so unparalleled?

As they come forward, the Genius of the Wood appears, and turning toward them, speaks.

**Gen.** Stay gentle Swains, for though in this disguise,
I see bright honor sparkle through your eyes,
Of famous Arcady ye are, and sprung
Of that renowned flood, so often sung,
Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluice,
Stole under Seas to meet his Arethuse;
And ye the breathing Roses of the Wood,
Fair silver-buskined Nymphs as great and good,
I know this quest of yours, and free intent
Was all in honor and devotion meant
To the great Mistress of yon princely shrine,
Whom with low reverence I adore as mine,
And with all helpful service will comply
To further this night's glad solemnity;
And lead ye where ye may more near behold
What shallow-searching Fame hath left untold;
Which I full oft amidst these shades alone
Have sat to wonder at, and gaze upon:
For know by lot from Jove I am the power
Of this fair Wood, and live in oaken bower,
To nurse the Saplings tall, and curl the grove
With Ringlets quaint, and wanton windings wove.
And all my Plants I save from nightly ill,
Of noisome winds, and blasting vapors chill.
And from the Boughs brush off the evil dew,
And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blue,
Or what the cross dire-looking Planet smites,
Or hurtful Worm with cankered venom bites.
When Evening gray doth rise, I fetch my round
Over the mount, and all this hallowed ground,
And early ere the odorous breath of morn
Awakes the slumbering leaves, or tasseled horn
Shakes the high thicket, haste I all about,
Number my ranks, and visit every sprout
With puissant words, and murmurs made to bless,
But else in deep of night when drowsiness
Hath locked up mortal sense, then listen I
To the celestial Sirens' harmony,
That sit upon the nine enfolded Spheres,
And sing to those that hold the vital shears,
And turn the adamantine spindle round,
On which the fate of gods and men is wound.
Such sweet compulsion doth in music lie,
To lull the daughters of Necessity,
And keep unsteady Nature to her law,
And the low world in measured motion draw
After the heavenly tune, which none can hear
Of human mould with gross unpurged ear;
And yet such music worthiest were to blaze
The peerless height of her immortal praise,
Whose lustre leads us, and for her most fit,
If my inferior hand or voice could hit
Inimitable sounds, yet as we go,
Whate'er the skill of lesser gods can show,
I will assay, her worth to celebrate,
And so attend ye toward her glittering state;
Where ye may all that are of noble stem
Approach, and kiss her sacred vestures' hem.

### 2. SONG

O'er the smooth enamelled green
Where no print of step hath been,
Follow me as I sing,
And touch the warbled string.
Under the shady roof
Of branching Elm star-proof,
Follow me,
I will bring you where she sits
Clad in splendor as befits
Her deity.
Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia hath not seen.

### 3. SONG

Nymphs and Shepherds dance no more
By sandy Ladon's Lillied banks.
On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar,
Trip no more in twilight ranks,
Though Erymanth your loss deplore,
A better soil shall give ye thanks.
From the stony Maenalus,
Bring your Flocks, and live with us,
Here ye shall have greater grace,
To serve the Lady of this place.
Though Syrinx your Pan's Mistress were,
Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.
Such a rural Queen
All Arcadia hath not seen.

## Lycidas

In this Monody the Author bewails a learned Friend, unfortunately drowned in his Passage from Chester on the Irish Seas, 1637. And by occasion foretels the ruin of our corrupted Clergy then in their height.

Yet once more, O ye Laurels, and once more
Ye Myrtles brown, with Ivy never-sear,
I come to pluck your Berries harsh and crude,
And with forced fingers rude,
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,
Compels me to disturb your season due:
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.
He must not float upon his watery bier
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,
Without the meed of some melodious tear.
Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well,
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring,
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.
Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse,
So may some gentle Muse
With lucky words favor my destined Urn,
And as he passes turn,
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.
For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,
Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill.
Together both, ere the high Lawns appeared
Under the opening eyelids of the morn,
We drove afield, and both together heard
What time the Gray-fly winds her sultry horn,
Batting our flocks with the fresh dews of night,
Oft till the Star that rose, at Evening, bright
Toward Heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
Meanwhile the Rural ditties were not mute,
Tempered to th' Oaten Flute;
Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel,
From the glad sound would not be absent long,
And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.
But O the heavy change, now thou art gone,
Now thou art gone, and never must return!
Thee Shepherd, thee the Woods, and desert Caves,
With wild Thyme and the gadding Vine o'ergrown,
And all their echoes mourn.
The Willows, and the Hazel Copses green,
Shall now no more be seen,
Fanning their joyous Leaves to thy soft lays.
As killing as the Canker to the Rose,
Or Taint-worm to the weanling Herds that graze,
Or Frost to Flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,
When first the White thorn blows;
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds' ear.
Where were ye Nymphs when the remorseless deep
Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?
For neither were ye playing on the steep,
Where your old Bards, the famous Druids lie,
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream:
Ay me, I fondly dream!
Had ye been there— for what could that have done?
What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,
The Muse herself, for her enchanting son
Whom Universal nature did lament,
When by the rout that made the hideous roar,
His goary visage down the stream was sent,
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.
Alas! What boots it with unceasing care
To tend the homely slighted Shepherds' trade,
And strictly meditate the thankless Muse,
Were it not better done as others use,
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
(That last infirmity of Noble mind)
To scorn delights, and live laborious days;
But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
Comes the blind Fury with th' abhorred shears,
And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise,
Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears;
Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,
Nor in the glistering foil
Set off to th' world, nor in broad rumor lies,
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes,
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;
As he pronounces lastly on each deed,
Of so much fame in Heaven expect thy meed.
O Fountain Arethuse, and thou honored flood,
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,
That strain I heard was of a higher mood:
But now my Oat proceeds,
And listens to the Herald of the Sea
That came in Neptune's plea,
He asked the Waves, and asked the felon winds,
What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?
And questioned every gust of rugged wings
That blows from off each beaked Promontory,
They knew not of his story,
And sage Hippotades their answer brings,
That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed,
The Air was calm, and on the level brine,
Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.
It was that fatal and perfidious Bark
Built in th' eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
Next Camus, reverend Sire, went footing slow,
His Mantle hairy, and his Bonnet sedge,
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge
Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.
Ah! Who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?
Last came, and last did go,
The Pilot of the Galilean lake,
Two massy Keys he bore of metals twain,
(The Golden opes, the Iron shuts amain)
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake,
How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,
Enow of such as for their bellies' sake,
Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold?
Of other care they little reckoning make,
Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,
And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
A Sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least
That to the faithful Herdman's art belongs!
What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
And when they list, their lean and flashy songs
Grate on their scrannel Pipes of wretched straw,
The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed,
But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:
Besides what the grim Wolf with privy paw
Daily devours apace, and nothing said,
But that two-handed engine at the door,
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.
Return Alpheus, the dread voice is past,
That shrunk thy streams; Return Sicilian Muse,
And call the Vales, and bid them hither cast
Their Bells, and Flowrets of a thousand hues.
Ye valleys low where the mild whispers use,
Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,
On whose fresh lap the swart Star sparely looks,
Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes,
That on the green turf suck the honied showers,
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
Bring the rathe Primrose that forsaken dies,
The tufted Crow-toe, and pale Jessamine,
The white Pink, and the Pansy freaked with jet,
The glowing Violet.
The Musk-rose, and the well-attired Woodbine.
With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,
And Daffadillies fill their cups with tears,
To strew the Laureate Hearse where Lycid lies.
For so to interpose a little ease,
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.
Ay me! Whilst thee the shores, and sounding Seas
Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled,
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;
Or whether thou to our moist vows denied,
Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,
Where the great vision of the guarded Mount
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;
Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth.
And, O ye Dolphins, waft the hapless youth.
Weep no more, woful Shepherds, weep no more,
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor,
So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed,
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled Ore,
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,
Through the dear might of him that walked the waves,
Where other groves, and other streams along,
With Nectar pure his oozy Locks he laves,
And hears the unexpressive nuptial Song,
In the blest Kingdoms meek of joy and love.
There entertain him all the Saints above,
In solemn troops, and sweet Societies
That sing, and singing in their glory move,
And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
Now Lycidas the Shepherds weep no more;
Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good
To all that wander in that perilous flood.
Thus sang the uncouth Swain to th' Oaks and rills,
While the still morn went out with Sandals gray;
He touched the tender stops of various Quills,
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:
And now the Sun had stretched out all the hills,
And now was dropped into the Western bay;
At last he rose, and twitched his Mantle blue:
Tomorrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new.

1. Brother.
2. Brother.
Comus with his crew.
Sabrina the Nymph.

The chief persons which presented, were
The Lord Brackley,

The Lady Alice Egerton.

The first Scene discovers a wild Wood.
The attendant Spirit descends or enters.

BEFORE the starry threshold of Jove's Court
My mansion is, where those immortal shapes
Of bright aerial Spirits live insphered
In Regions mild of calm and serene Air,
Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot,
Which men call Earth, and with low-thoughted care
Confined, and pestered in this pin-fold here,
Strive to keep up a frail, and feverish being,
Unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives
After this mortal change, to her true Servants
Amongst the enthroned gods on Sainted seats.
Yet some there be that by due steps aspire
To lay their just hands on that Golden Key
That opes the Palace of Eternity:
To such my errand is, and but for such,
I would not soil these pure Ambrosial weeds,
With the rank vapors of this Sin-worn mould.
But to my task. Neptune, besides the sway
Of every salt Flood, and each ebbing Stream,
Took in by lot 'twixt high, and nether Jove,
Imperial rule of all the sea-girt Isles
That like to rich, and various gems inlay
The unadorned bosom of the Deep,
Which he to grace his tributary gods
By course commits to several government,
And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns,
And wield their little tridents, but this He
The greatest, and the best of all the main
He quarters to his blue-haired deities,
And all this tract that fronts the falling Sun
A noble Peer of mickle trust, and power
Has in his charge, with tempered awe to guide
An old, and haughty Nation proud in Arms:
Where his fair off-spring nursed in Princely lore,
Are coming to attend their Father's state,
And new-entrusted Scepter, but their way
Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear Wood,
The nodding horror of whose shady brows
Threats the forlorn and wandering Passenger.
And here their tender age might suffer peril,
But that by quick command from Sovereign Jove
I was dispatched for their defense, and guard;
And listen why, for I will tell ye now
What never yet was heard in Tale or Song
From old, or modern Bard in Hall, or Bower.
Bacchus that first from out the purple Grape,
Crushed the sweet poison of misused Wine,
After the Tuscan Mariners transformed,
Coasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,
On Circe's Isle fell (who knows not Circe,
The daughter of the Sun? Whose charmed Cup
Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape,
And downward fell into a groveling Swine)
This Nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks,
With Ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,
Had by him, ere he parted thence, a Son
Much like his Father, but his Mother more,
Whom therefore she brought up and Comus named,
Who ripe, and frolic of his full-grown age,
Roaming the Celtic, and Iberian fields,
At last betakes him to this ominous Wood,
And in thick shelter of black shades embowered,
Excels his Mother at her mighty Art,
Offering to every weary Traveler,
His orient liquor in a Crystal Glass,
To quench the drought of Phoebus, which as they taste
(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst)
Soon as the Potion works, their human countenance,
Th' express resemblance of the gods, is changed
Into some brutish form of Wolf, or Bear,
Or Ounce, or Tiger, Hog, or bearded Goat,
All other parts remaining as they were,
And they, so perfect is their misery,
Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,
But boast themselves more comely than before,
And all their friends, and native home forget
To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.
Therefore when any favored of high Jove,
Chances to pass through this adventurous glade,
Swift as the Sparkle of a glancing Star,
I shoot from Heaven to give him safe convoy,
As now I do: But first I must put off
These my sky robes spun out of Iris' Woof,
And take the Weeds and likeness of a Swain,
That to the service of this house belongs,
Who with his soft Pipe, and smooth-dittied Song,
Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar,
And hush the waving Woods, nor of less faith,
And in this office of his Mountain watch,
Likeliest, and nearest to the present aid
Of this occasion. But I hear the tread
Of hateful steps, I must be viewless now.

Comus enters with a Charming Rod in one hand, his Glass in the other, with him a rout of Monsters, headed like sundry sorts of wild Beasts, but otherwise like Men and Women, their Apparel glistening, they come in making a riotous and unruly noise, with Torches in their hands.

**Comus.** The Star that bids the Shepherd fold,
Now the top of Heaven doth hold,
And the gilded Car of Day,
His glowing Axle doth allay
In the steep Atlantic stream.

And the slope Sun his upward beam
Shoots against the dusky Pole,
Pacing toward the other goal
Of his Chamber in the East.
Meanwhile welcome Joy, and Feast,
Midnight shout, and revelry,
Tipsy dance, and Jollity.
Braid your Locks with rosy Twine
Dropping odours, dropping Wine.
Rigor now is gone to bed,
And Advice with scrupulous head,
Strict Age, and sour Severity,
With their grave Saws in slumber lie.
We that are of purer fire
Imitate the Starry Quire,
Who in their nightly watchful Spheres,
Lead in swift round the Months and Years.
The Sounds, and Seas with all their finny drove
Now to the Moon in wavering Morrice move,
And on the Tawny Sands and Shelves,
Trip the pert Fairies and the dapper Elves;
By dimpled Brook, and Fountain brim,
The Wood-Nymphs decked with Daisies trim,
Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:
What hath night to do with sleep?
Night hath better sweets to prove,
Venus now wakes, and wak'ns Love.
Come let us our rites begin,
'Tis only daylight that makes Sin
Which these dun shades will ne'er report.
Hail Goddess of Nocturnal sport
Dark-veiled *Cotytto*, t' whom the secret flame
Of midnight Torches burns; mysterious Dame
That ne'er art called, but when the Dragon womb
Of Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom,
And makes one blot of all the air,
Stay thy cloudy Ebon chair,
Wherein thou rid'st with *Hecate*, and befriend
Us thy vowed Priests, till utmost end
Of all thy dues be done, and none left out,
Ere the blabbing Eastern scout,
The nice Morn on th' Indian steep
From her cabin'd loophole peep,
And to the tell-tale Sun descry
Our concealed Solemnity.
Come, knit hands, and beat the ground,
In a light fantastic round.

### The Measure

Break off, break off, I feel the different pace,
Of some chaste footing near about this ground.
Run to your shrouds, within these Brakes and Trees,
Our number may affright: Some Virgin sure
(For so I can distinguish by mine Art)
Benighted in these Woods. Now to my charms,
And to my wily trains, I shall ere long
Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
About my Mother *Circe*. Thus I hurl
My dazzling Spells into the spongy air,
Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,
And give it false presentments, lest the place
And my quaint habits breed astonishment,
And put the Damsel to suspicious flight,
Which must not be, for that's against my course;
I under fair pretence of friendly ends,
And well-placed words of glozing courtesy
Baited with reasons not unplausible
Wind me into the easy-hearted man,
And hug him into snares. When once her eye
Hath met the virtue of this Magic dust,
I shall appear some harmless Villager
Whom thrift keeps up about his Country gear,
But here she comes, I fairly step aside,
And hearken, if I may, her business here.

### The Lady enters

This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,
My best guide now, methought it was the sound
Of Riot, and ill-managed Merriment,
Such as the jocund Flute, or gamesome Pipe
Stirs up among the loose unlettered Hinds,
When for their teeming Flocks, and granges full
In wanton dance they praise the bounteous *Pan*,
And thank the gods amiss. I should be loath
To meet the rudeness, and swilled insolence
Of such late Wassailers; yet O where else
Shall I inform my unacquainted feet
In the blind mazes of this tangled Wood?
My Brothers when they saw me wearied out
With this long way, resolving here to lodge
Under the spreading favour of these Pines,
Stepped as they seemed to the next Thicket side
To bring me Berries, or such cooling fruit
As the kind hospitable Woods provide.
They left me then, when the gray-hooded Even
Like a sad Votarist in Palmer's weed
Rose from the hindmost wheels of *Phoebus'* wain.
But where they are, and why they came not back,
Is now the labour of my thoughts, 'tis likeliest
They had engaged their wandering steps too far,
And envious darkness, ere they could return,
Had stolen them from me, else O thievish Night
Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,
In thy dark lantern thus close up the Stars,
That nature hung in Heaven, and filled their Lamps
With everlasting oil, to give due light
To the misled and lonely Traveller?
This is the place, as well as I may guess,
Whence even now the tumult of loud Mirth
Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear,
Yet nought but single darkness do I find.
What might this be? A thousand fantasies
Begin to throng into my memory
Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,
And airy tongues, that syllable men's names
On Sands, and Shores, and desert Wildernesses.
These thoughts may startle well, but not astound
The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended
By a strong siding champion Conscience.
O welcome pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,
Thou hovering Angel girt with golden wings,
And thou unblemished form of Chastity,
I see ye visibly, and now believe
That he, the Supreme good, t' whom all things ill
Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,
Would send a glistening Guardian if need were
To keep my life and honour unassailed.
Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud
Turn forth her silver lining on the night?
I did not err, there does a sable cloud
Turn forth her silver lining on the night,
And casts a gleam over this tufted Grove.
I cannot halloo to my Brothers, but
Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest
I'll venture, for my new enlivened spirits
Prompt me; and they perhaps are not far off.

### SONG

Sweet *Echo*, sweetest Nymph that liv'st unseen
Within thy airy shell
By slow *Meander's* margent green,
And in the violet embroidered vale
Where the love-lorn Nightingale
Nightly to thee her sad Song mourneth well.
Canst thou not tell me of a gentle Pair
That likest thy *Narcissus* are?
O if thou have
Hid them in some flowery Cave,
Tell me but where
Sweet Queen of Parly, Daughter of the Sphere,
So mayst thou be translated to the skies,
And give resounding grace to all Heaven's Harmonies.

**Com.** Can any mortal mixture of Earth's mould
Breathe such Divine enchanting ravishment?
Sure something holy lodges in that breast,
And with these raptures moves the vocal air
To testify his hidden residence;
How sweetly did they float upon the wings
Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night
At every fall smoothing the Raven down
Of darkness till it smiled: I have oft heard
My mother *Circe* with the *Sirens* three,
Amidst the flowery-girded *Naiades*
Culling their Potent herbs, and baleful drugs,
Who as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,
And lap it in *Elysium*, *Scylla* wept,
And chid her barking waves into attention,
And fell *Charybdis* murmured soft applause:
Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,
And in sweet madness robbed it of itself,
But such a sacred, and home-felt delight,
Such sober certainty of waking bliss
I never heard till now. I'll speak to her
And she shall be my Queen. Hail foreign wonder
Whom certain these rough shades did never breed
Unless the Goddess that in rural shrine
Dwell'st here with *Pan*, or *Silvan*, by blest Song
Forbidding every bleak unkindly Fog
To touch the prosperous growth of this tall Wood.

**La.** Nay, gentle Shepherd, ill is lost that praise
That is addressed to unattending Ears,
Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift
How to regain my severed company
Compelled me to awake the courteous *Echo*
To give me answer from her mossy Couch.

**Co.** What chance, good Lady, hath bereft you thus?

**La.** Dim darkness, and this leafy Labyrinth.

**Co.** Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?

**La.** They left me weary on a grassy turf.

**Co.** By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why?

**La.** To seek i'th valley some cool friendly Spring.

**Co.** And left your fair side all unguarded, Lady?

**La.** They were but twain, and purposed quick return.

**Co.** Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.

**La.** How easy my misfortune is to hit!

**Co.** Imports their loss, beside the present need?

**La.** No less than if I should my brothers lose.

**Co.** Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?

**La.** As smooth as *Hebe's* their unrazored lips.

**Co.** Two such I saw, what time the laboured Ox
In his loose traces from the furrow came,
And the swinked hedger at his Supper sat;
I saw them under a green mantling vine
That crawls along the side of yon small hill,
Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots,
Their port was more than human, as they stood;
I took it for a faery vision
Of some gay creatures of the element
That in the colours of the Rainbow live
And play i'th plighted clouds. I was awestruck,
And as I passed, I worshipped: if those you seek
It were a journey like the path to Heaven,
To help you find them.

**La.** Gentle Villager,
What readiest way would bring me to that place?

**Co.** Due west it rises from this shrubby point.

**La.** To find out that, good Shepherd, I suppose,
In such a scant allowance of Starlight,
Would overtask the best Land-Pilot's art,
Without the sure guess of well-practiced feet.

**Co.** I know each lane, and every alley green
Dingle, or bushy dell of this wild Wood,
And every bosky bourn from side to side
My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood,
And if your stray attendance be yet lodged,
Or shroud within these limits, I shall know
Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark
From her thatched pallet rouse, if otherwise
I can conduct you, Lady, to a low
But loyal cottage, where you may be safe
Till further quest.

**La.** Shepherd, I take thy word,
And trust thy honest offered courtesy,
Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds
With smoky rafters, than in tapestry Halls
And Courts of Princes, where it first was named,
And yet is most pretended: In a place
Less warranted than this, or less secure
I cannot be, that I should fear to change it.
Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial
To my proportioned strength. Shepherd, lead on.

### The Two Brothers

**Eld. Bro.** Unmuffle, ye faint stars, and thou fair Moon,
That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,
Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,
And disinherit *Chaos*, that reigns here
In double night of darkness, and of shades;
Or if your influence be quite damned up
With black usurping mists, some gentle taper
Though a rush Candle from the wicker hole
Of some clay habitation visit us
With thy long-levelled rule of streaming light,
And thou shalt be our star of *Arcady*,
Or Tyrian *Cynosure*.

**2. Bro.** Or if our eyes
Be barred that happiness, might we but hear
The folded flocks penned in their wattled cotes,
Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,
Or whistle from the Lodge, or village cock
Count the night watches to his feathery Dames,
'Twould be some solace yet, some little cheering
In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.
But O that hapless virgin our lost sister
Where may she wander now, whither betake her
From the chill dew, amongst rude burrs and thistles?
Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now
Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad Elm
Leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears.
What if in wild amazement, and affright,
Or while we speak within the direful grasp
Of Savage hunger, or of Savage heat?

**Eld. Bro.** Peace, brother, be not over-exquisite
To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;
For grant they be so, while they rest unknown,
What need a man forestall his date of grief,
And run to meet what he would most avoid?
Or if they be but false alarms of Fear,
How bitter is such self-delusion?
I do not think my sister so to seek,
Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,
And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,
As that the single want of light and noise
(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)
Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,
And put them into misbecoming plight.
Virtue could see to do what virtue would
By her own radiant light, though Sun and Moon
Were in the flat Sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
Oft seeks to sweet retired Solitude,
Where with her best nurse Contemplation
She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings
That in the various bustle of resort
Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impaired.
He that has light within his own clear breast
May sit i'th center, and enjoy bright day,
But he that hides a dark soul, and foul thoughts
Benighted walks under the midday Sun;
Himself is his own dungeon.

**2. Bro.** 'Tis most true
That musing meditation most affects
The pensive secrecy of desert cell,
Far from the cheerful haunt of men, and herds,
And sits as safe as in a Senate house,
For who would rob a Hermit of his Weeds,
His few Books, or his Beads, or Maple Dish,
Or do his gray hairs any violence?
But beauty like the fair *Hesperian* Tree
Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard
Of dragon watch with unenchanted eye,
To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit
From the rash hand of bold Incontinence.
You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
Of Misers' treasure by an outlaw's den,
And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope
Danger will wink on Opportunity,
And let a single helpless maiden pass
Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.
Of night, or loneliness it recks me not,
I fear the dread events that dog them both,
Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person
Of our unowned sister.

**Eld. Bro.** I do not, brother,
Infer, as if I thought my sister's state
Secure without all doubt, or controversy:
Yet where an equal poise of hope and fear
Does arbitrate th' event, my nature is
That I incline to hope, rather than fear,
And gladly banish squint suspicion.
My sister is not so defenceless left
As you imagine, she has a hidden strength
Which you remember not.

**2. Bro.** What hidden strength,
Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that?

**Eld. Bro.** I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength
Which if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own:
'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity:
She that has that, is clad in complete steel,
And like a quivered Nymph with Arrows keen
May trace huge Forests, and unharboured Heaths,
Infamous Hills, and sandy perilous wilds,
Where through the sacred rays of Chastity,
No savage fierce, Bandit, or mountaineer
Will dare to soil her Virgin purity,
Yea there, where very desolation dwells
By grots, and caverns shagged with horrid shades,
She may pass on with unblenched majesty,
Be it not done in pride, or in presumption.
Some say no evil thing that walks by night
In fog, or fire, by lake, or moorish fen,
Blue meager Hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,
That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,
No goblin, or swart faery of the mine,
Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.
Do ye believe me yet, or shall I call
Antiquity from the old Schools of Greece
To testify the arms of Chastity?
Hence had the huntress *Dian* her dread bow
Fair silver-shafted Queen for ever chaste,
Wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
And spotted mountain pard, but set at nought
The frivolous bolt of *Cupid*, gods and men
Feared her stern frown, and she was queen o'th' Woods.
What was that snaky-headed *Gorgon* shield
That wise *Minerva* wore, unconquered Virgin,
Wherewith she froze her foes to congealed stone?
But rigid looks of chaste austerity,
And noble grace that dashed brute violence
With sudden adoration, and blank awe.
So dear to Heaven is Saintly chastity,
That when a soul is found sincerely so,
A thousand liveried Angels lackey her,
Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
And in clear dream, and solemn vision
Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear,
Till oft converse with heavenly habitants
Begin to cast a beam on th' outward shape,
The unpolluted temple of the mind,
And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,
Till all be made immortal: but when lust
By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,
But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,
Lets in defilement to the inward parts,
The soul grows clotted by contagion,
Embodies, and embrutes, till she quite lose
The divine property of her first being.
Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp
Oft seen in charnel vaults, and sepulchers
Lingering, and sitting by a new-made grave,
As loath to leave the body that it loved,
And linked itself by carnal sensuality
To a degenerate and degraded state.

**2. Bro.** How charming is divine Philosophy!
Not harsh, and crabbed as dull fools suppose,
But musical as is *Apollo's* lute,
And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,
Where no crude surfeit reigns.

**Eld. Bro.** List, list, I hear
Some far-off halloo break the silent Air.

**2. Bro.** Methought so too; what should it be?

**Eld. Bro.** For certain,
Either some one like us night-foundered here,
Or else some neighbour Woodman, or at worst,
Some roving Robber calling to his fellows.

**2. Bro.** Heaven keep my sister, again, again, and near,
Best draw, and stand upon our guard.

**Eld. Bro.** I'll halloo,
If he be friendly he comes well, if not,
Defence is a good cause, and Heaven be for us.

### The attendant Spirit habited like a Shepherd

That halloo I should know, what are you? Speak;
Come not too near, you fall on iron stakes else.

**Spir.** What voice is that, my young Lord? Speak again.

**2. Bro.** O brother, 'tis my father's Shepherd sure.

**Eld. Bro.** *Thyrsis*? Whose artful strains have oft delayed
The huddling brook to hear his madrigal,
And sweetened every muskrose of the dale,
How cam'st thou here, good Swain? Hath any ram
Slipped from the fold, or young Kid lost his dam,
Or straggling wether the penned flock forsook?
How couldst thou find this dark sequestered nook?

**Spir.** O my loved master's heir, and his next joy,
I came not here on such a trivial toy
As a strayed Ewe, or to pursue the stealth
Of pilfering Wolf, not all the fleecy wealth
That doth enrich these Downs, is worth a thought
To this my errand, and the care it brought.
But O my Virgin Lady, where is she?
How chance she is not in your company?

**Eld. Bro.** To tell thee sadly, Shepherd, without blame,
Or our neglect, we lost her as we came.

**Spir.** Ay me, unhappy, then my fears are true.

**Eld. Bro.** What fears, good *Thyrsis*? Prithee briefly show.

**Spir.** I'll tell ye, 'tis not vain or fabulous,
(Though so esteemed by shallow ignorance)
What the sage Poets taught by th' heavenly Muse,
Storied of old in high immortal verse
Of dire *Chimeras* and enchanted lies,
And rifted Rocks whose entrance leads to hell,
For such there be, but unbelief is blind.
Within the navel of this hideous Wood,
Immured in cypress shades a Sorcerer dwells
Of *Bacchus*, and of *Circe* born, great *Comus*,
Deep skilled in all his mother's witcheries,
And here to every thirsty wanderer,
By sly enticement gives his baneful cup,
With many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison
The visage quite transforms of him that drinks,
And the inglorious likeness of a beast
Fixes instead, unmoulding reason's mintage
Charactered in the face; this have I learned
Tending my flocks hard by i'th hilly crofts,
That brow this bottom glade, whence night by night
He and his monstrous rout are heard to howl
Like stabled wolves, or tigers at their prey,
Doing abhorred rites to *Hecate*
In their obscured haunts of inmost bowers.
Yet have they many baits, and guileful spells
To inveigle and invite th' unwary sense
Of them that pass unweeting by the way.
This evening late, by then the chewing flocks
Had ta'en their supper on the savoury Herb
Of Knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,
I sat me down to watch upon a bank
With Ivy canopied, and interwove
With flaunting Honeysuckle, and began
Wrapped in a pleasing fit of melancholy
To meditate my rural minstrelsy,
Till fancy had her fill, but ere a close
The wonted roar was up amidst the Woods,
And filled the Air with barbarous dissonance,
At which I ceased, and listened them a while,
Till an unusual stop of sudden silence
Gave respite to the drowsy frighted steeds
That draw the litter of close-curtained sleep.
At last a soft and solemn breathing sound
Rose like a steam of rich distilled Perfumes,
And stole upon the Air, that even Silence
Was took ere she was ware, and wished she might
Deny her nature, and be never more
Still to be so displaced. I was all ear,
And took in strains that might create a soul
Under the ribs of Death, but O ere long
Too well I did perceive it was the voice
Of my most honoured Lady, your dear sister.
Amazed I stood, harrowed with grief and fear,
And O poor hapless Nightingale, thought I,
How sweet thou sing'st, how near the deadly snare!
Then down the Lawns I ran with headlong haste
Through paths, and turnings often trod by day,
Till guided by mine ear I found the place
Where that damned wizard hid in sly disguise
(For so by certain signs I knew) had met
Already, ere my best speed could prevent,
The aidless innocent Lady his wished prey,
Who gently asked if he had seen such two,
Supposing him some neighbour villager;
Longer I durst not stay, but soon I guessed
Ye were the two she meant, with that I sprung
Into swift flight, till I had found you here,
But further know I not.

**2. Bro.** O night and shades,
How are ye joined with hell in triple knot
Against th' unarmed weakness of one Virgin
Alone, and helpless! Is this the confidence
You gave me, Brother?

**Eld. Bro.** Yes, and keep it still,
Lean on it safely, not a period
Shall be unsaid for me: against the threats
Of malice or of sorcery, or that power
Which erring men call Chance, this I hold firm,
Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt,
Surprised by unjust force, but not enthralled,
Yea even that which mischief meant most harm,
Shall in the happy trial prove most glory.
But evil on itself shall back recoil,
And mix no more with goodness, when at last
Gathered like scum, and settled to itself
It shall be in eternal restless change
Self-fed, and self-consumed, if this fail,
The pillared firmament is rottenness,
And earth's base built on stubble. But come, let's on.
Against th' opposing will and arm of Heaven
May never this just sword be lifted up,
But for that damned magician, let him be girt
With all the grisly legions that troop
Under the sooty flag of *Acheron*,
*Harpies* and *Hydras*, or all the monstrous forms
'Twixt Africa and *Inde*, I'll find him out,
And force him to restore his purchase back,
Or drag him by the curls, to a foul death,
Cursed as his life.

**Spir.** Alas, good venturous youth,
I love thy courage yet, and bold Emprise,
But here thy sword can do thee little stead,
Far other arms, and other weapons must
Be those that quell the might of hellish charms,
He with his bare wand can unthread thy joints,
And crumble all thy sinews.

**Eld. Bro.** Why, prithee, Shepherd,
How durst thou then thyself approach so near
As to make this relation?

**Spir.** Care and utmost shifts
How to secure the Lady from surprisal,
Brought to my mind a certain Shepherd Lad
Of small regard to see to, yet well skilled
In every virtuous plant and healing herb
That spreads her verdant leaf to th' morning ray,
He loved me well, and oft would beg me sing,
Which when I did, he on the tender grass
Would sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,
And in requital ope his leathern scrip,
And show me simples of a thousand names
Telling their strange and vigorous faculties;
Amongst the rest a small unsightly root,
But of divine effect, he culled me out;
The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,
But in another Country, as he said,
Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:
Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain
Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon,
And yet more medicinal is it than that *Moly*
That *Hermes* once to wise *Ulysses* gave;
He called it *Haemony*, and gave it me,
And bade me keep it as of sovran use
'Gainst all enchantments, mildew blast, or damp
Or ghastly furies' apparition;
I pursed it up, but little reckoning made,
Till now that this extremity compelled,
But now I find it true; for by this means
I knew the foul enchanter though disguised,
Entered the very lime-twigs of his spells,
And yet came off: if you have this about you
(As I will give you when we go) you may
Boldly assault the necromancer's hall;
Where if he be, with dauntless hardihood,
And brandished blade rush on him, break his glass,
And shed the luscious liquor on the ground,
But seize his wand, though he and his cursed crew
Fierce sign of battle make, and menace high,
Or like the sons of *Vulcan* vomit smoke,
Yet will they soon retire, if he but shrink.

**Eld. Bro.** *Thyrsis*, lead on apace, I'll follow thee,
And some good angel bear a shield before us.

### The Scene changes to a stately Palace, set out with all manner of deliciousness; soft Musick, Tables spread with all dainties. *Comus* appears with his rabble, and the Lady set in an enchanted Chair, to whom he offers his Glass, which she puts by, and goes about to rise.

***Comus*.** Nay, Lady, sit; if I but wave this wand,
Your nerves are all chained up in Alabaster,
And you a statue; or as *Daphne* was
Root-bound, that fled *Apollo*.

**La.** Fool, do not boast,
Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
With all thy charms, although this corporal rind
Thou hast immanacled, while Heaven sees good.

**Co.** Why are you vexed, Lady? Why do you frown?
Here dwell no frowns, nor anger, from these gates
Sorrow flies far: See here be all the pleasures
That fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,
When the fresh blood grows lively, and returns
Brisk as the April buds in Primrose-season.
And first behold this cordial Julep here
That flames, and dances in his crystal bounds
With spirits of balm, and fragrant Syrups mixed.
Not that *Nepenthes* which the wife of *Thone*,
In Egypt gave to Jove-born *Helena*
Is of such power to stir up joy as this,
To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.
Why should you be so cruel to yourself,
And to those dainty limbs which nature lent
For gentle usage, and soft delicacy?
But you invert the covenants of her trust,
And harshly deal like an ill borrower
With that which you received on other terms,
Scorning the unexempt condition
By which all mortal frailty must subsist,
Refreshment after toil, ease after pain,
That have been tired all day without repast,
And timely rest have wanted, but fair Virgin,
This will restore all soon.

**La.** 'Twill not, false traitor,
'Twill not restore the truth and honesty
That thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies,
Was this the cottage, and the safe abode
Thou told'st me of? What grim aspects are these,
These oughly-headed Monsters? Mercy guard me!
Hence with thy brewed enchantments, foul deceiver,
Hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
With visored falsehood, and base forgery,

```markdown
And wouldst thou seek again to trap me here
With lickerish baits fit to ensnare a brute?
Were it a draft for Juno when she banquets,
I would not taste thy treasonous offer; none
But such as are good men can give good things,
And that which is not good, is not delicious
To a well-governed and wise appetite.

Co. O foolishness of men! that lend their ears
To those budge doctors of the Stoic Fur,
And fetch their precepts from the Cynic Tub,
Praising the lean and sallow Abstinence.
Wherefore did Nature pour her bounties forth,
With such a full and unwithdrawing hand,
Covering the earth with odours, fruits, and flocks,
Thronging the Seas with spawn innumerable,
But all to please, and sate the curious taste?
And set to work millions of spinning Worms,
That in their green shops weave the smooth-haired silk
To deck her Sons, and that no corner might
Be vacant of her plenty, in her own loins
She hutched the all-worshipped ore, and precious gems
To store her children with; if all the world
Should in a pet of temperance feed on Pulse,
Drink the clear stream, and nothing wear but Freeze,
The all-giver would be unthanked, would be unpraised,
Not half his riches known, and yet despised,
And we should serve him as a grudging master,
As a penurious niggard of his wealth,
And live like Nature's bastards, not her sons,
Who would be quite surcharged with her own weight,
And strangled with her waste fertility;
The earth cumbered, and the winged air darked with plumes,
The herds would over-multitude their Lords,
The Sea overfraught would swell, and the unsought diamonds
Would so emblaze the forehead of the Deep,
And so bestud with Stars, that they below
Would grow inured to light, and come at last
To gaze upon the Sun with shameless brows.
List, Lady, be not coy, and be not cozened
With that same vaunted name Virginity,
Beauty is Nature's coin, must not be hoarded,
But must be current, and the good thereof
Consists in mutual and partaken bliss,
Unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself
If you let slip time, like a neglected rose
It withers on the stalk with languished head.
Beauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown
In courts, at feasts, and high solemnities
Where most may wonder at the workmanship;
It is for homely features to keep home,
They had their name thence; coarse complexions
And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
The sampler, and to tease the housewife's wool.
What need a vermeil-tinctured lip for that
Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the Morn?
There was another meaning in these gifts,
Think what, and be advised, you are but young yet.

La. I had not thought to have unlocked my lips
In this unhallowed air, but that this Juggler
Would think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,
Obtruding false rules pranked in Reason's garb.
I hate when vice can bolt her arguments,
And virtue has no tongue to check her pride:
Impostor, do not charge most innocent nature,
As if she would her children should be riotous
With her abundance, she, good cateress,
Means her provision only to the good
That live according to her sober laws,
And holy dictate of spare Temperance:
If every just man that now pines with want
Had but a moderate and beseeming share
Of that which lewdly-pampered Luxury
Now heaps upon some few with vast excess,
Nature's full blessings would be well dispensed
In unsuperfluous even proportion,
And she no whit encumbered with her store,
And then the giver would be better thanked,
His praise due paid, for swinish gluttony
Ne'er looks to Heaven amidst his gorgeous feast,
But with besotted base ingratitude
Crams, and blasphemes his feeder. Shall I go on?
Or have I said enough? To him that dares
Arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words
Against the Sun-clad power of Chastity,
Fain would I something say, yet to what end?
Thou hast nor Ear, nor Soul to apprehend
The sublime notion, and high mystery
That must be uttered to unfold the sage
And serious doctrine of Virginity,
And thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know
More happiness than this thy present lot.
Enjoy your dear Wit, and gay Rhetoric
That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence,
Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced;
Yet should I try, the uncontrolled worth
Of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits
To such a flame of sacred vehemence,
That dumb things would be moved to sympathize,
And the brute Earth would lend her nerves, and shake,
Till all thy magic structures reared so high,
Were shattered into heaps o'er thy false head.

Co. She fables not, I feel that I do fear
Her words set off by some superior power;
And though not mortal, yet a cold shuddering dew
Dips me all o'er, as when the wrath of Jove
Speaks thunder, and the chains of Erebus
To some of Saturn's crew. I must dissemble,
And try her yet more strongly. Come, no more,
This is mere moral babble, and direct
Against the canon laws of our foundation;
I must not suffer this, yet 'tis but the lees
And settlings of a melancholy blood;
But this will cure all straight, one sip of this
Will bathe the drooping spirits in delight
Beyond the bliss of dreams. Be wise, and taste.—

*The Brothers rush in with Swords drawn, wrest his Glass out of his hand, and break it against the ground; his rout make sign of resistance, but are all driven in; The attendant Spirit comes in*

Spir. What, have you let the false enchanter escape?
O ye mistook, ye should have snatched his wand
And bound him fast; without his rod reversed,
And backward mutters of dissevering power,
We cannot free the Lady that sits here
In stony fetters fixed, and motionless;
Yet stay, be not disturbed, now I bethink me,
Some other means I have which may be used,
Which once of Meliboeus old I learned
The soothest Shepherd that ere piped on plains.
There is a gentle Nymph not far from hence,
That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream,
Sabrina is her name, a Virgin pure,
Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine,
That had the Scepter from his father Brute.
The guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit
Of her enraged stepdame Guendolen,
Commended her fair innocence to the flood
That stayed her flight with his cross-flowing course,
The water Nymphs that in the bottom played,
Held up their pearled wrists and took her in,
Bearing her straight to aged Nereus' Hall,
Who piteous of her woes, reared her lank head,
And gave her to his daughters to imbathe
In nectared lavers strewn with Asphodel,
And through the porch and inlet of each sense
Dropped in Ambrosial Oils till she revived,
And underwent a quick immortal change
Made Goddess of the River; still she retains
Her maiden gentleness, and oft at Eve
Visits the herds along the twilight meadows,
Helping all urchin-blasts, and ill luck signs
That the shrewd meddling Elf delights to make,
Which she with precious vialed liquors heals.
For which the Shepherds at their festivals
Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays,
And throw sweet garland-wreaths into her stream
Of pansies, pinks, and gaudy Daffodils.
And, as the old Swain said, she can unlock
The clasping charm, and thaw the numbing spell,
If she be right invoked in warbled Song,
For maidenhood she loves, and will be swift
To aid a Virgin, such as was herself
In hard besetting need, this will I try
And add the power of some adjuring verse.

### SONG

Sabrina fair
Listen where thou art sitting
Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
In twisted braids of Lilies knitting
The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair,
Listen for dear honor's sake,
Goddess of the silver lake,
Listen and save.
Listen and appear to us
In name of great Oceanus,
By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,
And Tethys' grave majestic pace,
By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,
And the Carpathian wizard's hook,
By scaly Triton's winding shell,
And old sooth-saying Glaucus' spell,
By Leucothea's lovely hands,
And her son that rules the strands,
By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,
And the Songs of Sirens sweet,
By dead Parthenope's dear tomb,
And fair Ligea's golden comb,
Wherewith she sits on diamond rocks
Sleeking her soft alluring locks,
By all the Nymphs that nightly dance
Upon thy streams with wily glance,
Rise, rise, and heave thy rosy head
From thy coral-paven bed,
And bridle in thy headlong wave,
Till thou our summons answered have.
Listen and save.

*Sabrina rises, attended by water-Nymphs, and sings*

By the rushy-fringed bank,
Where grows the Willow and the Osier dank,
My sliding Chariot stays,
Thick set with Agate, and the azurn sheen
Of Turkis blue, and Emerald green
That in the channel strays,
Whilst from off the waters fleet
Thus I set my printless feet
O'er the Cowslip's velvet head,
That bends not as I tread,
Gentle swain, at thy request
I am here.

Spir. Goddess dear
We implore thy powerful hand
To undo the charmed band
Of true Virgin here distressed,
Through the force, and through the wile
Of unblest enchanter vile.

Sab. Shepherd, 'tis my office best
To help ensnared chastity;
Brightest Lady look on me,
Thus I sprinkle on thy breast
Drops that from my fountain pure,
I have kept of precious cure,
Thrice upon thy fingers tip,
Thrice upon thy rubied lip,
Next this marble venomed seat
Smeared with gums of glutinous heat
I touch with chaste palms moist and cold,
Now the spell hath lost its hold;
And I must haste ere morning hour
To wait in Amphitrite's bower.

*Sabrina descends, and the Lady rises out of her seat*

Spir. Virgin, daughter of Locrine
Sprung of old Anchises' line,
May thy brimmed waves for this
Their full tribute never miss
From a thousand petty rills,
That tumble down the snowy hills:
Summer drought, or singed air
Never scorch thy tresses fair,
Nor wet October's torrent flood
Thy molten crystal fill with mud,
May thy billows roll ashore
The beryl, and the golden ore,
May thy lofty head be crowned
With many a tower and terrace round,
And here and there thy banks upon
With groves of myrrh, and cinnamon.
Come, Lady, while Heaven lends us grace,
Let us fly this cursed place,
Lest the Sorcerer us entice
With some other new device.
Not a waste, or needless sound
Till we come to holier ground,
I shall be your faithful guide
Through this gloomy covert wide,
And not many furlongs thence
Is your Father's residence,
Where this night are met in state
Many a friend to gratulate
His wished presence, and beside
All the Swains that there abide,
With Jigs, and rural dance resort,
We shall catch them at their sport,
And our sudden coming there
Will double all their mirth and cheer;
Come let us haste, the stars grow high,
But night sits monarch yet in the mid-sky.

*The Scene changes, presenting Ludlow Town and the President's Castle, then come in Country-Dancers, after them the attendant Spirit, with the two Brothers and the Lady*

### SONG

Spir. Back Shepherds, back, enough your play,
Till next sunshine holiday,
Here be without duck or nod
Other trippings to be trod
Of lighter toes, and such Court guise
As Mercury did first devise
With the mincing Dryads
On the lawns, and on the leas.

*This second Song presents them to their father and mother*

Noble Lord, and Lady bright,
I have brought ye new delight,
Here behold so goodly grown
Three fair branches of your own,
Heaven hath timely tried their youth,
Their faith, their patience, and their truth.
And sent them here through hard assays
With a crown of deathless Praise,
To triumph in victorious dance
O'er sensual Folly, and Intemperance.

*The dances ended, the Spirit Epilogizes*

Spir. To the Ocean now I fly,
And those happy climes that lie
Where day never shuts his eye,
Up in the broad fields of the sky:
There I suck the liquid air
All amidst the gardens fair
Of Hesperus, and his daughters three
That sing about the golden tree:
Along the crisped shades and bowers
Revels the spruce and jocund Spring,
The Graces, and the rosy-bosomed Hours,
Thither all their bounties bring,
That there eternal Summer dwells,
And West winds, with musky wing
About the cedarn alleys fling
Nard, and Cassia's balmy smells.
Iris there with humid bow,
Waters the odorous banks that blow
Flowers of more mingled hue
Than her purfled scarf can show,
And drenches with Elysian dew
(List, mortals, if your ears be true)
Beds of Hyacinth, and roses
Where young Adonis oft reposes,
Waxing well of his deep wound
In slumber soft, and on the ground
Sadly sits the Assyrian Queen;
But far above in spangled sheen
Celestial Cupid her famed son advanced,
Holds his dear Psyche sweet entranced
After her wandering labors long,
Till free consent the gods among
Make her his eternal Bride,
And from her fair unspotted side
Two blissful twins are to be born,
Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.
But now my task is smoothly done,
I can fly, or I can run
Quickly to the green earth's end,
Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,
And from thence can soar as soon
To the corners of the Moon.
Mortals that would follow me,
Love virtue, she alone is free,
She can teach ye how to climb
Higher than the sphery chime;
Or if Virtue feeble were,
Heaven itself would stoop to her.

## POEMS ADDED IN THE 1673 EDITION

*Anno aetatis 17*
### On the Death of a fair Infant dying of a Cough

I
O fairest flower no sooner blown but blasted,
Soft silken Primrose fading timelessly,
Summer's chief honour if thou hadst outlasted
Bleak winter's force that made thy blossom dry;
For he being amorous on that lovely die
That did thy cheek envermeil, thought to kiss
But killed, alas, and then bewailed his fatal bliss.

II
For since grim Aquilo, his charioteer
By boisterous rape the Athenian damsel got,
He thought it touched his Deity full near,
If likewise he some fair one wedded not,
Thereby to wipe away the infamous blot,
Of long-uncoupled bed, and childless eld,
Which 'mongst the wanton gods a foul reproach was held.

III
So mounting up in icy-pearled car,
Through middle empire of the freezing air
He wandered long, till thee he spied from far,
There ended was his quest, there ceased his care.
Down he descended from his snow-soft chair,
But all unwares with his cold-kind embrace
Unhoused thy Virgin Soul from her fair biding-place.

IV
Yet art thou not inglorious in thy fate;
For so Apollo, with unweeting hand
Whilom did slay his dearly-loved mate
Young Hyacinth born on Eurotas' strand,
Young Hyacinth the pride of Spartan land;
But then transformed him to a purple flower
Alack, that so to change thee winter had no power.

V
Yet can I not persuade me thou art dead
Or that thy corpse corrupts in earth's dark womb,
Or that thy beauties lie in wormy bed,
Hid from the world in a low delved tomb;
Could Heaven for pity thee so strictly doom?
O no! for something in thy face did shine
Above mortality that showed thou wast divine.

VI
Resolve me then, O Soul most surely blest
(If so it be that thou these plaints dost hear)
Tell me bright Spirit where'er thou hoverest
Whether above that high first-moving Sphere
Or in the Elysian fields (if such there were.)
O say me true if thou wert mortal wight
And why from us so quickly thou didst take thy flight.

VII
Wert thou some Star which from the ruined roof
Of shook Olympus by mischance didst fall;
Which careful Jove in Nature's true behoof
Took up, and in fit place did reinstall?
Or did of late Earth's Sons besiege the wall
Of sheeny Heaven, and thou some goddess fled
Amongst us here below to hide thy nectared head.

VIII
Or wert thou that just Maid who once before
Forsook the hated earth, O tell me sooth
And cam'st again to visit us once more?
Or wert thou that sweet smiling Youth!
Or that crowned Matron sage white-robed Truth?
Or any other of that heavenly brood
Let down in cloudy throne to do the world some good.

IX
Or wert thou of the golden-winged host,
Who having clad thyself in human weed,
To earth from thy prefixed seat didst post,
And after short abode fly back with speed,
As if to show what creatures Heaven doth breed,
Thereby to set the hearts of men on fire
To scorn the sordid world, and unto Heaven aspire.

X
But O why didst thou not stay here below
To bless us with thy heaven-loved innocence,
To slake his wrath whom sin hath made our foe
To turn swift-rushing black perdition hence,
Or drive away the slaughtering pestilence,
To stand 'twixt us and our deserved smart
But thou canst best perform that office where thou art.

XI
Then thou the mother of so sweet a child
Her false imagined loss cease to lament,
And wisely learn to curb thy sorrows wild;
Think what a present thou to God hast sent,
And render him with patience what he lent;
This if thou do he will an offspring give,
That till the world's last end shall make thy name to live.

*Anno Aetatis 19. At a Vacation Exercise in the College, part Latin, part English. The Latin speeches ended, the English thus began*

Hail, native Language, that by sinews weak
Didst move my first endeavoring tongue to speak,
And mad'st imperfect words with childish trips,
Half unpronounced, slide through my infant-lips,
Driving dumb silence from the portal door,
Where he had mutely sat two years before:
Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask,
That now I use thee in my latter task:
Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee,
I know my tongue but little grace can do thee:
Thou needst not be ambitious to be first,
Believe me I have thither packed the worst:
And, if it happen as I did forecast,
The daintest dishes shall be served up last.
I pray thee then, deny me not thy aid
For this same small neglect that I have made:
But haste thee straight to do me once a Pleasure,
And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure;
Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming slight
Which takes our late fantasticks with delight,
But cull those richest Robes, and gayest attire
Which deepest Spirits, and choicest Wits desire:
I have some naked thoughts that rove about
And loudly knock to have their passage out;
And weary of their place do only stay
Till thou hast decked them in thy best array;
That so they may without suspect or fears
Fly swiftly to this fair Assembly's ears;
Yet I had rather if I were to choose,
Thy service in some graver subject use,
Such as may make thee search thy coffers round,
Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound:
Such where the deep-transported mind may soar
Above the wheeling poles, and at Heaven's door
Look in, and see each blissful Deity
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie,
Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings
To the touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings
Immortal Nectar to her kingly Sire:
Then passing through the Spheres of watchful fire,
And misty Regions of wide air next under,
And hills of Snow and lofts of piled Thunder,
May tell at length how green-eyed Neptune raves,
In Heaven's defiance mustering all his waves;
Then sing of secret things that came to pass
When Beldam Nature in her cradle was;
And last of Kings and Queens and Heroes old,
Such as the wise Demodocus once told
In solemn Songs at King Alcinous' feast,
While sad Ulysses' soul and all the rest
Are held with his melodious harmony
In willing chains and sweet captivity.
But fie, my wandering Muse, how thou dost stray!
Expectance calls thee now another way,
Thou know'st it must be now thy only bent
To keep in compass of thy Predicament:
Then quick about thy purposed business come,
That to the next I may resign my Room.

*Then Ens is represented as Father of the Predicaments, his ten Sons, whereof the Eldest stood for Substance with his Canons, which Ens, thus speaking, explains*

Good luck befriend thee, Son; for at thy birth
The Fairy Ladies danced upon the hearth;
Thy drowsy Nurse hath sworn she did them spy
Come tripping to the Room where thou didst lie;
And sweetly singing round about thy Bed
Strew all their blessings on thy sleeping Head.
She heard them give thee this, that thou shouldst still
From eyes of mortals walk invisible,
Yet there is something that doth force my fear,
For once it was my dismal hap to hear
A Sibyl old, bow-bent with crooked age,
That far events full wisely could presage,
And in Time's long and dark Prospective Glass
Foresaw what future days should bring to pass,
Your Son, said she, (nor can you it prevent)
Shall subject be to many an Accident.
O'er all his Brethren he shall reign as King,
Yet every one shall make him underling,
And those that cannot live from him asunder
Ungratefully shall strive to keep him under,
In worth and excellence he shall outgo them,
Yet being above them, he shall be below them;
From others he shall stand in need of nothing,
Yet on his Brothers shall depend for Clothing.
To find a Foe it shall not be his hap,
And peace shall lull him in her dowry lap;
Yet shall he live in strife, and at his door
Devouring war shall never cease to roar;
Yea it shall be his natural property
To harbor those that are at enmity.
What power, what force, what mighty spell, if not
Your learned hands, can loose this Gordian knot?

*The next, Quantity and Quality, spoke in Prose; then Relation was called by his Name*

Rivers, arise; whether thou be the Son,
Of utmost Tweed, or Ouse, or gulfy Dun,
Or Trent, who like some earth-born Giant spreads
His thirty Arms along the indented Meads,
Or sullen Mole that runneth underneath,
Or Severn swift, guilty of Maiden's death,
Or Rocky Avon, or of Sedgy Lee,
Or Coaly Tyne, or ancient hallowed Dee,
Or Humber loud that keeps the Scythian's Name,
Or Medway smooth, or Royal-Towered Thame.
*The rest was Prose*

### The Fifth Ode of Horace. Lib. I

*Quis multa gracilis te puer in Rosa,*
Rendered almost word for word without rhyme according to the Latin measure, as near as the language will permit

What slender Youth bedewed with liquid odors
Courts thee on Roses in some pleasant cave,
Pyrrha, for whom bind'st thou
In wreaths thy golden Hair,
Plain in thy neatness; O how oft shall he
On Faith and changed Gods complain: and seas
Rough with black winds and storms
Unwonted shall admire:
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all Gold,
Who always vacant, always amiable
Hopes thee; of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they
To whom thou untried seem'st fair. Me in my vowed
Picture, the sacred wall declares, to have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern God of Sea.

## SONNETS
1
Sonnets II—VI, written in Italian, are omitted.

I
O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy Spray
Warbl'st at eve, when all the woods are still,
Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill,
While the jolly hours lead on propitious May,
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of Day,
First heard before the shallow Cuckoo's bill
Portend success in love; O if Jove's will
Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay,
Now timely sing, ere the rude Bird of Hate
Foretell my hopeless doom in some Grove nigh:
As thou from year to year hast sung too late
For my relief; yet hadst no reason why,
Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,
Both them I serve, and of their train am I.

VII
How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stolen on his wing my twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on with full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom show'th.
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
That I to manhood am arrived so near,
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
Than some more timely-happy spirits indu'th.
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
It shall be still in strictest measure even,
To that same lot, however mean, or high,
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven;
All is, if I have grace to use it so,
As ever in my great Task-Master's eye.

VIII
Captain or Colonel, or Knight in Arms,
Whose chance on these defenseless doors may seize,
If ever deed of honor did thee please,
Guard them, and him within protect from harms,
He can requite thee, for he knows the charms
That call Fame on such gentle acts as these,
And he can spread thy Name o'er Lands and Seas,
Whatever clime the Sun's bright circle warms.
Lift not thy spear against the Muses' Bower,
The great Emathian Conqueror bid spare
The house of Pindarus, when Temple and Tower
Went to the ground: And the repeated air
Of sad Electra's Poet had the power
To save the Athenian Walls from ruin bare.

IX
Lady, that in the prime of earliest youth,
Wisely hath shunned the broad way and the green,
And with those few art eminently seen,
That labor up the Hill of heavenly Truth,
The better part with Mary and with Ruth,
Chosen thou hast, and they that overween,
And at thy growing virtues fret their spleen,
No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.
Thy care is fixed and zealously attends
To fill thy odorous Lamp with deeds of light,
And Hope that reaps not shame. Therefore be sure
Thou, when the Bridegroom with his feastful friends
Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,
Hast gained thy entrance, Virgin wise and pure.

X
Daughter to that good Earl, once President
Of England's Council, and her Treasury,
Who lived in both, unstained with gold or fee,
And left them both, more in himself content,
Till the sad breaking of that Parliament
Broke him, as that dishonest victory
At Chaeronea, fatal to liberty,
Killed with report that Old man eloquent,
Though later born than to have known the days
Wherein your Father flourished, yet by you
Madam, methinks I see him living yet;
So well your words his noble virtues praise,
That all both judge you to relate them true,
And to possess them, Honored Margaret.

XI
A Book was writ of late called *Tetrachordon*;
And woven close, both matter, form and style;
The Subject new: it walked the Town a while,
Numbering good intellects; now seldom pored on.
Cries the stall-reader, bless us! what a word on
A title-page is this! and some in file
Stand spelling false, while one might walk to Mile-
End Green. Why is it harder, Sirs, than Gordon,
Colkitto, or Macdonnel, or Galasp?
Those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek
That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp.
Thy age, like ours, O Soul of Sir John Cheke,
Hated not Learning worse than Toad or Asp;
When thou taught'st Cambridge, and King Edward
Greek.

XII On the same
I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs
By the known rules of ancient liberty,
When straight a barbarous noise environs me
Of Owls and Cuckoos, Asses, Apes and Dogs.
As when those Hinds that were transformed to Frogs
Railed at Latona's twin-born progeny
Which after held the Sun and Moon in fee.
But this is got by casting Pearl to Hogs;
That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood,
And still revolt when truth would set them free.
License they mean when they cry liberty;
For who loves that, must first be wise and good;
```

But from that mark how far they rove we see
For all this waste of wealth, and loss of blood.

### XIII
To Mr. H. Lawes, on his Aires

Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured Song
First taught our English Music how to span
Words with just note and accent, not to scan
With Midas' Ears, committing short and long;
Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,
With praise enough for Envy to look wan;
To after age thou shalt be writ the man,
That with smooth air couldst humor best our
tongue.
Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must send her wing
To honour thee, the Priest of Phoebus' Choir
That tun'st their happiest lines in Hymn or Story.
*Dante* shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
Than his *Casella*, whom he wooed to sing
Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.

### XIV

When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never,
Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
Of Death, called Life; which us from Life doth
sever.
Thy Works and Alms and all thy good Endeavor
Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
But as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
Followed thee up to joy and bliss forever.
Love led them on, and Faith, who knew them best,
Thy handmaids, clad them o'er with purple beams
And azure wings, that up they flew so dressed,
And speak the truth of thee on glorious Themes
Before the Judge, who thenceforth bade thee rest
And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.

### XV
On the late Massacre in Piedmont

Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered Saints, whose bones
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
When all our Fathers worshipped Stocks and Stones,
Forget not: in thy book record their groans
Who were thy Sheep and in their ancient Fold
Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that rolled
Mother with Infant down the rocks. Their moans
The vales redoubled to the hills, and they
To Heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow
O'er all th' Italian fields where still doth sway
The triple Tyrant: that from these may grow
A hundred-fold, who having learnt thy way
Early may fly the Babylonian woe.

### XVI

When I consider how my light is spent,
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
And that one Talent which is death to hide,
Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest he returning chide,
Doth God exact day-labor, light denied,
I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, 'God doth not need
Either man’s work or his own gifts; who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed
And post o'er Land and Ocean without rest:
They also serve who only stand and wait.'

### XVII

Lawrence, of virtuous Father virtuous Son,
Now that the fields are dank, and ways are miry,
Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
Help waste a sullen day; what may be won
From the hard Season gaining: time will run
On smoother, till *Favonius* re-inspire
The frozen earth; and clothe in fresh attire
The Lily and Rose, that neither sowed nor spun.
What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
Of *Attic* taste, with Wine, whence we may rise
To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice
Warble immortal Notes and *Tuscan* Air?
He who of those delights can judge and spare
To interpose them oft, is not unwise.

### XVIII

*Cyriac*, whose Grandsire on the Royal Bench
Of *British Themis*, with no mean applause
Pronounced and in his volumes taught our Laws,
Which others at their Bar so often wrench:
Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
In mirth, that after no repenting draws;
Let *Euclid* rest and *Archimedes* pause,
And what the Swede intends, and what the French.
To measure life, learn thou betimes, and know
Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
For other things mild Heaven a time ordains,
And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
That with superfluous burden loads the day,
And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.

### XIX

Methought I saw my late espoused Saint
Brought to me like *Alcestis* from the grave,
Whom *Jove's* great Son to her glad Husband gave,
Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint.
Mine as whom washed from spot of childbed taint,
Purification in the old Law did save,
And such, as yet once more I trust to have
Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
Her face was veiled, yet to my fancied sight,
Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined
So clear, as in no face with more delight.
But O, as to embrace me she inclined,
I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.

### On the new Forcers of Conscience under the Long PARLIAMENT

Because you have thrown off your Prelate Lord,
And with stiff Vows renounced his Liturgy
To seize the widowed whore Plurality
From them whose sin ye envied, not abhorred,
Dare ye for this adjure the Civil Sword
To force our Consciences that Christ set free,
And ride us with a classic Hierarchy
Taught ye by mere *A. S.* and *Rutherford*?
Men whose Life, Learning, Faith, and pure intent
Would have been held in high esteem with Paul,
Must now be named and printed Heretics
By shallow *Edwards* and Scotch what-d'ye-call:
But we do hope to find out all your tricks,
Your plots and packing worse than those of *Trent*,
That so the Parliament
May with their wholesome and preventive Shears
Clip your Phylacteries, though balk your Ears,
And succor our just Fears
When they shall read this clearly in your charge:
New Presbyter is but Old Priest writ Large.

### On the Lord Gen. Fairfax at the siege of Colchester

*Fairfax*, whose name in arms through Europe rings,
Filling each mouth with envy or with praise,
And all her jealous monarchs with amaze,
And rumors loud, that daunt remotest kings,
Thy firm unshaken virtue ever brings
Victory home, though new rebellions raise
Their Hydra heads, and the false North displays
Her broken league, to imp their serpent wings,
O yet a nobler task awaits thy hand;
For what can War, but endless war still breed,
Till Truth and Right from Violence be freed,
And Public Faith cleared from the shameful brand
Of Public Fraud. In vain doth Valor bleed
While Avarice and Rapine share the land.

### To the Lord General Cromwell May 1652
On the proposals of certain ministers at the Committee for Propagation of the Gospel

*Cromwell*, our chief of men, who through a cloud
Not of war only, but detractions rude,
Guided by faith and matchless Fortitude
To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed,
And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud
Hast reared God's Trophies, and his work pursued,
While *Darwen* stream with blood of Scots imbrued,
And *Dunbar* field resounds thy praises loud,
And *Worcester's* laureate wreath; yet much remains
To conquer still; peace hath her victories
No less renowned than war, new foes arise
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains:
Help us to save free Conscience from the paw
Of hireling wolves whose Gospel is their maw.

### To Sir Henry Vane the younger

*Vane*, young in years, but in sage counsel old,
Than whom a better Senator ne'er held
The helm of Rome, when gowns not arms repelled
The fierce *Epirot* and the African bold,
Whether to settle peace or to unfold
The drift of hollow states, hard to be spelled,
Then to advise how war may best upheld,
Move by her two main nerves, Iron and Gold
In all her equipage; besides to know
Both spiritual power and civil, what each means,
What severs each, thou hast learned, which few have done.
The bounds of either sword to thee we owe.
Therefore on thy firm hand religion leans
In peace, and reckons thee her eldest son.

### To Mr. Cyriac Skinner upon his Blindness

*Cyriac*, this three years' day, these eyes, though clear
To outward view, of blemish or of spot;
Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot,
Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear
Of Sun or Moon or Star throughout the year,
Or man or woman. Yet I argue not
Against Heaven's hand or will, nor bate a jot
Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
The conscience, Friend, to have lost them overplied
In liberty's defense, my noble task,
Of which all Europe talks from side to side.
This thought might lead me through the world's
vain mask
Content, though blind, had I no better guide.

## PSALMS

### PSALM I. Done into Verse, 1653

BLESS'D is the man who hath not walked astray
In counsel of the wicked, and i'th' way
Of sinners hath not stood, and in the seat
Of scorners hath not sat. But in the great
Jehovah's Law is ever his delight,
And in his Law he studies day and night.
He shall be as a tree which planted grows
By watery streams, and in his season knows
To yield his fruit, and his leaf shall not fall,
And what he takes in hand shall prosper all.
Not so the wicked, but as chaff which fanned
The wind drives, so the wicked shall not stand
In judgment, or abide their trial then,
Nor sinners in th' assembly of just men.
For the Lord knows th' upright way of the just,
And the way of bad men to ruin must.

### PSALM II. Done Aug. 8. 1653. Terzetti

Why do the Gentiles tumult, and the Nations
muse a vain thing, the Kings of th' earth upstand
With power, and Princes in their Congregations
Lay deep their plots together through each Land,
Against the Lord and his Messiah dear.
Let us break off, say they, by strength of hand,
Their bonds, and cast from us, no more to wear,
Their twisted cords: he who in Heaven doth dwell
Shall laugh, the Lord shall scoff them, then severe
Speak to them in his wrath, and in his fell
And fierce ire trouble them; 'but I,' saith he,
'Anointed have my King (though ye rebel)
On Sion my holy hill. A firm decree
I will declare; the Lord to me hath said
Thou art my Son I have begotten thee
This day; ask of me, and the grant is made;
As thy possession I on thee bestow
Th' Heathen, and as thy conquest to be swayed
Earth's utmost bounds: them shalt thou bring full low
With Iron Scepter bruised, and them disperse
Like to a potter's vessel shivered so.'
And now be wise at length, ye Kings averse,
Be taught, ye Judges of the earth; with fear
Jehovah serve, and let your joy converse
With trembling; kiss the Son, lest he appear
In anger, and ye perish in the way
If once his wrath take fire like fuel sere.
Happy all those who have in him their stay.

### PSALM III. Aug. 9. 1653
When he fled from *Absalom*

Lord, how many are my foes!
How many those
That in arms against me rise!
Many are they
That of my life distrustfully thus say,
'No help for him in God there lies.'
But thou, Lord, art my shield, my glory;
Thee through my story,
Th' exalter of my head I count.
Aloud I cried
Unto Jehovah; he full soon replied,
And heard me from his holy mount.
I lay and slept, I waked again,
For my sustain
Was the Lord. Of many millions,
The populous rout
I fear not, though encamping round about
They pitch against me their Pavilions.
Rise, Lord, save me, my God, for thou
Hast smote ere now
On the cheekbone all my foes,
Of men abhorred
Hast broke the teeth. This help was from the Lord;
Thy blessing on thy people flows.

### PSALM IV. Aug. 10. 1653

Answer me when I call,
God of my righteousness;
In straits and in distress
Thou didst me disinthrall,
And set at large; now spare,
Now pity me, and hear my earnest prayer.
Great ones, how long will ye
My glory have in scorn?
How long be thus forborne,
Still to love vanity,
To love, to seek, to prize
Things false and vain, and nothing else but lies?
Yet know the Lord hath chose,
Chose to himself a part
The good and meek of heart
(For whom to choose he knows)
Jehovah from on high
Will hear my voice what time to him I cry.
Be awed, and do not sin;
Speak to your hearts alone,
Upon your beds, each one,
And be at peace within.
Offer the offerings just
Of righteousness, and in Jehovah trust.
Many there be that say,
'Who yet will show us good?'
Talking like this world's brood;
But Lord, thus let me pray,
On us lift up the light,
Lift up the favor of thy countenance bright.
Into my heart more joy
And gladness thou hast put
Than when a year of glut
Their stores doth overcloy,
And from their plenteous grounds
With vast increase their corn and wine abounds.
In peace at once will I
Both lay me down and sleep,
For thou alone dost keep
Me safe where'er I lie,
As in a rocky cell
Thou, Lord, alone in safety mak'st me dwell.

### PSALM V. Aug. 12. 1653

Jehovah, to my words give ear,
My meditation weigh;
The voice of my complaining hear,
My King and God, for unto thee I pray.
Jehovah, thou my early voice
Shalt in the morning hear;
I'th' morning I to thee with choice
Will rank my Prayers, and watch till thou appear.
For thou art not a God that takes
In wickedness delight;
Evil with thee no biding makes.
Fools or mad men stand not within thy sight.
All workers of iniquity
Thou hat'st; and them unblest
Thou wilt destroy that speak a lie;
The bloody and guileful man God doth detest.
But I will in thy mercies dear,
Thy numerous mercies go
Into thy house; I in thy fear
Will towards thy holy temple worship low.
Lord, lead me in thy righteousness,
Lead me because of those
That do observe if I transgress,
Set thy ways right before, where my step goes.
For in his faltering mouth unstable
No word is firm or sooth;
Their inside, troubles miserable;
An open grave their throat, their tongue they smooth.
God, find them guilty, let them fall
By their own counsels quelled;
Push them in their rebellions all,
Still on; for against thee they have rebelled;
Then all who trust in thee shall bring
Their joy, while thou from blame
Defend'st them, they shall ever sing
And shall triumph in thee, who love thy name.
For thou, Jehovah, wilt be found
To bless the just man still,
As with a shield thou wilt surround
Him with thy lasting favor and good will.

### PSALM VI. Aug. 13. 1653

Lord, in thine anger do not reprehend me,
Nor in thy hot displeasure me correct;
Pity me, Lord, for I am much deject,
Am very weak and faint; heal and amend me,
For all my bones, that even with anguish ache,
Are troubled, yea, my soul is troubled sore;
And thou, O Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, restore
My soul, O save me for thy goodness' sake.
For in death no remembrance is of thee;
Who in the grave can celebrate thy praise?
Wearied I am with sighing out my days,
Nightly my couch I make a kind of sea;
My bed I water with my tears; mine eye
Through grief consumes, is waxen old and dark,
I'th' midst of all mine enemies that mark.
Depart, all ye that work iniquity.
Depart from me, for the voice of my weeping;
The Lord hath heard, the Lord hath heard my prayer.
My supplication with acceptance fair
The Lord will own, and have me in his keeping.
Mine enemies shall all be blank and dashed
With much confusion; then grow red with shame,
They shall return in haste the way they came,
And in a moment shall be quite abashed.

### PSALM VII. Aug. 14. 1653
Upon the words of *Cush* the Benjamite against him

Lord, my God, to thee I fly;
Save me and secure me under
Thy protection while I cry,
Lest as a lion (and no wonder)
He haste to tear my soul asunder,
Tearing and no rescue nigh.
Lord, my God, if I have thought
Or done this, if wickedness
Be in my hands, if I have wrought
Ill to him that meant me peace,
Or to him have rendered less,
And not freed my foe for naught;
Let th' enemy pursue my soul
And overtake it, let him tread
My life down to the earth and roll
In the dust my glory dead,
In the dust and there outspread,
Lodge it with dishonor foul.
Rise, Jehovah, in thine ire;
Rouse thyself amidst the rage
Of my foes that urge like fire;
And wake for me, their fury assuage;
Judgment here thou didst engage
And command which I desire.
So th' assemblies of each Nation
Will surround thee, seeking right,
Thence to thy glorious habitation
Return on high and in their sight.
Jehovah judgeth most upright
All people from the world's foundation.
Judge me, Lord, be judge in this
According to my righteousness
And the innocence which is
Upon me: cause at length to cease
Of evil men the wickedness
And their power that do amiss.
But the just establish fast,
Since thou art the just God that tries
Hearts and reins. On God is cast
My defense, and in him lies,
In him who both just and wise
Saves th' upright of heart at last.
God is a just Judge and severe,
And God is every day offended;
If th' unjust will not forbear,
His sword he whets, his bow hath bended
Already, and for him intended
The tools of death, that waits him near.
(His arrows purposely made he
For them that persecute.) Behold,
He travels big with vanity,
Trouble he hath conceived of old
As in a womb, and from that mold
Hath at length brought forth a lie.
He digged a pit, and delved it deep,
And fell into the pit he made,
His mischief that due course doth keep
Turns on his head, and his ill trade
Of violence will undelayed
Fall on his crown with ruin steep.
Then will I Jehovah's praise
According to his justice raise
And sing the Name and Deity
Of Jehovah the most high.

### PSALM VIII. Aug. 14. 1653

O Jehovah, our Lord, how wondrous great
And glorious is thy name through all the earth?
So as above the Heavens thy praise to set,
Out of the tender mouths of latest birth,
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, thou
Hast founded strength because of all thy foes,
To stint th' enemy, and slack th' avenger's brow
That bends his rage thy providence to oppose.
When I behold thy Heavens, thy fingers' art,
The Moon and Stars which thou so bright hast set,
In the pure firmament, then saith my heart,
O what is man that thou rememberest yet,
And think'st upon him; or of man begot,
That him thou visit'st and of him art found;
Scarce to be less than Gods, thou mad'st his lot,
With honor and with state thou hast him crowned.
O'er the works of thy hand thou mad'st him Lord,
Thou hast put all under his lordly feet,
All Flocks and Herds, by thy commanding word,
All beasts that in the field or forest meet.
Fowl of the Heavens, and Fish that through the wet
Sea-paths in shoals do slide. And know no dearth.
O Jehovah, our Lord, how wondrous great
And glorious is thy name through all the earth.

April, 1648 J. M.

Nine of the Psalms done into Metre, wherein all but what is in a different Character, are the very words of the Text, translated from the Original

### PSALM LXXX

¹ Thou Shepherd that dost Israel keep,
Give ear in time of need,
Who leadest like a flock of sheep
Thy loved *Joseph's* seed,
That sitt'st between the Cherubs bright,
Between their wings outspread,
Shine forth, and from thy cloud give light,
And on our foes thy dread.

² In *Ephraim's* view and *Benjamin's*,
And in *Manasseh's* sight,
Awake ¹ thy strength, come, and be seen
To save us by thy might.

³ Turn us again, thy grace divine
To us, O God, vouchsafe;
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
And then we shall be safe.

⁴ Lord God of Hosts, how long wilt thou,
How long wilt thou declare
Thy ² smoking wrath, and angry brow
Against thy people's prayer.

⁵ Thou feed'st them with the bread of tears,
Their bread with tears they eat,
And mak'st them ³ largely drink the tears
Wherewith their cheeks are wet.

⁶ A strife thou mak'st us and a prey
To every neighbor foe,
Among themselves they ⁴ laugh, they ⁴ play,
And ⁴ flouts at us they throw.

⁷ Return us, and thy grace divine,
O God of Hosts, vouchsafe;
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
And then we shall be safe.

⁸ A Vine from *Egypt* thou hast brought,
Thy free love made it thine,
And drov'st out Nations proud and haught
To plant this lovely Vine.

⁹ Thou did'st prepare for it a place
And root it deep and fast
That it began to grow apace,
And filled the land at last.

¹⁰ With her green shade that covered all,
The hills were overspread;
Her boughs as high as Cedars tall
Advanced their lofty head.

¹¹ Her branches on the western side
Down to the sea she sent,
And upward to that river wide
Her other branches went.

¹² Why hast thou laid her hedges low
And broken down her fence,
That all may pluck her, as they go,
With rudest violence?

¹³ The tusked boar out of the wood
Up turns it by the roots,
Wild beasts there browse, and make their food
Her grapes and tender shoots.

¹⁴ Return now, God of Hosts, look down
From Heaven, thy seat divine,
Behold us, but without a frown,
And visit this thy Vine.

¹⁵ Visit this Vine, which thy right hand
Hath set, and planted long,
And the young branch, that for thyself
Thou hast made firm and strong.

¹⁶ But now it is consumed with fire,
And cut with axes down,
They perish at thy dreadful ire,
At thy rebuke and frown.

¹⁷ Upon the man of thy right hand
Let thy good hand be laid,
Upon the Son of Man, whom thou
Strong for thyself hast made.

¹⁸ So shall we not go back from thee
To ways of sin and shame,
Quicken us thou, then gladly we
Shall call upon thy Name.
Return us, and thy grace divine,
Lord God of Hosts, vouchsafe;
Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
And then we shall be safe.

### PSALM LXXXI

¹ To God our strength sing loud and clear,
Sing loud to God our King,
To *Jacob's* God, that all may hear
Loud acclamations ring.

² Prepare a hymn, prepare a song,
The timbrel hither bring,
The cheerful psaltery bring along,
And harp with pleasant string.

³ Blow, as is wont, in the new moon,
With trumpets lofty sound,
Th' appointed time, the day whereon
Our solemn feast comes round.

⁴ This was a statute given of old
For Israel to observe,
A Law of *Jacob's* God, to hold
From whence they might not swerve.

⁵ This he a testimony ordained
In *Joseph*, not to change,
When as he passed through *Egypt* land;
The tongue I heard, was strange.

⁶ From burden, and from slavish toil
I set his shoulder free;
His hands from pots and miry soil
Delivered were by me.

⁷ When trouble did thee sore assail,
On me then didst thou call,
And I to free thee did not fail,
And led thee out of thrall.
I answered thee in ¹ thunder deep
With clouds encompassed round;
I tried thee at the water steep
Of *Meribah* renowned.

⁸ Hear, O my people, hearken well,
I testify to thee;
Thou ancient flock of Israel,
If thou wilt list to me,

⁹ Throughout the land of thy abode
No alien God shall be,
Nor shalt thou to a foreign God
In honor bend thy knee,

¹⁰ I am the Lord thy God which brought
Thee out of *Egypt* land;
Ask large enough, and I, besought,
Will grant thy full demand.

¹¹ And yet my people would not hear,
Nor hearken to my voice;
And Israel whom I loved so dear
Misliked me for his choice.

¹² Then did I leave them to their will
And to their wandering mind;
Their own conceits they followed still,
Their own devices blind.

¹³ O that my people would be wise
To serve me all their days,
And O that Israel would advise
To walk my righteous ways.

¹⁴ Then would I soon bring down their foes
That now so proudly rise,
And turn my hand against all those
That are their enemies.

¹⁵ Who hate the Lord should then be fain
To bow to him and bend,
But they, His people, should remain,
Their time should have no end.

¹⁶ And he would feed them from the shock
With flower of finest wheat,
And satisfy them from the rock
With honey for their meat.

### PSALM LXXXII

¹ God in the ¹ great ¹ assembly stands
Of Kings and lordly States,
Among the gods ² on both his hands
He judges and debates.

² How long will ye ³ pervert the right
With ³ judgment false and wrong,
Favoring the wicked by your might,
Who thence grow bold and strong?

³ ⁴ Regard the ⁴ weak and fatherless,
⁴ Dispatch the ⁴ poor man's cause,
And ⁵ raise the man in deep distress
By ⁵ just and equal Laws.

⁴ Defend the poor and desolate,
And rescue from the hands
Of wicked men the low estate
Of him that help demands.

⁵ They know not nor will understand,
In darkness they walk on,
The Earth's foundations all are ⁶ moved
And ⁶ out of order gone.

⁶ I said that ye were Gods, yea all
The Sons of God most high;
⁷ But ye shall die like men, and fall
As other Princes die.

⁸ Rise, God, ⁷ judge thou the earth in might,
This wicked earth ⁷ redress,
For thou art he who shalt by right
The Nations all possess.

### PSALM LXXXIII

¹ Be not thou silent now at length,
O God, hold not thy peace;
Sit not thou still, O God of strength,
We cry and do not cease.

² For lo, thy furious foes now ¹ swell
And ¹ storm outrageously,
And they that hate thee proud and fell
Exalt their heads full high.

³ Against thy people they ² contrive
³ Their plots and counsels deep,
⁴ Them to ensnare they chiefly strive
⁵ Whom thou dost hide and keep.

⁴ 'Come, let us cut them off,' say they,
'Till they no Nation be
That *Israel's* name for ever may
Be lost in memory.'

⁵ For they consult ⁶ with all their might,
And all as one in mind
Themselves against thee they unite
And in firm union bind.

⁶ The tents of *Edom*, and the brood
Of scornful *Ishmael*,
*Moab*, with them of *Hagar's* blood
That in the desert dwell,

⁷ *Gebal* and *Ammon* there conspire,
And hateful *Amalek*,
The *Philistines*, and they of *Tyre*
Whose bounds the sea doth check.

⁸ With them great *Asshur* also bands
And doth confirm the knot;
All these have lent their armed hands
To aid the Sons of *Lot*.

⁹ Do to them as to *Midian* bold,
That wasted all the coast.
To *Sisera*, and as is told
Thou didst to *Jabin's* host,
When at the brook of *Kishon* old
They were repulsed and slain,

¹⁰ At *Endor* quite cut off, and rolled
As dung upon the plain.

¹¹ As *Zeb* and *Oreb* evil sped,
So let their Princes speed;
As *Zeba* and *Zalmunna* bled,
So let their Princes bleed.

¹² For they amidst their pride have said,
'By right now shall we seize
God's houses, and will now invade
¹ Their stately Palaces.'

¹³ My God, oh make them as a wheel,
No quiet let them find,
Giddy and restless let them reel
Like stubble from the wind.

¹⁴ As when an aged wood takes fire
Which on a sudden strays,
The greedy flame runs higher and higher
Till all the mountains blaze,

¹⁵ So with thy whirlwind them pursue,
And with thy tempest chase;

¹⁶ ² And till they ² yield thee honor due,
Lord, fill with shame their face.

¹⁷ Ashamed and troubled let them be,
Troubled and shamed for ever,
Ever confounded, and so die
With shame, and scape it never.

¹⁸ Then shall they know that thou whose name
*Jehovah* is alone,
Art the most high, and thou the same
O'er all the earth art one.

## Miscellaneous Poems

### PSAL. LXXXIV

1 How lovely are thy dwellings fair!
    O Lord of Hosts, how dear
The pleasant Tabernacles are!
    Where thou dost dwell so near.

2 My Soul doth long and almost die
    Thy Courts O Lord to see,
My heart and flesh aloud do cry,
    O living God, for thee.

3 There e'en the Sparrow freed from wrong
    Hath found a house of rest,
The Swallow there, to lay her young
    Hath built her brooding nest,
E'en by thy Altars Lord of Hosts
    They find their safe abode,
And home they fly from round the Coasts
    Toward thee, My King, my God.

4 Happy, who in thy house reside
    Where thee they ever praise,

5 Happy, whose strength in thee doth bide,
    And in their hearts thy ways.

6 They pass through Baca's thirsty Vale,
    That dry and barren ground
As through a fruitful watery Dale
    Where Springs and Showers abound.

7 They journey on from strength to strength
    With joy and gladsome cheer
Till all before our God at length
    In Sion do appear.

8 Lord God of Hosts hear now my prayer
    O Jacob's God give ear,

9 Thou God our shield look on the face
    Of thy anointed dear.

10 For one day in thy Courts to be
    Is better, and more blest
Than in the joys of Vanity,
    A thousand days at best.
I in the temple of my God
    Had rather keep a door,
Than dwell in Tents, and rich abode
    With Sin for evermore.

11 For God the Lord both Sun and Shield
    Gives grace and glory bright,
No good from them shall be withheld
    Whose ways are just and right.

12 Lord God of Hosts that reign'st on high,
    That man is truly blest
Who only on thee doth rely,
    And in thee only rest.

### PSAL. LXXXV

1 Thy Land to favour graciously
    Thou hast not Lord been slack,
Thou hast from hard Captivity
    Returned Jacob back.

2 Th' iniquity thou didst forgive
    That wrought thy people woe,
And all their Sin, that did thee grieve
    Hast hid where none shall know.

3 Thine anger all thou hadst removed,
    And calmly didst return,
From thy fierce wrath which we had proved [^1]
    Far worse than fire to burn.

4 God of our saving health and peace,
    Turn us, and us restore,
Thine indignation cause to cease
    Toward us, and chide no more.

5 Wilt thou be angry without end,
    For ever angry thus
Wilt thou thy frowning ire extend
    From age to age on us?

6 Wilt thou not turn, and hear our voice [^2]
    And us again revive,
That so thy people may rejoice
    By thee preserved alive.

7 Cause us to see thy goodness Lord,
    To us thy mercy show
Thy saving health to us afford
    And life in us renew.

8 And now what God the Lord will speak
    I will go straight and hear,
For to his people he speaks peace
    And to his Saints full dear,
To his dear Saints he will speak peace,
    But let them never more
Return to folly, but surcease
    To trespass as before.

9 Surely to such as do him fear
    Salvation is at hand
And glory shall ere long appear
    To dwell within our Land.

10 Mercy and Truth that long were missed
    Now joyfully are met
Sweet Peace and Righteousness have kissed
    And hand in hand are set.

11 Truth from the earth like to a flower
    Shall bud and blossom then,
And Justice from her heavenly bower
    Look down on mortal men.

12 The Lord will also then bestow
    Whatever thing is good
Our Land shall forth in plenty throw
    Her fruits to be our food.

13 Before him Righteousness shall go
    His Royal Harbinger, [^3]
Then will he come, and not be slow
    His footsteps cannot err.

[^1]: Heb. The burning heat of thy wrath.
[^2]: Heb. Turn to quicken us.
[^3]: Heb. He will set his steps to the way.

### PSAL. LXXXVI

1 Thy Gracious ear, O Lord, incline,
    O hear me I thee pray,
For I am poor, and almost pine
    With need, and sad decay.

2 Preserve my soul, for I have trod [^4]
    Thy ways, and love the just,
Save thou thy servant O my God
    Who still in thee doth trust.

3 Pity me Lord for daily thee
    I call;

4 O make rejoice
    Thy servant's Soul; for Lord to thee
I lift my soul and voice,

5 For thou art good, thou Lord art prone
    To pardon, thou to all
Art full of mercy, thou alone
    To them that on thee call.

6 Unto my supplication Lord
    Give ear, and to the cry
Of my incessant prayers afford
    Thy hearing graciously.

7 I in the day of my distress
    Will call on thee for aid;
For thou wilt grant me free access
    And answer, what I prayed.

8 Like thee among the gods is none
    O Lord, nor any works
Of all that other Gods have done
    Like to thy glorious works.

9 The Nations all whom thou hast made
    Shall come, and all shall frame
To bow them low before thee Lord,
    And glorify thy name.

10 For great thou art, and wonders great
    By thy strong hand are done,
Thou in thy everlasting Seat
    Remainest God alone.

11 Teach me O Lord thy way most right,
    I in thy truth will bide,
To fear thy name my heart unite
    So shall it never slide.

12 Thee will I praise O Lord my God
    Thee honour, and adore
With my whole heart, and blaze abroad
    Thy name for evermore.

13 For great thy mercy is toward me,
    And thou hast freed my Soul
E'en from the lowest Hell set free
    From deepest darkness foul.

14 O God the proud against me rise
    And violent men are met
To seek my life, and in their eyes
    No fear of thee have set.

15 But thou Lord art the God most mild
    Readiest thy grace to show,
Slow to be angry, and art styled
    Most merciful, most true.

16 O turn to me thy face at length,
    And me have mercy on,
Unto thy servant give thy strength,
    And save thy handmaid's Son.

17 Some sign of good to me afford,
    And let my foes then see
And be ashamed, because thou Lord
    Dost help and comfort me.

[^4]: Heb. I am good, loving, a doer of good and holy things.

1 Among the holy Mountains high
    Is his foundation fast,
There Seated in his Sanctuary,
    His Temple there is placed.

2 Zion's fair Gates the Lord loves more
    Than all the dwellings fair
Of Jacob's Land, though there be store,
    And all within his care.

3 City of God, most glorious things
    Of thee abroad are spoken;

4 I mention Egypt, where proud Kings
    Did our forefathers yoke,
I mention Babel to my friends,
    Philistia full of scorn,
And Tyre with Ethiop's utmost ends,
    Lo this man there was born:

5 But twice that praise shall in our ear
    Be said of Zion last
This and this man was born in her,
    High God shall fix her fast.

6 The Lord shall write it in a Scroll
    That ne'er shall be outworn
When he the Nations doth enroll
    That this man there was born.

7 Both they who sing, and they who dance
    With sacred Songs are there,
In thee fresh brooks, and soft streams glance
    And all my fountains clear.

### PSAL. LXXXVIII

1 Lord God that dost me save and keep,
    All day to thee I cry;
And all night long, before thee weep
    Before thee prostrate lie.

2 Into thy presence let my prayer
    With sighs devout ascend
And to my cries, that ceaseless are,
    Thine ear with favour bend.

3 For cloyed with woes and trouble store
    Surcharged my Soul doth lie,
My life at death's uncheerful door
    Unto the grave draws nigh.

4 Reckoned I am with them that pass
    Down to the dismal pit
I am a man, but weak alas [^5]
    And for that name unfit.

5 From life discharged and parted quite
    Among the dead to sleep,
And like the slain in bloody fight
    That in the grave lie deep.
Whom thou rememberest no more,
    Dost never more regard,
Them from thy hand delivered o'er
    Death's hideous house hath barred.

6 Thou in the lowest pit profound
    Hast set me all forlorn,
Where thickest darkness hovers round,
    In horrid deeps to mourn.

7 Thy wrath from which no shelter saves
    Full sore doth press on me;
Thou break'st upon me all thy waves, [^6]
    And all thy waves break me.

8 Thou dost my friends from me estrange,
    And mak'st me odious,
Me to them odious, for they change,
    And I here pent up thus.

9 Through sorrow, and affliction great
    Mine eye grows dim and dead,
Lord all the day I thee entreat,
    My hands to thee I spread.

10 Wilt thou do wonders on the dead,
    Shall the deceased arise
And praise thee from their loathsome bed
    With pale and hollow eyes?

11 Shall they thy loving kindness tell
    On whom the grave hath hold,
Or they who in perdition dwell
    Thy faithfulness unfold?

12 In darkness can thy mighty hand
    Or wondrous acts be known,
Thy justice in the gloomy land
    Of dark oblivion?

13 But I to thee O Lord do cry
    Ere yet my life be spent,
And up to thee my prayer doth hie
    Each morn, and thee prevent.

14 Why wilt thou Lord my soul forsake,
    And hide thy face from me,

15 That am already bruised, and shake [^7]
    With terror sent from thee;
Bruised, and afflicted and so low
    As ready to expire,
While I thy terrors undergo
    Astonished with thine ire.

16 Thy fierce wrath over me doth flow
    Thy threatenings cut me through.

17 All day they round about me go,
    Like waves they me pursue.

18 Lover and friend thou hast removed
    And severed from me far.
They fly me now whom I have loved,
    And as in darkness are.

[^5]: Heb. A man without manly strength.
