## JOHN MILTON (1608-1674)

John Milton was an English poet, polemicist, and civil servant, widely regarded as one of the greatest poets in the English language. A learned humanist fluent in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and several modern languages, Milton served as Secretary for Foreign Tongues under Oliver Cromwell. He went blind in 1652 but continued his literary work, dictating his masterpiece *Paradise Lost* to his daughters.
